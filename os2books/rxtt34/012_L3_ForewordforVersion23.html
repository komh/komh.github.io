<H1>Foreword for Version 2.30</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.
<P>
<!--0xfb-->---------- * ----------

<P>
This version has only a few enhancements. One section you might look at
is the section <A HREF="119_L3_Pipes&Errorlevel.html">Pipes &amp; Errorlevel
</A>which explains how to get the errorlevel of all programs used in a pipe.

<P>

<P>
In this version I added some external links to show the message text for
<B>SYSnnnn</B> error messages; for example if you double-click on SYS0002
</A>you will get the OS/2 help for the OS/2 error SYS0002 (It's the same
as typing<B> HELP SYS0002</B> on the command line). And I've changed the
format of some tables to make them more useable (see <A HREF="896_L3_KeyCodesforkeyredefi.html">Key
codes for key redefinitions</A> for an example).
<P>
I've also added a new section with <A HREF="911_L1_NonREXXrelatedinform.html">Non-REXX
related information</A>. I need this information for our CID installation
&amp; upgrades.

<P>
Please note that I have only tested some of the included REXX programs/routines
with <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented REXX</A>.
For the few tests I've done, I've used <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented
REXX</A><B> OBJREXX 6.00 15 Jul 1996</B> (installed as the default REXX
interpreter in WARP 4).

<B>PS: </B> I didn't release a new version in August because I was very
busy and there were only a few new items.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
