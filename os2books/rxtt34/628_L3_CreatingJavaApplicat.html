<P>
This is an IBM Redbook about NetRexx. Here is a short description of the
book (stolen from the web site, see below):
<P>
"NetRexx is a new human-oriented language that makes writing and using Java
classes quicker and easier than writing in Java. NetRexx combines the ease
of use and flexibility of Rexx with the robust structure and portability
of Java.
<P>
This redbook covers all aspects of NetRexx, from simple scripting programs
to applications and applets using such advanced features as graphical user
interfaces with animation, access to relational databases, communication
over TCP/IP sockets, client/server programming using remote method invocation
(RMI), Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming, and JavaBeans. The sample
programs are freely available on the Internet.
<P>
This redbook applies to NetRexx Version 1.0 and 1.1, and the Java Development
Kit (JDK) Version 1.1.1. The sample programs were tested on Windows 95,
Windows NT, and OS/2 WARP; they should also run on other platforms that
support JDK 1.1.
<P>
<B>Chapter 1. "Introduction"</B>
<P>
explains the purpose of NetRexx, the installation of the product and the
sample programs, and the NetRexx documentation.
<P>
<B>Chapter 2. "Starting with NetRexx"</B>
<P>
describes a simple NetRexx program and shows how to compile and run it.
It also covers the file types used by NetRexx.
<P>
<B>Chapter 3. "The NetRexx Compiler"</B>
<P>
explains in detail how NetRexx programs are translated into Java programs.
It covers all compile options and explains how to invoke the compiler from
a NetRexx or Java program.
<P>
<B>Chapter 4. "The NetRexx Language"</B>
<P>
contains a comprehensive introduction to the NetRexx language.
<P>
<B>Chapter 5. "Using NetRexx As a Scripting Language"</B>
<P>
explains how NetRexx is used to write simple, straightforward programs without
explicitly coding Java classes. Included are subroutines and functions,
handling of parameters, and invocation of non-Java programs.
<P>
<B>Chapter 6. "Creating and Using NetRexx Classes"</B>
<P>
introduces object-oriented programming with NetRexx. Classes, methods, inheritance,
interfaces, class libraries, and packages are explained in detail.
<P>
<B>Chapter 7. "Creating Graphical User Interfaces"</B>
<P>
shows how NetRexx creates applications and applets with elaborate GUIs.
Many sample programs are provided to illustrate certain aspects of GUI programming,
such as layout managers, menus, dialogs, event handling, images, and keyboard
input. A package of useful classes is developed to simplify GUI programming
and solve common GUI problems.
<P>
<B>Chapter 8. "Threads"</B>
<P>
introduces threads for parallel processing, including starting, stopping,
and synchronization.
<P>
<B>Chapter<!-- entering slot 683 --> 9. "Handling Files"</B>
<P>
explains the different ways NetRexx can handle flat files, including line-mode,
byte-oriented, and data-oriented input/output. It also covers serialization,
that is, the storage and retrieval of objects in files.
<P>
<B>Chapter 10. "Database Connectivity with JDBC"</B>
<P>
shows how NetRexx programs access relational databases by using the Java
Database Connectivity API. Sample programs are developed to access the DB2
sample database.
<P>
<B>Chapter 11. "Network Programming"</B>
<P>
shows how to write network applications with sockets, universal resource
locators (URLs), and RMI. It concludes with a client/server implementation
of the JDBC application.
<P>
<B>Chapter 12. "Using NetRexx for CGI Programs"</B>
<P>
discusses how NetRexx can be used to write CGI programs for a Web server.
The sample programs access DB2 to create HTML pages.
<P>
<B>Chapter 13. "Creating JavaBeans With NetRexx"</B>
<P>
introduces JavaBeans and shows how to create simple beans with NetRexx for
use with VisualAge for Java.
<P>
<B>Chapter 14. "Why NetRexx?"</B>
<P>
summarizes the advantages of using NetRexx over Java.
<P>
<B>Appendix A. "Redbook Package Reference"</B>
<P>
describes the classes of the redbook package. The redbook package simplifies
GUI programming by providing solutions for many common problems."
