<H1>Foreword for Version 2.00</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.
<P>
In this version of RXT&amp;T I added some more icons representing links
to other pages and program calls from within RXT&amp;T. (see <A HREF="110_L3_IconsUsedinREXXTips&.html">Icons
Used in REXX Tips &amp; Tricks</A>). Also new in this version are links
to topics in the INF file titled<B> OS/2 Command reference</B>. And to distinguish
between internal and external links, external links are now marked with
a leading -symbol. (see also <A HREF="110_L3_IconsUsedinREXXTips&.html">Icons
Used in REXX Tips &amp; Tricks</A>). I also added some imbedded REXX code.

<P>
Other changes in this version: I've deleted the section<B> Optimizing REXX
programs</B>. Important information from this section is now merged into
the section <A HREF="154_L1_GeneralhintsforREXX.html">General hints for
REXX</A>. I've rearranged the sections <A HREF="112_L1_GeneralhintsforOS2&D.html">General
hints for OS/2 &amp; DOS commands</A>, <A HREF="154_L1_GeneralhintsforREXX.html">General
hints for REXX</A> and <A HREF="329_L1_ChangetheWPSwithREXX.html">Change
the WPS with REXX</A>. I think they are now more useful than before.
<P>
Of course there are again lots of new entries in this version. Some new
chapters you might take a look at are <A HREF="253_L2_ThePARSEinstruction.html">The
PARSE instruction</A> and <A HREF="254_L3_PARSEinstructionexam.html">PARSE
instruction examples</A>. These chapters contain a detailed description
of the
<BR>
PARSE</A> (&lt;-- this is an external link -- see the difference?) command
including a lot of examples showing how to use templates. Two other new
chapters you might read first are <A HREF="211_L3_CALLONSYNTAX.html">CALL
ON SYNTAX</A> and <A HREF="240_L3_ThefunctionRxFuncDro.html">The function
RxFuncDrop</A>.
<P>
And last: This version also contains an install program called<B> INSTALL.CMD
</B>to create or update an WPS object for RXT&amp;T.
<P>

<P>
Over the last year or two, my time and costs for maintaining RXT&amp;T have
increased dramaticly.  RXT&amp;T, now in its 10th iteration, has always
been distributed free of charge to interested users.  Due to the amount
of time and money required to update and produce RXT&amp;T, however, I am
thinking about adding some advertising for REXX related products to RXT&amp;T.
I am very interested in what users of RXT&amp;T think about this idea.  Also,
if you are interested in advertising in RXT&amp;T, please send me an email
indicating your interest.
<P>
I want to make it clear that at this time this is only something I'm thinking
about.  I do<B> not</B> have details about specific plans at this time.
I only want to know if there is some interest in the idea. It will involve
a lot of additional work for me to add advertising; therefore, I want to
be sure that there is reasonable interest in it before I take the time to
realize it.
