<H1>REXX programs without an extension</H1><!-- entering slot 313 -->
<P>

<P>
<B>Problem: </B> The REXX interpreter executes an external procedure from
a file<B> with any or without</B> an extension and/or without the leading
comment normally necessary for REXX programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Hint: </B> There's a bug in the OS/2 WARP REXX interpreter which allows
the use of files with any extension or without an extension for external
REXX procedures. These files also don't need the leading comment.
<BR>
Note that if there's a directory with the name of the external REXX procedure
prior to the REXX procedure in your PATH</A>, REXX tries to "execute" the
directory and fails with the error REX0003 - Program is unreadable.
<BR>
This bug was fixed in the WARP 3 FixPack #8 (Source:<B> <A HREF="1045_L0_.html">APAR
</A>PJ19105</B>) - and is again there after WARP 3 FixPack #17. It's still
there in WARP 4. And again fixed in Fixpack #6 for WARP 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
