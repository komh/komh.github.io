<H1>Getting the filename of WPDatafile objects</H1><!-- entering slot 393 -->
<P>
Sometimes it is necessary to get the filename of an object that is only
known by the Object ID. This is possible for all objects of type WPDatafile
and its childs classes.
<P>
For example, the classes <A HREF="394_L3_SetupstringsforWebEx.html">WebExplorer_Url
</A>(WARP 3) and <A HREF="398_L3_SetupstringsforWPUrl.html">WPUrl</A> (WARP
4) are children of the WPDatafile class. Therefore objects of both classes
are represented by a file. The URL referenced in this objects is saved in
this file as plain ASCII string and is identified by the WPS setup string
<B>LOCATOR</B>. The only way to retrieve this URL using plain REXX is, as
far as I know, to read the file.
<P>
To get the filename for an object referenced by an Object ID you can either
use Henk Kelder's <A HREF="663_L3_WPTOOLS.html">WPTOOLS</A>-DLL or you can
create an empty directory, copy the object into that directory (using SysCopyObject</A>)
and get the filename (using SysFileTree</A>).
