<H1>Global variables across more than one REXX program</H1><!-- entering slot 197 -->
<P>
It is not possible to have global variables across more than one REXX program
in Classic REXX, without the support of external modules that provide this
capability. (In <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented
REXX</A>, however, such global variables are possible; see <A HREF="282_L2_NewfeaturesinObjectR.html">New
features in Object REXX that are useful Classic REXX programs</A>). To get
around this limitation, a lot of DLLs for Classic REXX have been written
which contain functions to share global variables between REXX programs.

<P>
You may, for example, use the function<B> RxPassByName</B> from the DLL
<A HREF="774_L3_RXUpowerfulDLLforREX.html">RXU</A> to share variables between
two or more CMDs:
<P>
"One thing I'd want to emphasize in the description of<B> RxPassByName()
</B>is that it not only allows one Rexx program to call another, but most
importantly it allows two Rexx command files (.CMD) to share their variable
pools in a manner similar to the way the "EXPOSE" instruction lets different
procedures in a single .CMD file share their variables."

Another way to implement global variables across more than one REXX program
running in the same session is to use<B> Environment Variables</B>.
<P>
In this case, I suggest you use "read-only" environment variables (see <A HREF="185_L3_ReadonlyandWriteonly.html">Read-only
and Write-only environment variables</A>)
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Be aware that there seems to be a restriction for the maximum
length of the contents of an environment variable!
<BR>
If you have environment variables with more than 1024 characters you'll
get SYS3175 in CMD.EXE - sooner or later.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

A way to implement global variables across more than one REXX program running
in different sessions is to use<B> REXX Queues</B> - see  <A HREF="516_L3_UsingREXXqueuesforgl.html">Using
REXX queues for global variables</A> for some sample code to use this technique.

<P>
Be aware that there is no way to get a list of existing REXX queues. Therefore
you should not loose the name of your global variables if using this technique.
Note also that I don't know how much overhead there is for a REXX queue.
