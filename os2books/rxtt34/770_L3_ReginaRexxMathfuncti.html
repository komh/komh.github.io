Description of the author:
<P>
"Regmath is a pair of function libraries which provide a wide array of transcendental
functions. RxMath is meant to be compatible with the IBM RxMath library,
while rexxmath is meant to be compatible with an amigaRexx math library.
In both cases, the function libraries convert rexx variables to binary format
and call system math libraries to perform calculations. This approach favours
performance at the expense of precision. For the benefit of people who require
arbitrary precision, I've included John Brock's <A HREF="768_L3_RXXMATHArbitraryPrec.html">rxxmath
library</A>, which is written in Rexx and performs arbitrary precision calculations
(hence the description `Bumper Pack').
<P>
The package includes compiled versions for win32 and OS/2, and a manual
which is at once shorter and more informative than IBM's manual, and includes
three illustrations, two of them in colour. It also uses the word `disquisition'
in its ironic sense, which I believe is the first for a software manual."
