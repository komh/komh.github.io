Enhanced Visual Rexx (EVRexx) is a function package which enables the use
of PM dialog-windows from REXX-procedures without detailed knowledge of
PM programming.
<P>
Description from the author:
<P>
"This package was inspired by <A HREF="675_L3_VREXX.html">VREXX</A>, a similar
package written by R.B.Lam of IBM T.J.Watson Research Center
<P>
VREXX has a number of limitations which are overcome with EVRexx:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->EVRexx can be used by more than one process at a time.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->With EVRexx you can (and must) define your own dialog
windows. Therefore it is possible to mix controls.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->EVRexx allows modeless dialog windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Recovery of system resources in case of fatal (REXX-)
errors.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Dialog windows are entered into the window list<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The price you pay for all the enhancements of EVRexx is that the package
is not quite as easy to use as VREXX. In addition, the graphic capabilities
of VREXX are not yet implemented in this release of EVRexx.
<P>
To use EVRexx, you have to code the appropriate function calls in a REXX-program
and you have to supply a resource DLL with all the dialogs you want to show.
Although a resource compiler and a linker are part of OS/2, it is quite
cumbersome to design dialogs without a dialog editor (like the one supplied
with the developer's toolkit). The dialog editor creates a resource script
file which you would otherwise have to create by hand. The script file is
compiled by the resource compiler and linked to a DLL by a linker."
