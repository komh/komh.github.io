  Key Name         Value          Description
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  HOSTNAME         hostname       This sets the hostname to be
                                  accessed using an FTP Host
                                  object.  This value is designated
                                  in the "Hostname" field on the
                                  Host page.
                                  For example:
                                    ftp.software.ibm.com

  USERNAME         username       This sets the username to be used
                                  when accessing a hostname using
                                  an FTP Host object.  This value
                                  is designated in the "Username"
                                  field on the Host page.

  PASSWORD         password       This sets the password to be used
                                  to access the given host with a
                                  given username.  This value is
                                  designated in the "Password"
                                  field on the Host page. This
                                  value is not required when the
                                  object is created.  If one is not
                                  specified, the user will be
                                  prompted to enter a password when
                                  the host is accessed. If
                                  specified, passwords are stored
                                  in an encrypted form when set.

  ACCOUNT          account        This sets the account value to be
                                  used when accessing a given
                                  hostname or username using the
                                  FTP Host object.  This value is
                                  designated in the "Account" field
                                  on the Host page.  This value is
                                  required only when the FTP server
                                  being accessed maintains account
                                  information for host accesses.

  FILETRANSFERTYPE
                   ASCII          This sets the default file
                                  transfer mode for an FTP Host
                                  object.  This value is designated
                                  by selecting the ASCII "Default
                                  download type" radio button on
                                  Host page 1.

                   BINARY         This is the default file transfer
                                  mode.  This value is designated
                                  by selecting the BINARY "Default
                                  download type" radio button on
                                  Host page 1.

  REMOTEDIR        path           This specifies which directory
                                  will be used as the initial
                                  working directory when connecting
                                  to a host system using the
                                  specified FTP Host object.  For
                                  example:
                                    e:\public\bin,., /

                                  This value is designated in the
                                  "Preferred remote directory"
                                  field on the Host page 2.  The
                                  syntax of this path specification
                                  must be in a format understood by
                                  the remove host's operating
                                  system.  The given username and
                                  account must have permissions set
                                  to access this directory on the
                                  remote host.

  LOCALDIR         path           This specifies the directory to
                                  be used as the default download
                                  directory for GET operations
                                  using the FTP Host object if one
                                  is not explicitly indicated.
                                  This value is designated in the
                                  "Preferred local (download)
                                  directory" field on Host page 2.

  INCLUDE          pattern        This is used to filter remote
                                  files and directories from the
                                  FTP Host object's open views.
                                  This value is designated in the
                                  "Only display files matching
                                  pattern" field on the Include
                                  page.  The syntax of the pattern
                                  must be understood by the remote
                                  host's operating system.
