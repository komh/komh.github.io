<P>
If you're using compound variables completely defined in your source code,
you may use a technique I call "open compound variables" shown in the example
below.
<BR>
The advantage of this method: You can add new variables to the end of the
compound variable without maintaining a counter (stem.0 is not used). I
often forget to correct the counter after adding new entries to the compound
variable.
<BR>
Note that using this method in Classic REXX is only useful if you define
the compound variable completely in the source code (no changes at runtime)!

<BR>
In <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented REXX</A> you
can use it anyway because there you can get all stem entries very simply
with the<B> DO ... OVER</B> construct (see the code at the end of the example).
 
<PRE> 
/* sample for using "open" compound variables                         */

                    /* drop the stem (to be sure)                     */
  drop nameStem.

                    /* define the compound variable                   */
  nameStem.1 = "Albert"
  nameStem.2 = "Robert"
  nameStem.3 = "William"

                    /* use the compound variable                      */

                    /* use the function symbol to find the last entry */
                    /* of the compound variable                       */

  do i = 1 while symbol( "nameStem." || i ) = "VAR"

    say "Entry no. " || i || " is " nameStem.i

  end /* do i = 1 while symbol( "nameStem." || i ) = "VAR" */

                     /* Note: i-1 is the number of stem entries. You  */
                     /*       can save this value in the variable     */
                     /*       nameStem.0 and use the normal methods   */
                     /*       in the rest of your program.            */

  say "The compound variable contains " || i-1 || " entries."

/* another useful method for a loop over all entries            v2.50 */
/* Note that this method is only possible in Object REXX!!!     v2.50 */

   parse version thisVersion .
   if thisVersion = "OBJREXX" then
   do
     say "In Object REXX you can use also the DO OVER construct:"

     j = 0;
     do i over nameStem.
       j = j + 1;
       say "Entry no. " || i || " is " namestem.i
     end /* do i over namestem. */
     say "The compound variable contains " || j || " entries."

  end /* if thisVersion = "OBJREXX" then */
