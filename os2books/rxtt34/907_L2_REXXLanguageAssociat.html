The Rexx Language Association was established to further the understanding
and use of the Rexx programming language. With the release of Object Rexx
and NetRexx, RexxLA has expanded its mission to include these languages
as well. The Association is headquartered at the Research Triangle Park
in North Carolina, and its international scope with members throughout the
world. Supported by a dedicated group of volunteers, the Rexx Langauge Association
provides many benefits for its members.
<P>
In addition to a listserver which provides a forum for member discussions
and assistance via email, RexxLA now has a website (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>). The members-only web pages feature news and articles of
interest to Classic Rexx, Object Rexx, and Netrexx users. While currently
under construction, there will be sample programs, shareware, reviews of
Rexx packages, tips, tricks, and tutorials, as well as  a listing of commercial
software written using a Rexx language. We also plan to print a newsletter
to the best of the webpages, for saving and reference. If you have a Rexx
question, RexxLA can provide you with the answer.
<P>
RexxLA sponsors the annual <A HREF="908_L2_RexxSymposium.html">Rexx Symposium
</A>which features presentations by recognized Rexx experts and practitioners,
interesting products, and an opportunity to network and to learn from people
who share your enthusiasm for Rexx. All of the major Rexx vendors attend,
giving you the opportunity to interact directly with them and provide them
with valuable feedback from the field. Usually held in the US, the Symposium
was in Heidelberg, Germany this year (1997) to accommodate our many international
members. A RexxLA membership also entitles you to a discounted registration
fee at the Symposium.
<P>
From the very first, the Rexx Language Association has been an active member
of the commitee working on an <A HREF="909_L2_REXXANSIStandard.html">ANSI
Standard for REXX</A>. That Standard has been approved, and we are now involved
in drafting an ANSI Standard for Object Rexx and NetRexx. Your membership
gives you a voice in this very important work.
<P>
If you write sophisticated applications in Object Rexx, design Java-enhanced
webpages with NetRexx, or simply use Rexx to make your life easier on any
platform, the RExx Language Association has much to offer you.
<P>
Join your colleagues in the RexxLA today!
