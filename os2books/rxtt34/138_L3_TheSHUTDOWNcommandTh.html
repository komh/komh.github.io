<H1>The SHUTDOWN command / The SETBOOT command</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
Use the command<B> SHUTDOWN</B> to perform a system shutdown from the command
line or a batch or REXX program. SHUTDOWN needs no parameter.
<BR>
You can also use the command
<P>
SETBOOT</A> /IBD:<B><I>x</B></I>
<BR>

<P>
where<B><I> x</B></I> is the drive you want to boot from next or a non-existing
drive if you do not want to reboot the PC.
<P>
The difference between them:
<P>
Using<B> SHUTDOWN</B> OS/2 pops up a warning dialog for every open DOS or
OS/2 session, whereas SETBOOT</A> closes all DOS, Windows and OS/2 applications
without any prompting.
<P>
Beginning with Fixpack #6 for WARP 4 there is another program to perform
a system shutdown from the command line:<B> TSHUTDWN.EXE</B>.
<P>
TSHUTDWN.EXE does a normal system shutdown without pop up dialogs for OS/2
or DOS sessions. Note that you must unpack TSHUTDWN.EXE manually using the
command
<PRE> 
   unpack TSHUTDWN.EX_
</PRE>

<P>
if you don't have a machine with WarpSpace on Demand. The file TSHUTDWN.EX_
is in the fixpack directory \OS2.3.
<P>
According to a note from Armin Schwarz (see <A HREF="961_L2H_EMailaddressesS.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) there are some restrictions using TSHUTDWN.EXE:
<P>
"The readme of Warp4 FP8 says to use /N to eliminate any prompts when shutting
down. I found no difference between using /N or not using that option.
<P>
TSHUTDWN does shut down OS/2 window, DOS and seamless WIN-OS2 window sessions
without prompting. BUT IT WILL PROMPT TO CLOSE A FULLSCREEN OS/2 SESSION.

<P>
TSHUTDWN must be used on a Warp 4 FP8 system. IT WILL NOT SHUTDOWN WITHOUT
PROMPTING ON ANY OTHER WARP 3 OR 4 SYSTEMS. In other words, TSHUTDWN works
just like SHUTDOWN on Warp 3 and Warp 4 (pre FP6). "
