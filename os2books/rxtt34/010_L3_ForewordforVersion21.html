In this version I've added some additional information about EAs (see <A HREF="334_L2_ExtendedAttributeDat.html">Extended
Attribute Data Types</A>, <A HREF="333_L2_ExtendedAttributesus.html">EAs
used by the WPS</A> and <A HREF="476_L3_MaintainMultiValueEA.html">Maintain
Multi value EAs in REXX</A>).
<BR>
Another new section you might find interesting is <A HREF="504_L3_REXXWrapperfortextmo.html">REXX
Wrapper for text-mode programs</A>. This is a sample REXX program to call
another program, filtering it's input and output using only standard REXX
features (pipes and queues).
<P>
I've also changed the policy for software mentioned in the <A HREF="634_L1_AdditionalSoftwarefo.html">Software
section</A>:
<BR>
Beginning with this version I include selected shareware also. To distinguish
between free software and shareware the section titles for shareware programs
are marked with a trailing dollar sign<B> ($)</B>

One of the most useful tools for OS/2 I've found so far is <A HREF="638_L3_LXliteacompressorfor.html">LX
lite -- a compressor for OS/2 executables</A>. LXLite can compress mostly
every OS/2 executable and thus is a<B> very</B> useful tool for creating
emergency diskettes or CID boot diskettes. I strongly suggest you take a
look at it!

My request for comments about adding advertising to RXT&amp;T in the last
version of RXT&amp;T was not very successful. So I'll move this topic to
a future release of RXT&amp;T.
