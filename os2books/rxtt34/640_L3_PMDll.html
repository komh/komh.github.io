Description from the author:
<P>
"PMDLL is an OS/2 presentation manager program that shows you the complete
tree of DLLs loaded by an OS/2 executable file or by a DLL (both 16 and
32 bit formats are supported). Sometimes it's uncertain why a program won't
start (correctly) or behaves strange when running. When this program is
using DLLs one of the causes can be that DLLs can't be found or that DLLs
are loaded from unexpected directories which contain an incorrect version
of the DLL. PMDLL gives you an easy way to detect these kind of problems."

<P>
<B>PMDLL</B> is a<B> very</B> useful tool to detect the further DLLs needed
by a REXX dll (see <A HREF="295_L2_DLLloadingfailed.html">DLL loading failed</A>).
