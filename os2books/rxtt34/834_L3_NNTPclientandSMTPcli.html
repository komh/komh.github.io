Description from the author:

"This package contains three rexx utilities that can be used to collect
news and mail, and/or deliver mail.  They are written in OS/2 Rexx using
RxSock.  They can be used interchangeably with KA9Q."
<P>
Note that this package also contains a REXX DLL with a routine to handle
regular-expressions (including the source). Following is the description
for this routine taken from the source code:
<PRE> 
From: rs@mirror.TMC.COM (Rich Salz)
Newsgroups: net.sources
Subject: Small shell-style pattern matcher
Message-ID: &lt;596@mirror.TMC.COM&gt;
Date: 27 Nov 86 00:06:40 GMT

There have been several regular-expression subroutines and one or two
filename-globbing routines in mod.sources.  They handle lots of
complicated patterns.  This small piece of code handles the *?[]\
wildcard characters the way the standard Unix(tm) shells do, with the
addition that "[^.....]" is an inverse character class -- it matches
any character not in the range ".....".  Read the comments for more
info.

For my application, I had first ripped off a copy of the "glob" routine
from within the find(1) source, but that code is bad news:  it recurses
on every character in the pattern.  I'm putting this replacement in the
public domain.  It's small, tight, and iterative.  Compile with -DTEST
to get a test driver.  After you're convinced it works, install in
whatever way is appropriate for you.

I would like to hear of bugs, but am not interested in additions; if I
were, I'd use the code I mentioned above.

**  Do shell-style pattern matching for ?, \, [], and * characters.

/*
 * Modified 6Nov87 by John Gilmore (hoptoad!gnu) to return a "match"
 * if the pattern is immediately followed by a "/", as well as \0.
 * This matches what "tar" does for matching whole subdirectories.
 *
 * The "*" code could be sped up by only recursing one level instead
 * of two for each trial pattern, perhaps, and not recursing at all
 * if a literal match of the next 2 chars would fail.
 */

/* Modified by Anders Klemets to take an array of pointers as an optional
   argument. Each part of the string that matches '*' is returned as a
   null-terminated, malloced string in this array.
