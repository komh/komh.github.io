The Developer Connection is an annual subscription program for application
developers. Its purpose is to deliver: licenses to developers for toolkits,
productivity tools, development tools and sample code; licenses to the latest
pre-release code so developers can prepare for and simulate future environments;
 and the most up-to-date versions of technical documentation on Java, OS/2,
and AIX. The Developer Connection consists of four issues ( CDs and a newsletter),
delivered over the course of one year, plus full access to the DevCon website
until the subscription expires.
