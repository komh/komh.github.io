<H1>Using Persistent Variables</H1><!-- entering slot 198 -->
<P>
Persistent variables are variables, that don't lose their values between
two runs of a program (even if you reboot your PC between the run).
<P>
There is no native support for persistent variables in REXX. Therefore you
must implement the save and load process of those variables in your program
yourself.
<P>
You can use a data file or an INI file (but not OS2.INI!) for this purpose.

<P>
Another place to save persistent variables is in the Extended Attributes
of your REXX program. The adavantage of this method is, that you can move
or copy the REXX program and the persistent variables will always be there.
I've found this very clever hint in a message from Erik Schneller (see <A HREF="961_L2H_EMailaddressesS.html">EMail
Addresses</A>).
<BR>
Note that you should use the defined format for Extended Attributes also
for your new Extended Attributes - see <A HREF="334_L2_ExtendedAttributeDat.html">Extended
Attribute Data Types</A> - and you shouldn't use one of the predefined Extended
Attributes - see <A HREF="333_L2_ExtendedAttributesus.html">Extended Attributes
used by the WPS</A>.
<P>
One disadvantage of this method is, that you'll lose the persistent variables
if you use a DOS/Windows program to process the file. Note further that
the maximum size of all Extended Attributes is limited to 64 K and that
your new Extented Attributes may prevent the REXX interpreter from saving
the token image of your REXX program in the EAs (see <A HREF="265_L3_Creatingatokenimage.html">Creating
a token image</A>)
<P>
(see <A HREF="515_L3_Sampleforpersistentv.html">Sample for persistent variables
</A>for a working example using Extended Attributes for persistent variables)
