Description from the author:
<P>
"The VIPER Database Engine(TM) is a portable, scaleable database engine
written entirely in the C-Language. Its modular structure makes it easily
portable to other operating systems (next OS is Linux!). An MS/PCDOS version
currently exists. It uses an ISAM/B+tree implementation for databased services.

<P>
The VIPER Database Engine(TM) for OS/2 is a 32-bit native code database
engine for the IBM OS/2 operating system (OS/2 version 2.0 and above). It
contains C-Language and REXX APIs. This preview release is in preparation
for the VIPER Database Engine (version 1.0.0) general release. API documentation
for the PREVIEW RELEASE 0.9.X is available for the REXX API only! (sorry,
C-Language API will be available soon).
<P>
<B>VERSION SPECIFIC INFORMATION</B>
<P>
This version of the VIPER Database Engine is primarily for evaluation and
testing.  It is the first OS/2 port and as such may have some bugs. The
purpose of circulating this PREVIEW RELEASE is to detect and eliminate any
bugs or software defects through user feedback."
