<H1>"Compiling" REXX programs</H1><!-- entering slot 948 -->
<P>
I don't know of a real REXX compiler for OS/2 REXX. But because the REXX
interpreter stores an tokenized copy of each REXX program in the EAs of
the program, it is possible to delete the source code from REXX programs
(see <A HREF="647_L3_REXXCCaREXXcompiler.html">REXXCC</A>). Another method
to "compile" a REXX program is used by the program <A HREF="648_L3_RxCLSaREXXcompiler$.html">RxCLS
($)</A>. But this is also no real compiler.
<P>
The only method to create a standalone REXX program that runs on any machine
with or without REXX installed is to create an EXE containing the REXX program
<B>and</B> a static version of a REXX interpreter.
<BR>
This is possible with the package <A HREF="658_L3_RexxWrapper.html">Rexx/Wrapper
</A>and the REXX Interpreter Regina from Mark Hessling (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>)
<P>
To "compile" an <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented
REXX</A> program you can use the program<B> REXXC.EXE</B> which is part
of <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented REXX</A>.<B> REXXC.EXE
</B>creates the token image and saves it in a REXX cmd. This method avoids
the 64 K limit for the token image. (see also the <A HREF="901_L3_Creatingcompiledprog.html">Creating
"compiled" programs for Classic REXX and Object REXX</A>)
<P>
Another method to create a token image of your REXX program is to load the
REXX program into the macro space and save the macro space into a file.
This will produce a token image of your REXX program that you can reload
into the macrospace and execute it from there. This method also avoids the
64 K limit of the EAs. (see <A HREF="647_L3_REXXCCaREXXcompiler.html">REXXCC
- a REXX "compiler"</A>)
<BR>
In this case you need an additional loader to load the token image into
the macro space again before you can execute it.
<P>
Or use <A HREF="555_L3_LoadMaccmd.html">LoadMac.cmd</A> to create and laod
the token image:
<PRE> 
REM *** Create the token image
LOADMAC CLEAR ADD:myProg.CMD SAVE:myProg.IMG

REM *** Load the image into the REXX macro space
LOADMAC CLEAR LOAD:MyProg.IMG

REM *** Execute the image
REXXTRY call myprog myparms

REM *** Drop the image from the REXX macro space
LOADMAC DROP:MyProg

REM *** or (if the image contains more than one macro)
LOADMAC CLEAR
</PRE>
