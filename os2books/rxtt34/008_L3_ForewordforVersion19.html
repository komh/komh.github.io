And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.
<P>
This version includes additional information from various OS/2 WARP <A HREF="1045_L0_.html">APAR</A>s
regarding REXX. Please be aware that APARs are living documents! So, if
you want to use some information collected from an APAR, always get the
newest version of the referenced APAR. There likely is already a fix or
workaround for the problem. by the time you contact IBM to get a copy of
the APAR.
<P>
Beginning with this version the current version of RXT&amp;T is also available
in the internet at the home page of<B> Quercus Systems</B> (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>). BTW: The home page of Quercus Systems contains some very
useful information about REXX. So I strongly suggest you take a look at
it.
<P>
This is the last version of RXT&amp;T for this year -- Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year to all users of RXT&amp;T.
