<H1>Using meta chars</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
To use one of the OS/2 meta chars (e.g. |, &lt;, &gt;, ...) as normal, literal
chars in OS/2 commands you can precede the meta char with a caret<B> ^</B>.
This char, known as an "escape character", will keep the meta char from
being interpreted by the shell.
<P>
Thus, whereas the meta char "&gt;" normally will redirect output from a
program or other source, the two characters "^&gt;" will be seen by the
system as "&gt;" with no special meaning. This is one way in which you could
execute the following command without producing an error:
<PRE> 
  echo The objectID of the Connection folder is ^&lt;WP_CONNECTIONSFOLDER^&gt;.
</PRE>

<P>
To use a literal caret character you must use<B> ^^</B>.
<P>
The other method to use these chars as literal chars is to surround the
whole string with double quotes<B> "</B>.
<P>
To prevent the CMD.EXE from interpreting the percent char<B> %</B> you can
also use two of them:<B> %%</B>. That's also necessary if you want to use
the percent char in a string enclosed in double quotes.
<P>
To use filenames beginning with a dash (<B>-</B>) wihtout having the system
interpret the filenames as command parameters, use either the absolute path
or a relative path in your command.
<P>
Example:
<PRE> 
  attrib -r .\-test.log

  attrib -r c:\temp\-test.log
</PRE>

<P>
 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Users of alternate command shells such as 4OS2 should check
to see what char their command interpreter is using as the escape char (CMD.EXE
uses "^") before using the caret symbol.  Some command interpreters allow
the user to change the character used.  This is usually controlled by a
setting in an INI file or environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
