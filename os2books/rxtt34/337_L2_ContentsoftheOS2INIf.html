<H1>Contents of the OS/2 INI files</H1><!-- entering slot 349 -->
<P>
OS/2 saves a big part of its configuration in the files <A HREF="339_L3_OS2INI.html">OS2.INI
</A>and <A HREF="358_L3_OS2SYSINI.html">OS2SYS.INI</A>. Therefore, many
of the changes you might make to the WPS with REXX will involve changing
some entries in these INI files.
<P>
The basic structure of OS/2 INI files is hierarchical, consisting of the
following elements and order:
<PRE> 
  Application
              Key
                  Value
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
Applications are the main entries. Each application must have at least one
Key, and each Key must have a Value (Note that a lot of Values - but not
all - include a trailing NULL byte ['00'x]). This byte may be needed for
certain values to function properly. It should not be discarded when values
are modified.)
<P>
To read or change INI file entries in REXX programs you can use the REXXUTIL
function SysIni</A>. For example, to read the value of the key<B> PDR_DIR
</B>of the application<B> PM_INSTALL</B> in the file OS2.INI you can use
the REXX statement
<PRE> 
   pdr_dir = SysIni( 'USER', 'PM_INSTALL', 'PDR_DIR' )
   if pdr_dir = 'ERROR:' then
      say 'Error reading the key from the INI file!'
</PRE>

<P>
To change the value of this key you can use
<PRE> 
   newPDR_DIR = 'I:\OS2IMAGE' || '00'x
   thisRC = SysIni( 'USER', 'PM_INSTALL', 'PDR_DIR', newPDR_DIR )
   if thisRC = 'ERROR:' then
      say 'Error reading the key from the INI file!'
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
(BTW: The key used in the example above holds the name of the directory
with the OS/2 image files (I:\OS2IMAGE) from which the system was installed.
The value of this key is also the default value for the directory containing
the OS/2 image if you do a Selective Install. The drive letter represents
the drive that was used when the system was installed; therefore it can
differ from one installation to another)
<P>
A detailed description of the contents of the OS/2 INI files (including
many REXX samples to change the entries) is included in the book <A HREF="632_L3_OS2211PowerTechnique.html">OS/2
2.11 Power Techniques</A>. (Don't mind the version 2.11 in the title - the
book is also useful for WARP 4).
<P>
Some useful entries are described in the next sections.
<P>
Note that, unless noted otherwise, all entries below have been tested only
with OS/2 WARP Version 3.
<P>
You can use the program <A HREF="552_L3_ConvIniCMD.html">ConvIni.CMD</A> to
convert parts or all of an INI file into a REXX program to recreate the
INI file entries.
