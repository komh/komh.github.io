Description from the author:
<P>
"MAKEREXX is a utility that allows a REXX programmer to create a library
of generic routines.  Those routines are maintained in a subdirectory named
'XXX' and must have a file suffix of '.XXX'.  The REXX code produced by
MAKEREXX is placed in a subdirectory of '.CMD' and will have a suffix of
either '.CMD' or '.ERX'.  '.CMD' files are OS/2 REXX routines while the
'.ERX' files are EPM editor REXX routines.  Mainline REXX routines are maintained
in a subdirectory named 'REX' and must have a file suffix of either '.REX'
or '.EPM'.  '.REX' routines will be expanded into '.CMD' routines while
'.EPM' routines will be expanded into '.ERX' routines."
