<H1>Hints for some DOS commands</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
This section contains hints and undocumented information about some DOS
commands under OS/2. Note that the information provided here is. as far
as I know, only true for the DOS included in OS/2 WARP.
<P>
Further note that information about the external family mode commands (these
are external commands usable in DOS and OS/2 sessions) are included in the
section <A HREF="120_L2_HintsforsomeOS2comma.html">Hints for some OS/2 commands</A>.

<P>
If you're looking for more DOS secrets you may take a look at the website
<B>http://members.aol.com/axcel216/secrets.htm</B> .
<P>
Please be aware, that I do not know if the tips mentioned there are working
in the DOS box of OS/2 also.
<P>
Thanks to Michael Lueck (see <A HREF="954_L2H_EMailaddressesL.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) for this information.
