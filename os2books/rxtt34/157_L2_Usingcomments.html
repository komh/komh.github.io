<P>
Although it's possible to use multi-line comments in REXX programs, it's
not advisable. Multi-line comments can make it very difficult to search
an error in REXX programs. 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Because nested comments are allowed in REXX, you should use
the following technique to use the strings to mark the beginning and the
end of a comment in a string:
<BR>
<B>"/" || "*"</B>
<BR>
and
<BR>
<B>"*" || "/"</B>
<BR>
