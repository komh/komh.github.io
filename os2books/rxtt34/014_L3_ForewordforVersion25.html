Unfortunately, IBM decided to close the OS/2 Developer Forum 1 on CompuServe
in January 1997. Therefore, this forum is not an official release point
for RXT&amp;T anymore.
<BR>
But there's now a new OS/2 related forum on CompuServe called OS/2 Central.
This forum is not associated with IBM and thus is independent from any of
the decisions IBM will make in the future (well, mostly independent :-)
)
<P>
So, the REXX section of OS/2 Central is now the official release point for
RXT&amp;T on CompuServe. And, as time goes by, I'll try to upload mostly
all software mentioned in RXT&amp;T to the library of this forum.
<P>
I invite all OS/2 Users to visit the OS/2 Central.

The fourth Edition of Dick Goran's excellent <A HREF="600_L3_REXXReferenceSummary.html">REXX
Reference Summary Handbook</A> is out!
<P>
This book is a<B> must have</B> for every serious REXX programmer doing
WPS related programs in REXX!

Digging around with OS/2 REXX I've found some further features I did not
know before regarding the use of the parameter placeholder %0 to %9 in REXX
programs. Take a look at the sections <A HREF="493_L3_Gettheinvocationsynt.html">Get
the invocation syntax</A>, <A HREF="494_L3_GetthenameoftheMAINR.html">Get
the name of the MAIN REXX program called</A>, and <A HREF="495_L3_Gettheparametersasse.html">Get
the parameters as seen by CMD.EXE</A> to see what you can do with this feature.

Also new in this release is a section with <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Hints
for Object REXX</A>. At this time, this section only contains hints on using
Classic REXX programs under Object REXX. But I plan to add further information
about the Object-Oriented features of Object REXX as soon as I've time.
