<H1>The SET command</H1><!-- entering slot 136 -->
<P>
It is tricky, if not impossible, to use the character<B> =</B> in environment
variables used with the SET</A> command. For example the command
<PRE> 
  SET test=myVar=myValue
</PRE>

<P>
leads to the OS/2 error SYS1003</A>.
<BR>
To get around this limitation, surround the value with double quotes:
<PRE> 
  SET test="myVar=myValue"
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
Or you can set the environment variable in the CONFIG.SYS. SET statements
in the file CONFIG.SYS don't have this limitation (except that you cannot
use the equal char in the name of an environment variable).
<P>
But be aware that you cannot use nested environment variables in the CONFIG.SYS.
Example:
<PRE> 
   REM *** Example SET statements for
   REM     the CONFIG.SYS
   REM
   SET varA=ValueA

   REM *** The next statement does not
   REM     work as expected if used
   REM     in the CONFIG.SYS!
   REM
   SET varB=%varA% ValueB

   REM *** The next statement will
   REM     only work in the CONFIG.SYS
   REM
   REM ---name----  ----Value----
   SET configEnvVar=myVar=myValue
</PRE>

<P>
By the way: The characters |, &lt; and &gt; don't have a special meaning
if used in commands in the CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
In any case, in REXX programs you should use the REXX function VALUE</A> to
get or set the value of environment variables. The function VALUE does not
have this limitation.
