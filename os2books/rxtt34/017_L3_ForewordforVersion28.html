This version of REXX Tips &amp; Tricks (except this foreword) was again
edited by Dave Hicks (see <A HREF="950_L2H_EMailaddressesH.html">EMail Addresses</A>)
for proper, correct English. He also rewrote some sections to improve and
clarify the text.
<P>
Many thanks to Dave for his great work!

One highlight of the last months is the release of <A HREF="272_L2_ObjectREXXforLinux.html">Object
REXX for Linux</A>. It's available on the web (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>) and it's free. And there is also a beta version of <A HREF="273_L2_ObjectREXXforAIX.html">Object
REXX for AIX</A> available. Hopefully there will be further versions of
Object REXX for other Unix operating systems in the future.
<BR>
Note that you should download <A HREF="272_L2_ObjectREXXforLinux.html">Object
REXX for Linux</A> (even if you don't have Linux running) because of the
documentation in Postscript format contained in the archive.
<P>
Note further that as of 03/12/98 there is already an updated and bug fixed
version of <A HREF="272_L2_ObjectREXXforLinux.html">Object REXX for Linux
</A>available.

There is now another update for Object REXX for OS/2 on the web (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>) - and even the version from WARP 4 Fixpack #6 is out of
date. Therefore I strongly recommend you try the version from the Web instead
of the version that is part of WARP 4.
<P>
I also encourage every one to use Object REXX instead of Classic REXX in
OS/2 even if you only program in Classic REXX style. Ammong others, the
main reason for this is the better syntax checking of the Object REXX interpreter.
I, for example, use Object REXX also to syntax-check my REXX programs for
AIX and TSO.

I've finally found an official distribution point for <A HREF="670_L3_DrDialogvisualREXXpr.html">DrDialog</A>:
Every one can download it from the IBM Developer Connection WEB page (see
<A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet - Web Pages</A>).

There were some subtle bugs in the sort routines: Mostly all of the sort
routines in RXT&amp;T used normal comparision - not strict comparision.
Therefore, the routines produced a wrong result if the data to sort contained
leading or trailing blanks. I've fixed these bugs in this version.
<P>
Many thanks to Arthur Pool (see <A HREF="958_L2H_EMailaddressesP.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) for the report about these bugs (including the corrected
versions)!

The latest FixPaks for OS/2 Warp 3 (FP35 and above) and Warp 4 (FP6 and
above) contain extensions for REXX to make it "Y2K Tolerant" (see <A HREF="155_L2_REXXandY2K.html">REXX
and Y2K</A>).

Some interesting new REXX code in this version is in the sections <A HREF="515_L3_Sampleforpersistentv.html">Sample
for persistent variables</A> and <A HREF="374_L3_GettheobjectIDforano.html">Get
the object ID for an object handle</A>.
