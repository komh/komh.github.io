<P>
To extract the included source code you can use the menu entry<B> Services/Copy
to file</B> while RXT&amp;T is being displayed by the view program and the
source code is the active window. The view program then creates a file named
<B>TEXT.TMP</B> in the current directory. If you selected the correct window
to copy, the TEXT.TMP file will contain the source code that is displayed
in RXT&amp;T.
<BR>
After that double click on to start the OS/2 editor and load<B> TEXT.TMP</B>.

<BR>
Insert the necessary REXX comment marks beginning in the first column of
the first line of the file and save it with a descriptive filename and the
extension<B> .CMD.</B> (e.g., you might use a name like<B> FILTER.CMD</B> if
you save the REXX code in the chapter <A HREF="159_L2_Writingfilterprogram.html">
Writing filter programs in REXX</A>). At that point, you can double click
on the file to start a CMD window to test the REXX program. Another method
is to invoke the REXX program from the OS/2 command line by typing its name,
any necessary parameters, and pressing the ENTER key (Double click on to
start a CMD window to test the REXX program right now).
<BR>
You can also just double click on to start the REXX program REXXTRY.CMD
to do some testing. Or double click on to start REXXTRY using PMREXX. (see
also <A HREF="903_L2_ExtendtheprogramREXX.html">Extend the program REXXTRY</A>)
 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> By using a special environment variable, IPF_KEYS (see <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using
IPF Keys</A>), you can have a small window containing the icons mentioned
above always open. This window gives you quick access to the editor, command
window, REXXTRY, PMREXX, and information on how to use them with the sample
code in RXT&amp;T. Alternatively, you can display this window by clicking
on the icon <A AUTO VIEWPORT DEPENDENT GROUP=4100 HREF="107_L4_Menu.html">[Autolink] Menu</A><P><!-- extra bytes: 4C 06 04 10 04 00 -->
<P>
 in the window with the source code.
<P>
See the section <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using IPF Keys</A> for
information on automatically opening the window (also called the "codemenu")
whenever you view source code samples in RXT&amp;T. Also, see the section
<A HREF="110_L3_IconsUsedinREXXTips&.html">Icons Used in REXX Tips &amp;
