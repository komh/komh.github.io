<H1>Message from Charles Daney about The REXX Cookbook</H1><!-- entering slot 665 -->
<P>
I just scanned an advance copy of a new book on OS/2 REXX, called<B> The
REXX Cookbook</B>, by Merrill Callaway. He's publishing it himself, and
I have also uploaded a file (RXCKBK.TXT) to library 6, (CompuServe-Forum
OS2DF1) which contains a press release and overview of the book.
<BR>
I found this a very interesting book that OS/2 users of REXX might want
to consider. Although it starts off assuming little background in programming,
it covers a lot of the REXX language. Though it is not without some small
errors, Callaway has put in an impressive amount of work on this book. It's
one of the most detailed computer books I've ever seen, and not just trivial
detail either, but good solid information. And some of the examples are
among the best I've seen anywhere.
<BR>
Though I didn't really look at it as a tool for actually learning programming,
it does have introductory chapters. But it also has entire chapters devoted
to topics like debugging, REXX as a macro language, interprocess communication
(including a lot about SQL and DB2/2), VX-REXX, and the use of PostScript
from REXX. I have no financial or other connection with this book - just
thought that OS/2 users interested in REXX should look into this, since
it is very different from the usual dry, boring computer manual and has
a high content of real meat.
