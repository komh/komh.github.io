<P>
Well, here it is: The first English release of REXX Tips &amp; Tricks. It's
taken some time for me to translate it but now it's done.
<P>
Because English is not my native language, there may be many errors and
misspellings in this document. Nevertheless I hope you'll understand it
anyway.
<P>
To make this document more readable and useful for all readers I ask all
English-speaking people to tell me their opinions about this document. Especially,
I'm interested in hearing about errors, misspellings, grammatical nonsense
and such things.
<P>
Thanks in advance
<P>
Bernd Schemmer, Frankfurt in April 1995 (corrected spelling errors in July
1995)
