<P>
This section contains the documentation for the new functions in the REXXUTIL.DLL
from <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented REXX</A> from
18 May 1999 (The documentation is missing in the file REXX.INF).
<PRE> 

 SysDumpVariables
 ----------------

 Syntax:    result = SysDumpVariables([filename])

 Params:    filename - name of the file where variables are appended to
                       (dump is written to STDOUT if omitted)

 Function:  This function dumps all variables in the current scope either
            to the specified file (new data will be appended) or to STDOUT
            if the filename parameter is omitted. The format of the data
            is (one variable per line):
                 Name=MYVAR, Value="This is the content of MYVAR"

            Examples:
               Call SysDumpVariables "MyVars.Lst" /* append vars to file */
               Call SysDumpVariables              /* list vars on STDOUT */

 Return:    0 - dump completed OK
            -1 - failure during dump



 SysSetFileDateTime
 ------------------

 Syntax:    result = SysSetFileDateTime(filename [,newdate] [,newtime])

 Params:    filename - name of the file to update
            newdate  - new date to set in format YYYY-MM-DD
               OS/2: (YYYY &gt; 1980)
               Win: (YYYY &gt; 1800)
               AIX/Linux: (YYYY &gt; 1900)
            newtime  - new time to set in format HH:MM:SS (24 hr format)

 Function:  This function can be used to modify the "Last Modified"
            Date of the specified file. If no new date or new time is
            specified then the file date and time will be set to the
            current time (TOUCH). If only one of date or time is omitted
            then this parameter will be left unchanged.

            For OS/2 and Windows NT the filename may also specify a directory
            name. This does not work with Windows 95/98 or AIX/Linux however.

            The file you want to change must not be opened by another process
            or at least it must allow shared writes in order to update the
            timestamp.

            Examples:
               Call SysSetFileDateTime "MyFile.Log"  /* touch file */
               Call SysSetFileDateTime "MyFile.Log", "1998-12-17"
               Call SysSetFileDateTime "MyFile.Log",, "16:37:21"
               Call SysSetFileDateTime "MyFile.Log", "1998-12-17", "16:37:21"

               Call SysSetFileDateTime "C:\MyDir"    /* touch dir on OS/2, NT */

 Return:    0 - file date/time was updated correctly
            -1 - failure attribute update



 SysGetFileDateTime
 ------------------

 Syntax:    result = SysGetFileDateTime(filename [,timesel])

 Params:    filename - name of the file to query
            timesel  - What filetime to query: CREATE/ACCESS/WRITE

 Function:  The function call returns the selected file date time attribute
            of the specified file if this is supported by the operating
            and file system (e.g. FAT does not provide Create/Access). The
            selector for the time to be returned can be abbreviated with
            its first character.

            For OS/2 and Windows NT the filename may also specify a directory
            name. This does not work with Windows 95/98 or AIX/Linux however.

            The file you want to query must not be opened by another process
            or at least it must allow shared reads in order to query the
            timestamp.

            Examples:
               Say "File creation time:" SysGetFileDateTime("MyFile.Log", "C")
               Say "File last access time:" SysGetFileDateTime("MyFile.Log", "A")
               Say "File last update time:" SysGetFileDateTime("MyFile.Log", "W")

               Say "Directory creation time:" SysGetFileDateTime("C:\MyDir", "C")

 Return:    -1 - file date/time query failed
            other - date and time as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS



 SysStemCopy
 -----------

 Syntax:    result = SysStemCopy(fromstem, tostem, [from], [to], [count] [,insert])

 Params:    fromstem - name of source stem
            tostem - - name of target stem
            from  - first index in source stem to copy
            to - position where items are copied/inserted in target stem
            count - number of items to copy/insert
            insert - 'I' to indicate insert instead of 'O' overwrite

 Function:  Copy elements from the source stem to the target stem. Elements
            in the source stem are copied starting at the from index (<!-- entering slot 339 -->default 1)
            into the target stem beginning at the to index (default 1). The number
            of items to copy to the target stem can be specified with count (default
            is to copy all items in the source stem). You can optionally specify that
            the items should be inserted into the target stem at the position and the
            existing items will be shifted to the back accordingly.

            This function operates only on stem arrays that specify the number of
            elements in stem.0 and all elements must be numbered from 1 to n with
            no omitted index.

            Examples:
               Source.0 = 3
               Source.1 = "Hello"
               Source.2 = "from"
               Source.3 = "REXX"
               Call SysStemCopy "Source.", "Target."

               Call SysStemCopy "Source.", "Target.", 1, 5, 2, "I"

 Return:    0 - stem copy was successful
            -1 - stem copy failed



 SysStemDelete
 -------------

 Syntax:    result = SysStemDelete(stem, startitem [,itemcount])

 Params:    stem - name of stem where item will be deleted
            startitem - index of item to delete
            itemcount - number of items to delete if more than 1

 Function:  Deletes the specified item at index startitem in the stem.
            If more than one item is to be deleted then the count of
            items can be specified as the third parameter. After deleting
            the requested items the stem will be compacted, that means
            items following the deleted items will be shifted up into the
            vacant positions.

            This function operates only on stem arrays that specify the number of
            elements in stem.0 and all elements must be numbered from 1 to n with
            no omitted index.

            Examples:

               Call SysStemDelete "MyStem.", 5

               Call SysStemDelete "MyStem.", 5, 4

 Return:    0 - delete was successful
            -1 - delete failed



 SysStemInsert
 -------------

 Syntax:    result = SysStemInsert(stem, position, value)

 Params:    stem - name of stem where item will be inserted
            position - index where new item will be inserted
            value - new item value

 Function:  A new item will be inserted at the specified position in
            the stem. All existing items in the stem from the specified
            position will be shifted up by one to make room for the new
            item.

            This function operates only on stem arrays that specify the number of
            elements in stem.0 and all elements must be numbered from 1 to n with
            no omitted index.

            Example:
               Call SysStemInsert "MyStem.", 5, "New value for item 5"

 Return:    0 - insert was successful
            -1 - insert failed



 SysStemSort
 -----------

 Syntax:    result = SysStemSort(stem, order, type, start, end,
                                 firstcol, lastcol)

 Params:    stem - name of stem to sort
            order - 'A' or 'D' for sort order (default: ascending)
            type - 'C', 'I'  for comparision type (case/ignore, default: case)
            start - first index to sort (default: 1)
            end - last index to sort (default: last item)
            firstcol - first column to use as sort key (default: 1)
            lastcol - last column to use as sort key (default: last column)

 Function:  This call sorts all or the specified items in the stem.
            Sort order can be specified as ascending or descending, comparison
            type can respect or ignore the case of the strings being compared.
            The sorting can further be narrowed by specifying the first and last
            item to be sorted or by specifying the columns used as the sorting
            key. The sort uses a quicksort algorithm, so the order of equal
            elements according to the sort key is undetermined.

            This function operates only on stem arrays that specify the number of
            elements in stem.0 and all elements must be numbered from 1 to n with
            no omitted index.

            Examples:
               /* sort all elements descending, use cols 5 to 10 as key */
               Call SysStemSort "MyStem.", "D",,,,5, 10

               /* sort all elements ascending, ignore the case */
               Call SysStemSort "MyStem.", "A", "I"

               /* sort elements 10 to 20 ascending, use cols 1 to 10 as key */
               Call SysStemSort "MyStem.",,,10, 20, 1, 10

 Return:    0 - sort was successful
            -1 - sort failed


 SysVersion
 ----------

 Syntax:    result = SysVersion()

 Params:    None

 Function:  This function returns a string to identify the operating system
            and its version. The returned string contains an identifier for
            the operating system as the first word and then the version in
            the second word.

            Examples:
               Say SysVersion()       /* show OS and version */

 Return:    Operating system and version

            Possible output for operating systems supported by Object REXX:

               Say SysVersion()   -&gt;  "WindowsNT 4.00"
               Say SysVersion()   -&gt;  "OS/2 2.40"
               Say SysVersion()   -&gt;  "AIX 4.2"
               Say SysVersion()   -&gt;  "Linux 2.0.34"

 Note:      This function can be used to replace the operating system specific
            functions SysOS2Ver(), SysWinVer(), and SysLinVer().


 SysUtilVersion
 --------------

 Syntax:    result = SysUtilVersion()

 Params:    None

 Function:  This function returns a version number that identifies the current
            level of the REXX Utilities package. This can be used to verify
            that certain functions are available.

            Examples:

            Since this function was not part of the original packaging a
            sample logic to check for a certain level of REXXUTIL could look
            like this:

               If RxFuncQuery("SysUtilVersion") = 1 |,
                  SysUtilVersion() &lt; "2.00" Then
                    Say "<!-- entering slot 340 -->Your REXXUTIL.DLL is not at the current level"

            If a specific function should be used that was added at a later
            REXXUTIL level a similar check can be performed by querying that
            function:

               If RxFuncQuery("SysSetFileDateTime") = 1 Then
                 Say "Your REXXUTIL.DLL is not at the current level"

 Return:    REXXUTIL version number in the format (n.mm)
