<P>
DrDialog is a very good tool to develop PM applications in REXX. You can
use DrDialog to develop event driven REXX programs with PM GUI.
<P>
You can download DrDialog from the IBM Developer Connection Web page (see
<A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet - Web Pages</A>). You've to register
for guest access to do it, but don't worry - it's free.
<P>

<P>
<B>Warning: </B> There seems to be problems using an older version of DrDialog
or programs created with an older version of DrDialog under OS/2 WARP 4!

<B>Note (02/12/2001):</B>
<P>
There are two zip files called<B> DrDlgFix.zip</B> and<B> DrDlgRc.zip</B> on
hobbes (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet - Web Pages</A>)
that claim to fix the problems with <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented
REXX</A>. From an article in<B> OS/2 eZine</B>:
<P>
"If you are using DrDialog with Object Rexx you will need DrDlgFix.zip which
corrects a problem with the DrsAide tool and Object Rexx.
<P>
You will need to obtain an old version of the resource compiler to use the
ResToRexx tool. Try DrDlgRc.ZIP on Hobbes, OS2BBS and LEO."
<P>
RXTT320 01/07/11: Note that there is a new version of DrDlgRC.ZIP that adds
a file missing in the previous zip file!
<P>
I did not test them so I can not say if this is true or not. You might ask
the user who uploaded the file to hobbes, D Clark<B> dgclark@attglobal.net
</B>.

<P>
"There is a problem running DrDialog programs under Object REXX if they
use DrsAide (as shipped) controls.  Because Object REXX parses the entire
file before running, many times syntax errors which would go undetected
under "Classic" REXX are in fact detected.  There is just such a syntax
error in the DrsAide utility.
<P>
To fix the problem, open the DRSAIDE.RES file from the DrDialog File Menu
option.  Double-Click the ICONBUTTON (the only control visible other than
the DIALOG).  The DrRexx Code editor should appear with the ICONBUTTON section
open.  Click the "Drop-" tab and use the spin-button under the edit window
to bring up the Class code.  At the very end, on its own line, type END.
 Save the file.  And now everything should work."
