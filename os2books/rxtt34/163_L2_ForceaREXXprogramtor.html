<H1>Force a REXX program to run in a special way</H1><!-- entering slot 165 -->
<P>
Sometimes it is important for a REXX program to run within a specific environment
(e.g. <A HREF="889_L2_UsingPMREXX.html">PMREXX</A>) or in a special way
(e.g. minimized or in the background).
<P>
To ensure that your REXX program uses the environment you intend it to use,
you can check the current environment in your REXX program and, if it's
not the envionment you need, restart the REXX program in the needed environment:

<P>
In the first case mentioned above, you can use the return code of the function
ADDRESS</A> to check the current environment (see <A HREF="164_L3_RunaREXXprogramunder.html">Run
a REXX program under a specific environment</A> and the warning regarding
WARP 4 in the section <A HREF="889_L2_UsingPMREXX.html">PMREXX</A>!); in
the second case (i.e., running your program in a special way, such as minimized),
you cannot detect the current environment and thus you've to restart your
program using an additional parameter to distinguish between the two passes.
(see <A HREF="165_L3_ForceaREXXprogramtor.html">Force a REXX program to
run minimized</A>).
