Introduction

NetRexx   is   a   new   programming   language   derived   from   both   Rexx   and
Java ( tm ) ;   the   rules   of   syntax   closely   follow   those   of   Rexx ,   while   the
semantics   often   follow   Java .    It   is   intended   as   a   dialect   of   Rexx   that
can   be   as   efficient   and   portable   as   Java ,   while   preserving   the   low
threshold   to   learning   of   the   original   Rexx   language .    Further ,   the
language   is   intended   to   be   even   more   keyword   safe   than   Rexx :   it   should
be   possible   to   re - compile   or   execute   an   existing   NetRexx   program   _ from
source _   at   any   time   without   additions   to   the   keywords   known   to   the
language   invalidating   an   existing   program .

Like   Rexx ,   NetRexx   is   designed   to   allow   clear   separation   of   its   concepts ,
so   it   may   be   introduced   gradually .    Also   like   Rexx ,   sensible   defaults
are   defined   to   aid   ease   of   use   - -   especially   for   the   novice   programmer .
These   defaults   can   be   turned   off   for   the   programmer   who   needs   stricter
type - checking   and   certain   other   features .

The   Java   virtual   machine   environment   is   assumed   to   be   a   platform   for
NetRexx ,   and   this   places   some   constraints   on   the   NetRexx   language .    For
example ,   the   semantics   of   type   resolution   are   in   part   determined   by   the
environment ,   not   the   language .

The   constraints   of   efficiency ,   safety ,   and   environment   implied   that   this
language   would   have   to   differ   in   some   details   of   syntax   and   semantics
from   Rexx ;   it   could   not   be   a   fully   upwards - compatible   extension   to   Rexx .
The   need   for   change ,   however ,   has   offered   the   opportunity   to   make   some
simplifications   and   enhancements   to   the   language   to   strengthen
the   original   Rexx   design ,   and   incorporate   other   additions   from   ANSI   Rexx
and   Object   Rexx .
