Description from the author:
<P>
"Abstract Introduction
<P>
RxSwitchQuery (RxIsRun.DLL) is a small OS/2 Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that
interfaces routines for querying the OS/2 system WinSwitchList with REXX.

<P>
Querying the WinSwitchList allows you to check if a certain program (OS/2,
DOS or Windoze) is running. RxSwitchQuery also allows you to wait for a
given application to appear in the WinSwitchList, or for an application
to disappear; this is useful in situations where scripts have to be synchronised
with running programs.
<P>
These functions cannot be made from standard REXX, and resorting to tape-and-glue
solutions of repeatedly calling external query programs is a very slow and
computionally intensive task. With this easy-to-use and versatile DLL, you
can easily and efficiently check for running OS/2, DOS or Windoze programs
from your standard REXX programs."
