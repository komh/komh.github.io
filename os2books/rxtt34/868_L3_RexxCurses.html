Description from the author:
<P>
"Rexx/Curses is an external function package for most Rexx interpreters
that provides a portable text based user interface for Rexx programs.  The
underlying portable text based user interface is "curses".
<P>
The design of Rexx/Curses follows the C API for Curses as closely as possible.

<P>
Rexx/Curses should work on any system that has a curses library available
and a Rexx interpreter that supports the REXX SAA API. This covers most
Un*x platforms and DOS, OS/2 and Win32.
<P>
The recommended curses library for use on Un*x platforms is ncurses, while
for DOS, OS/2 and Win32, PDCurses is the curses library required.  It is
possible to build native X11 applications with Rexx/Curses and PDCurses
on Un*x platforms.
<P>
Enjoy, Mark."
