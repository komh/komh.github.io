<H1>New REXXUTIL functions in WARP</H1><!-- entering slot 334 -->
<P>
There are 5 new functions in OS/2 WARP Version 3 to work on WPS objects:

for these functions is really a pit, I include the documentation from the
<A HREF="600_L3_REXXReferenceSummary.html">REXX Reference Summary Handbook
</A>by<B> Dick Goran</B> (see <A HREF="949_L2H_EMailaddressesG.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) (captured from a message in a public CompuServe Forum):
<PRE> 
The following new functions have been added to REXXUTIL in WARP
Version 3.0:

SysCopyObject( object_name, object_destination )
     Returns 1 if object_name was successfully copied to
     object_destination; otherwise, returns 0. If the object
     already exists in the destination location, it is not copied
     and a 0 is returned.

     Both object_name and object_destination can be a WPS
     object ID (the unique string preceded with a '&lt;' and
     terminated with a '&gt;') assigned to the object when it was
     created (e.g. &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;) or a fully qualified file
     name. The predefined object IDs are shown in Section
     4.1 beginning on page 89.

     Note 01: The copied object will not have an OBJECTID
              whether the original object had one assigned or
              not.

     Note 02: Some of the object's other properties are not
              copied along with the object. Specifically,
              ASSOCTYPE= belonging to the original object
              does not appear on the copy. This is consistent
              with what occurs when using drag &amp; drop to copy

SysCreateShadow( object_name, object_destination )

     Returns 1 if a shadow of object_name was successfully
     created at the specified location, object_destination;
     otherwise, returns 0.

     Both object_name and object_destination can be a WPS
     object ID (the unique string preceded with a '&lt;' and
     terminated with a '&gt;') assigned to the object when it was
     created (e.g. &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;) or a fully qualified file
     name. The predefined object IDs are shown in Section
     4.1 beginning on page 89.

SysMoveObject( object_name, object_destination )
     Returns 1 if object_name was successfully moved to
     object_destination; otherwise, returns 0. If the object
     already exists in the destination location, it is not moved
     and a 0 is returned.

     Both object_name and object_destination can be a WPS
     object ID (the unique string preceded with a '&lt;' and
     terminated with a '&gt;') assigned to the object when it was
     created (e.g. &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;) or a fully qualified file
     name. The predefined object IDs are shown in Section
     4.1 beginning on page 89.

SysOpenObject( object_name, view, flag )
     Returns 1 if the WPS object object_name was
     successfully opened on the Desktop; otherwise, returns
     0.

     Object_name can be a WPS object ID (the unique string
     preceded with a '&lt;' and terminated with a '&gt;') assigned
     to the object when it was created (e.g.
     &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;) or a fully qualified file name. The
     predefined object IDs are shown in Section 4.1 beginning
     on page 89.

     View specifies the view to be opened and can contain
     either a numeric value or the equivalent string. The
     function will pass all numeric values to the underlying
     wpOpen() or wpViewObject() function without testing
     the value for validity.

            0 - DEFAULT
            1 - ICON
            2 - SETTINGS
            3 - HELP
            4 - RUNNING
            5 - PROMPTDLG

          101 - Tree view        (added RXT&amp;T v2.00 /bs)
          102 - details view     (added RXT&amp;T v2.00 /bs)

          121 - PALETTE


     Flag can contain a 1 indicating that an existing view of
     an object can be opened on top of the Desktop
     (resurfaced) by calling the wpViewObject method or a
     0 indicating that the view specified in view is to be
     opened using the wpOpen method. The following
     comment originated in the description of the wpOpen
     method:

     "In general, wpViewObject should be used instead of the
     wpOpen method. This is because wpViewObject takes into
     consideration the setting in the Object Open Behavior field
     on the Window page of the Settings notebook for the object.
     If a view of the object is already open, wpViewObject will
     depending on the setting of the Object Open Behavior field,
     either display the existing window for the object or create a
     new object."

     "In contrast, wpOpen always opens a new view of the
     object. Under certain circumstances this might be called
     for, but, under most circumstances, wpViewObject should
     be called instead."

SysSaveObject( object_name, timing_flag )
     Returns 1 if the WPS object object_name was
     successfully saved; otherwise, returns 0. <!-- entering slot 335 -->File system
     objects (WPFileSystem) are saved in the file system's
     extended attributes and abstract objects are saved in the
     OS2.INI (user) file. Transient objects (WPTransient)
     cannot be saved.

     Object_name can be a WPS object ID (the unique string
     preceded with a '&lt;' and terminated with a '&gt;') assigned
     to the object when it was created (e.g.
     &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;) or a fully qualified file name. The
     predefined object IDs are shown in Section 4.1 beginning
     on page 89.

     Timing_flag can be 0 (Boolean false - object is to be
     saved synchronously) or 1 (Boolean true - object is to
     saved asynchronously).
