Description from the author:
<P>
"I've been very surprised when I've found that the OS/2 version of the world's
best known spreadsheet Lotus 123 does not allow to use REXX as a scripting
language. So, 'cause one our client will have a need to use Lotus 123G in
the client server environment to process some data from the object database
having no Datalence drivers for it. So, we have got to write some Lotus
123G interface for this database. We have known that the above object database
will have an ObjectREXX interface (more exactly SOM interface ;-). Therefore,
we have decided to build SOM interface classes for Lotus 123G. The interfaces
of this classes are included in this package. They could be directly used
from ObjectREXX programs. But some testing shows us that the current beta
of ObjectREXX could not be generally used as a macro language for 123G.
The loading time of the ObjectREXX interpreter on the 486DX2 machine with
8M RAM is not, imho, suitable for this purpose. Therefore, the decision
to build the API for an ordinary REXX has been made."
