<H1>Assigning more than one object ID to an object</H1><!-- entering slot 385 -->
<P>
At this time, you can assign more than one object ID to a WPS object. To
do this, create an object with a new object ID. After that assign one or
more new object IDs to the object using SysSetObjectData</A>. Now you can
use the original object ID or one of the new object IDs to refer to the
object.
<P>
The explanation for this from Greg Czaja (see <A HREF="945_L2H_EMailaddressesC.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) is:
<P>
"What really happening is that WPS will assign a new ID (and it will be
stored in the object's properties but the old one will NOT be removed from
OS2.INI -&gt; PM_Workplace:Location. This allows you to refer to an object
using both - the old and the ID's. At least from a REXX or PM program -
WPS will use only the new one."
