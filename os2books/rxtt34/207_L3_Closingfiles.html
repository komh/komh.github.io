<H1>Closing files</H1><!-- entering slot 206 -->
<P>
Because the number of possible file handles is restricted in OS/2 sessions,
you should always close every file you've opened as soon as possible. You
also need to close a file (and perhaps reopen it again) if you want to call
another program to write into or read from this file.
<P>
You should only use
<PRE> 
  rc = STREAM</A>( filename , "c", "CLOSE" )
</PRE>

<P>
to close a file. The other method that is sometimes used, using LINEOUT
</A>or CHAROUT</A> without the second parameter, is only valid for files
to which you have<B> write</B> access (even if you've only read from the
file) <A HREF="1041_L0_.html">(?)</A>.
