<H1>Differences between Classic REXX and Object REXX</H1><!-- entering slot 282 -->
<P>
Normally, all REXX programs written in Classic REXX should run under Object
REXX without any changes. But there are some minor changes and bugs in Object
REXX that might lead to an error in your Classic REXX programs.
<P>
The first thing you should do, if you're got an error in a Classic REXX
program running under Object REXX, is:
<P>
<B>Look in the Object REXX online documentation</A>; especially read the
section Migration</A> (the good old RTFM)!</B>
<P>
If you do not not find anything related to the error there, you can take
a look at the following sections with differences between Classic REXX and
<A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented REXX</A>!
<P>
Please use only this order for checking for problems, because I'm not going
to repeat the facts already mentioned in the Object REXX online documentation</A>.

<P>
OK, now that it's hopefully clear what information you can find in this
section, let's begin.
