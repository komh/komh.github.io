"High-level, easy-to-use, REXX mouse functions with usage example. No doc's"

<P>
Usenet message from the author:
<P>
"M contains several high-level mouse functions. It supports about everything
I could think of in every way I could think of, and is rather easy-to-use.
;p. For example, it can return the mouse cursor position. But also just
the line number, return values (the default setting), and it includes some
sound support, time-outs, and all (possible) screensizes. ;p. There's a
(OS) limitation: it requires fullscreen text-mode. And you have to do the
screen-I/O (draw screen, et cetera) yourself. So don't expect functions
like "FileSaveAs()"! Not all functions are tested intensivly too.
<P>
Because it will take a while before the whole manual is completed (C nor
English is my native language) I have already uploaded the runtime  of "M"
to Hobbes (http://hobbes.nmsu.edu), including one example with comments
(select a drive with a key or the mouse). I assume it's somehow usable that
way, but it doesn't use all (89!) available functions. Just ask if you've
a specific need.
<P>
Anyway, I assume a typical REXX application can be based on the included
EXAMPLE.CMD, so one can already use it as from now. The example is more
"difficult" than required but OTOH it can be used by users, and it also
supports the keyboard."
