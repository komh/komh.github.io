<P>
The maximum length for a string constant in OS/2 REXX is 250. To use strings
longer than 250 chars, split them into pieces less than 250 chars and concatenate
them in a variable. (There's no limitation for the length of the contents
of a variable in OS/2 REXX.)
<BR>
Example:
<PRE> 
  myConstant =,
        "This is a really long string constant.                  " || ,
        "Well, because it is to long for a constant in OS/2 REXX " || ,
        "We split it into smaller pieces and concatenate them    " || ,
        "with the operator || to a big string and save the       " || ,
        "result in a variable. This is possible, because there   " || ,
        "is no limit for the length of a variable in REXX.       "
