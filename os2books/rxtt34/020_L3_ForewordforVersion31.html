<H1>Foreword for Version 3.10</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.
<P>
<!--0xfb-->---------- * ----------

<P>
This version is again only a maintenance update - the only real new REXX
code is in the section <A GROUP=2 HREF="491_L3_Callbyvalue.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 04 02 00 -->Call
by value</A>.
<P>
A new feature in this version is:
<P>
You can now call your web browser and your email program from within REXX
Tips &amp; Tricks. For more information about this new feature see <A GROUP=2 HREF="103_L3_InstallingREXXTips&T.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 04 02 00 -->Installing
REXX Tips &amp; Tricks</A> and <A GROUP=2 HREF="110_L3_IconsUsedinREXXTips&.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 04 02 00 -->Icons
Used in REXX Tips &amp; Tricks</A>.
<P>
In this version I restructured the section <A GROUP=2 HREF="634_L1_AdditionalSoftwarefo.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 04 02 00 -->Additional
Software for REXX</A>. I think it is now more useful than before. I also
added a lot of new software that I found on various sources to this section.
If you know other software useful for REXX programmer - please let me know
and I will add them to RXT&amp;T. That's also true for other information
useful for REXX programmer, of course.
<P>
While implementing the new features I realized that there are a lot of old
Compuserve email addresses in the email section. I'm pretty sure that most
of them are not valid anymore. So, if you know the new email addresses of
one or more people mentioned there - please let me know so that I can correct
them.
<P>

<P>
Something I also want to know is if the sections about BBSes are useful
for anyone anymore. These sections are<B> IBM BBS</B>,<B> Canada</B>,<B> Germany</B>,
<B>USA</B>,<B> Other BBS</B>,<B> Germany</B>, and<B> USA</B>,
<P>
I personally use only the internet nowadays. And I did not update these
sections for a long time - I even don't know if the BBS mentioned there
still exist.
<P>
So, if you find these sections still useful please let me know. Otherwise
I'll remove them in the next version of RXT&amp;T.

And last:
<P>
Beginning in January 2001 I'll work as a freelancer. So, if you need support
for OS/2 (Server or Clients), REXX programming, or any flavour of Unix you're
welcome to contact me.
