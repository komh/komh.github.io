<H1>Note about VME</H1><!-- entering slot 973 -->
<P>
"Virtual Mode Extensions is a hardware enhancement Intel added to their
CPUs beginning with the DX2 models. All Pentium processors also come with
this feature. VME is intended to speed up a number of privileged functions
(CPU instructions) for applications running in virtual mode sessions (for
example, DOS and WinOS2 sessions).
<P>
DOS (and Windows) apps running in an OS/2 Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) believe
they "own" the hardware. On occasion these apps will try to do something
to the (virtual) hardware that isn't permitted while a protected mode operating
system such as OS/2 is in control of the real hardware because permitting
such "privileged" operations would negatively impact overall system integrity
and reliability.
<P>
On a non-VME processor attempting such privileged operations would result
in a (hardware generated) program interrupt, and hence an operating system
(in this case, OS/2) interrupt handler to get control. Control would eventually
pass to a routine that would simulate the attempted function. On a VME processor
the function simulation would be carried out by microcode on the processor
itself. This is both transparent (to the operating system and app) and faster,
BUT only if it works&lt;g&gt;.
<P>
Unfortunately there are apparently some conditions that can arise where
this (usually) transparent handling of privileged operations (in effect,
a hardware implemented microcode "assist") can leave the system in an inconsistent
operating state. In this case the operating system will force a TRAP condition
to protect itself (and YOUR data).
<P>
Adding the "VME=NO" line to "CONFIG.SYS" forces all VME "assisted" CPU instructions
to be reflected to, and handled by, the operating system; in other words,
the way it would have worked had the VME feature not have been present.

<P>
"VME=NO" is not a panacea fix for all your DOS/Windows woes. Indeed the
most common symptom of VME related problems is frequent "Trap D" and "Trap
E" errors in DOS and WinOS2 sessions. Therefore, I doubt it will correct
all the problems you've listed, but it MAY provide some relief. Can't hurt
to try.
