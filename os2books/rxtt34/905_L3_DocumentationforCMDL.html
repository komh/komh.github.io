DEFINING EXTENDED KEYS
<BR>
----------------------
<BR>

<BR>
This feature only works if CmdLine is an INTERNAL function.
<BR>

<BR>
Extended keys may be defined by obtaining the code returned as the second

<BR>
key by SysGetKey when that key is pressed.  The program SHOWCODE.CMD is

<BR>
included to demonstrate how to obtain these codes.  Place commands such

<BR>
as:
<BR>

<BR>
history.key.60="go" /* Definition for F2 */
<BR>

<BR>
in your program.  You cannot redefine keys that are already used by
<BR>
CmdLine.
<BR>

<BR>
Extended keys definitions are only available when history is available.
