Description from the author:
<P>
"This is a generic processor (for any text files) with specific support
built in for rexx and html files.
<P>
When used with the "/rexx" switch it will by default remove comments and
pack rexx code and then perform a syntax check.
<P>
You have access to instructions such as #define, #evaluate, #include, #if
and #ifdef.  You can develop macros that take both optional and manditory
parameters and the macros can conditionally generate output.
<P>
The program is extendable through rexx.  Commands such as #if tests can
be very complex, for example it would be relatively simple to compare environment
variables or contents of files etc.
<P>
The html capability of this program is the basis of a series of e-Zine!
articles (3 so far).  Its use for rexx development would have to be at least
as important.  AWE def files are being developed using PPWIZARD macros and
I generate PPWIZARD itself plus the extensive PPWIZARD INF and HTML documentation
using PPWIZARD macros."
