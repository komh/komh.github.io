<H1>Object IDs of Network applications</H1><!-- entering slot 384 -->
<P>
The following text is taken from the readme file from the<B> FIXNETAP.ZIP
</B>package from Phil Dumitru with permission of the author (see <A HREF="946_L2H_EMailaddressesD.html">EMail
Addresses</A>):
<P>
"The object ID of our Network Apps folder is this:
<P>
<B>&lt;\NETAPPS\NETAPPFLDR&gt;</B>
<P>
The object IDs inside the folder are in this format:
<P>
<B>&lt;\Primary Domain Contoller\Application name&gt;</B>
<P>
Example:
<P>
Primary Domain Controller is LSBUF165
<BR>
Application name is TEST123
<P>
object ID for this program object in the Net Apps folder is<B> &lt;\LSBUF165\TEST123&gt;
</B>
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Application name is defined at the top of the Identity page
in the settings notebook for the Public Application definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
Frankly, I don't know what happens if the folder is served up by the Backup
Domain Controller rather than the primary.  Maybe the first part of the
object IDs change to the BDC name?
<P>
Also, note that if you're trying to change settings on a Windows app to
Enhanced mode, this program alone will not do it.  You must also take this
step once (on the server if the .EXE is there), before this program will
work: Drill down to the .EXE file itself using the DRIVES object, open it's
setings notebook, and change the settings on the .EXE to Enhanced mode.
 If you haven't done this, the program object you're trying to manipulate
will automatically be set to Standard mode.  This bug is what drove me to
ask the original question about whether a program could perform the same
function.
<P>
The indispensable IBM Redbook <A HREF="583_L3_IBMOS2REXXFromBarkto.html">IBM
OS/2 REXX From Bark To Byte</A> has a program for listing object IDs (see
page 81.)  On my PC it lists the objects in the Net Apps folder last.  If
you don't have this book, absolutely get it.
<P>
Hope this helps."
