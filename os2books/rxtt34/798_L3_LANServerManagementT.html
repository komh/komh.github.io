Description from the author:
<P>
"The major purpose of the tools is to help the novice as well as the experienced
LAN Server administrator to migrate, update and/or maintain his LAN Server
domain(s).
<P>
The tools allow the administrator to extract the information of his current
LAN Server environment into ASCII files, change it and use it to apply these
changes to the same or to a newly installed environment.
<P>
Therefore these tools are useful to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Backup a LAN Server domain<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restore a backuped version<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Migrate (for example from LAN Server 3.0 to 4.0 or
WarpServer)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Consolidate<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restructure the actual domain definitions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The programs are written in REXX not only to enable you to adjust them to
your own needs but also to demonstrate the usability and easiness of REXX.
We have written the programs to meet following objectives:
<P>
The command files have to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->be easy to read and debug by any user who is familiar
with REXX<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->be easy to upgrade to a PM environment by using programs
such as VX-Rexx, VisPro-Rexx, GPF-Rexx, DrDialog and so on<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->provide external customable files for proper convenience
such as column length, language and so on<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->provide error and logging facilities for all activities
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>"
<P>
This program is mentioned here as<B> very good</B> example for using the
REXX DLLs from LAN Server or WARP Server.
<P>
I used this program in my company to create a backup of the DCDB. And I've
also used it to rebuild a LAN Server Domain from scratch - without any problems!
