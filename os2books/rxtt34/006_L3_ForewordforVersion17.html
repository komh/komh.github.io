<H1>Foreword for Version 1.70</H1><!-- entering slot 6 -->
<P>
This version of REXX Tips &amp; Tricks (to be exact: All sections already
contained in the version 1.60) was edited by Dave Hicks (see <A HREF="950_L2H_EMailaddressesH.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) for proper, correct English. So this version should be free
of grammatical errors -- assuming that I haven't inserted new bugs in the
new &amp; updated sections in this version. Dave also sends me a lot of
new information and some bug reports for RXT&amp;T.
<P>
Many thanks to Dave for his great work!
<P>
Also thanks to the other users who send me bug reports and new information
for REXX Tips &amp; Tricks. I hope that I've mentioned all of them in the
section <A HREF="101_L3_Hints&Bugreports.html">Hints &amp; Bug reports</A>.
Please let me know if I've forgotten someone so I can correct this mistake
in the next version of RXT&amp;T.
<P>
<B>A note to the German users of this document:</B>
<P>
There's definitely no German version of this version of RXT&amp;T! I mention
this because some German readers of the previous version asked me for a
German version of RXT&amp;T. I've only used the German language for the
version 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4. Since version 1.5 RXT&amp;T is only available
in English language (There is some German information in this document,
see <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using IPF Keys</A> for the details).

<P>
If you really want a German version of RXT&amp;T you might check if one
of the old German version is still available in one of your local BBSes.
The filename of the archive with the last German version is<B> RXTT14.EXE</B>.

<BR>
Generally I suggest you use the current English version and send <A HREF="002_L1_GeneralForeword.html">me
</A>an EMail if you've got a question concerning RXT&amp;T (You can use
the German language for EMails).
<P>
Sorry about that but there are many more user understanding English than
German.
