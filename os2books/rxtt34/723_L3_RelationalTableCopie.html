Description from the author:
<P>
"This utility is designed to copy the result of an SQL "Select" statement
from one database (source) to one or more target databases at one or more
target LUs (targets).  Since this is a DB2/2 utility, you can copy a table
from/to any database that can be accessed via DB2/2 APIs (i.e. not only
DB2/2 databases per-se, but any database DB2/2 supports connects to, such
as DRDA databases (DB2,SQL/DS,etc.)).  The utility consists of two programs,
one of which connects to the source database, the other of which connects
to the target database.  This is necessary because DB2/2 does not allow
a single process to simultaneously connect to two or more databases.
<P>
The "exporter" (source) and "importer" (target) talk to each other using
Appc.  This transport mechanism has the advantage of allowing the exporter
and importer to run on different OS/2 machines.  The only necessary relationship
between two participating OS/2 machines is that they be "mutually Lu6.2
addressable."  That is, the exporter machine must be able to bind an Lu6.2
session with the importer machine.  Needless to say, this requires Communications
Manager in addition to Database Manager."
