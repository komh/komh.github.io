<P>
To give a subroutine using the keyword PROCEDURE</A> access to more than
one global variable, you can use the keyword EXPOSE</A> with a variable
list in parenthesis. Be aware, however, that in this case the variable containing
the names of the exposed variables is also exposed! This is WAD, but poorly
documented in the online help. (see also <A HREF="228_L3_Thekeywordinstructio.html">The
keyword instruction PROCEDURE</A> and <A HREF="308_L2_EXPOSEdoesnotworkase.html">EXPOSE
does not work as expected</A>)
<P>
Example:
<PRE> 
/* sample program to show a side effect of the EXPOSE keyword         */

  varA = 1
  varB = 2

  exposeVars = "VarA VarB"

  say "Variable values before calling test:"

  say "  varA is " || varA
  say "  varB is " || varB
  say "  exposeVars is " || exposeVars

  say
  say "Now calling the sub routine test ..."

  call test

  say "Variable values after calling test:"

  say "  varA is " || varA
  say "  varB is " || varB
  say "  exposeVars is " || exposeVars

return

test: PROCEDURE expose (exposeVars)

  say " -----------------------------------------------------------"
  say " Now the sub routine test is activ ..."
  say ""
  say "  test is declared as "
  say "    test: PROCEDURE expose (exposeVars)"
  say ""
  say " The values of the known global variables are:"
  say "  varA is " || varA
  say "  varB is " || varB
  say "  exposeVars is " || exposeVars

  say " Now changing exposeVars to ""VarC VarD"" inside of ""test"" ..."
  exposeVars = "VarC VarD"
  say ""
  say " ... the routine ""test"" ends here"
  say " -----------------------------------------------------------"

return
