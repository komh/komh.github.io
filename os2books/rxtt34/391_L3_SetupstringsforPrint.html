                                  time a print job is
                                  submitted to this
                                  PrintObject.

  PORTNAME         portname       The names of already

                                  use. For example:

                                  format.

                   NO             The PrintObject spools
                                  print jobs in

                   NO | YES       Printing is not, or is,
                                  enabled while the job

  QSTARTTIME       time           The time when the
                                  PrintObject starts
                                  printing. The time
                                  format is HH:MM, and
                                  the base is a 24-hour
                                  clock.

  QSTOPTIME        time           The time when the
                                  PrintObject is to stop
                                  printing. The time
                                  format is HH:MM, and
                                  the base is a 24-hour

  QUEUENAME        queue_name     The local queue_name
                                  for the PrintObject. If

                                  specified, one is
                                  created by the
                                  PrintObject. The
                                  queue_name key will be
                                  ignored if this object
                                  has already been
                                  assigned a queue.

  QUEUEDRIVER      qdrvname       The queue driver name.
                                  The queue driver must

                                  and will usually be
                                  PMPRINT.

  SEPARATORFILE    filename       A separator file that
                                  prints before each
                                  print job.
