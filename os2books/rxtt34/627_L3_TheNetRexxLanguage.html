"NetRexx is a new human-oriented programming language, designed as an effective
and simple alternative to the Java language.  With NetRexx, you can create
programs and applets for the Java environment faster and more easily than
by programming in Java.  Using and writing Java classes is especially easy
in NetRexx, as the different types of numbers and strings that Java expects
are handled automatically by the language.
<P>
Inspired by two very different programming languages, Rexx and Java, NetRexx
blends the easy-to-learn syntax of Rexx with the robustness and portability
of the Java environment.  The result is a language which is tuned for both
scripting and application development, and is therefore truly general-purpose.

<P>
Mike Cowlishaw, IBM Fellow, wrote his first interpreter while still at school
in Bath, England.  For over 25 years he has been designing and implementing
compilers, interpreters, editors, and productivity tools for both mainframes
and personal computers.
<P>
In this book, Mike both introduces and defines the NetRexx language; these
descriptions are complemented by a discussion of the key design principles
of the language."
