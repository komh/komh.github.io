<H1>Using Object REXX and the WPS</H1><!-- entering slot 294 -->
<P>
It seems that the WPS part of Object REXX never finishes its initialisation
part and therefore has to be forced to do so to use the WPS classes in Object
REXX programs.
<BR>
You can force the finishing of the initialisation by opening the Template
folder for example - but that's no general solution of course.
<P>
To test if this bug occurs on your system, simply issue the command
<PRE> 
  rexxtry say .wps
</PRE>

<P>
If the output is<B><I> .WPS</B></I> then the error occurs on your system.

<P>
As a workaround to the WPS Server not getting initialized you can put a
program object with the following settings in your startup folder:
<P>
Program  = c:\os2\wpsinst.cmd
<BR>
Parameter = +
<P>
This may help ensure that the WPS part of Object REXX finishes its initialization
at startup (note that not all who have tried this have reported success).

<P>

<P>
It seems that the WPS part of Object REXX is incompatible with some other
WPS Extensions, for example Object Desktop. In this case, you must decide
either to use the WPS part of Object REXX or the WPS Extension.
<P>
To use Object REXX with Object Desktop you only need to deinstall the "Enhanced
Folder" Component of Object Desktop -- that's the only part of Object Desktop
that is affected by Object REXX.
<P>
If you want to keep Object Desktop's Enhanced Folder on your desktop, all
you need to do is to NOT install the WPS classes of Object REXX (these are
the classes initialized by the<B> wpsinst.cmd</B> program). Object REXX
will still be loaded and you'll still have access to all Object REXX commands,
except the ones involving the new classes.
