Description from the author:
<P>
"The Rexx sockets API supplied with OS/2 TCP/IP is significantly different
from the APIs supplied with VM/ESA and OS/390. REXXSOCKVM supplies an alternate
API which is roughly source-compatible with the mainframe versions, eliminating
one obstacle to porting Rexx programs.
<P>
Version 1.0 of the API should be considered an alpha. Code is complete except
for the TRANSLATE and SELECT functions, except as noted below. However some
functions and options have not been completely tested. I developed REXXSOCKVM
to support another project and wanted to release the alpha version pending
further work. Bug reports, especially if accompanied by a fix, are welcomed.
Please report bugs to the author."
