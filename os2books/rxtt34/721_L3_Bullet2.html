Description from the author:
<P>
"Bullet/REXX is an interface to the database engine called Bullet.  It closely
follows the compiler-version of Bullet in programming so any Bullet programmer
can be up and using Bullet/REXX in just a few minutes -- as long as it takes
to read this file.  New Bullet programmers will have to learn Bullet first,
but REXX makes this as easy as possible.  If you need a database engine,
 you'll want to check out this product.  One thing Bullet is more than anything
else is fast.  There's nothing faster!  For example, the compiled version
of Bullet is up to 700 times faster than MS's Access DBMS on inserts, and
even the REXX version can reindex files at the rate of 1 million records/minute
using a typical desktop PC."
<P>
There's also now a non-Beta release of Bullet available. But this release
is not free anymore. You can download a crippled demo of Bullet/2; the name
of the file is<B> bulletNN.zip</B> where NN is the version number (25 at
this time).
