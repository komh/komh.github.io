                                  articles.

  ENABLEPROXY      YES            This sets the default value for
                                  PROXYGATEWAY for all URL objects.
                                  If the "Enable proxy?" check box on
                                  the Server page is checked. the
                                  proxy server will be used.

                   NO             If the "Enable proxy?" check box is
                                  not checked, the proxy server will
                                  not be used.

                                  the URL object.
                                  For example, the IBM WebExplorer
                                  browser has been integrated, you
                                  would specify YES if you are using
                                  EXPLORE.EXE.  The Java Applet viewer
                                  is not integrated if you are using
                                  APPLET.EXE.
                                  Other browsers might not be
                                  integrated with the URL object.

                                  unable to use certain browser
                                  parameters (for example, Palette
                                  Aware, Presentation Mode, and Load
                                  Graphics) because a non-integrated
                                  browser <!-- entering slot 411 -->cannot interpret these

                                  graphics" check box on the Web page
                                  is checked.

                   NO             If the "Load graphics" check box is
                                  not checked, will only be able to
                                  view text, but not graphics, on a
                                  web page.  This will speed up page
                                  downloads if you specific not to

                                  The keywords LOCATOR and URL can be
                                  used interchangeably.

                                  started.  If the browser being used
                                  permits optional parameters, declare
                                  them using this value.
                                  This sets the default value for

                                  presentations.  This value is used
                                  for the "Presentation mode" check
                                  box on the Web page.  This is the
