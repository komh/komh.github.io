<H1>Foreword for Version 1.60</H1><!-- entering slot 5 -->
<P>
Here it is, the new version of REXX Tips &amp; Tricks.
<P>
This version has some bug corrections and some new entries. Also I rewrote
a lot of sections to avoid the word "must".
<BR>
I've deleted the automatic link to the <A VIEWPORT GROUP=4100 HREF="107_L4_Menu.html"><!-- extra bytes: 0C 04 04 10 04 00 -->Menu
</A>in the source code samples because it prevented the use of the FORWARD
button to walk through the samples. To use the menu in this version again,
you can either open it once and it will stay open until you close it or
you use the new implemented IPF KEY to enable the automatic link again (see
section <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using IPF Keys</A>).
<P>
German users of this document should set an additional IPF KEY to get some
more German related information (see also the section <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using
IPF Keys</A>).
<P>
This version doesn't cover information about the new <A HREF="269_L1_HintsforObjectREXX.html">Object-Oriented
REXX</A> This is due to the fact that I haven't got the time to take an
in depth look at it.
<P>
My request for response in the <A HREF="004_L3_ForewordforVersion15.html">previous
version</A> of RXT&amp;T wasn't very successful -- there were 0 (in words:
ZERO) contributions. So, either my English is really good ;-) or the interest
in RXT&amp;T isn't very great. I hope the first is true. But, of course,
the request for responses stands there anyway.
