Description from the author:
<P>
"The ORexx/SQL Object Framework is a set of ORexx classes which encapsulate
<A HREF="724_L3_REXXSQL.html">Mark Hessling's Rexx/SQL interface</A> to
SQL databases available from Mark's Home page (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>)
<P>
The Rexx/SQL interface provides cross platform (OS/2, UNIX, Win 95/NT),
RDBMS independent (too many to list here, see the web page) access to SQL
databases through a loadable external rexx library. The ORexx/SQL Object
Framework extends this functionality by providing an extensible Object-Oriented
interface to Rexx/SQL on platforms with ORexx implementations (currently
OS/2 &amp; Win 95/NT). The Framework further simplifies SQL database access
by managing database connections and queries for the programmer and through
its built in error handling facilities.
<P>
The framework can be used in two ways, either as an OO wrapper for the Rexx/SQL
interface or as a Streams based interface to a SQL database. Either of these
interfaces can be used as the basis for more complex, reusable, application
specific classes.
<P>
When used as wrapper classes, you create connection, table and result table
objects as needed and use the methods provided by these objects to query
and update database tables. This gives you access to the entire functionality
of the Rexx/SQL interface.
<P>
When using the Streams interface, you create SQLStream objects which create
and manage other SQL objects as needed. SQLStream objects allow you to access
a database using an interface similar to that which standard Stream objects
provide.
<P>
In addition to providing an OO interface to Rexx/SQL, the classes have built
in exception handling which can be customized or overridden. Using the Framework's
exception handling eliminates the need for inline error checking and allows
the programmer to write code which is easier to read and maintain.
<P>
The ORexx/SQL Object Framework was developed and tested on Windows NT with
an Oracle server. If you are using a different platform or database and
experience problems using ORexx/SQL Objects let me know and I'll try to
incorporate any necessary changes into future versions"
