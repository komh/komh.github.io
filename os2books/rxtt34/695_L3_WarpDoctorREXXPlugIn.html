Hopefully this limitation will be removed in further versions!

Description from the authors:
<P>
"Rexx a substitute for Java? We think so, especially on OS/2. With the WarpDoctor
Rexx Plug-in you can do in Rexx just about everything that you can do in
Java, but faster and easier.
<P>
Java was designed as an interpreted language that was targeted at embedded
systems. It "took off" as the darling language of the late 1990s when Netscape
decided to include a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in all their browsers and
to recognize a new APPLET HTML tag which allowed Java programs to be downloaded
from a web server on demand and run as "applets" within an HTML page - the
applet being assigned an area on the page by the applet tag.
<P>
The WarpDoctor Rexx Plug-in does for Rexx what Netscape's inclusion of the
JVM and applet tag did for Java: it enables Rexx programs to be downloaded
from a web server on demand and run in an area of an HTML page, appearing
to be part of the page. The WD Rexx plug-in however also enables downloaded
Rexx programs to be run in their own Command Prompt window or in a separate
window provided by a visual Rexx environment (such as VX-Rexx, GPF Rexx,
etc.) , and to run with output directed to a window on the HTML page.
<P>
This is the project page for the WarpDoctor Rexx Plug-in. The WD Rexx plug-in
was developed by the WarpDoctor project team to facilitate data entry to,
and maintenance of, the database used to store the content of the WarpDoctor
site. While the plug-in was created specifically to solve WarpDoctor's database
needs it was designed to be generic, to run any Rexx program from any web
site. And in the spirit of WarpDoctor the plug-in and source code are made
freely available to the OS/2 community in hopes that it will prove useful
to other sites and users so that the entire OS/2 community can benefit."
