<H1>Foreword for Version 3.30</H1><!-- entering slot 22 -->
<P>
And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.

<P>
This version is again only a maintenance update - there are only a lot of
new entries in the <A HREF="634_L1_AdditionalSoftwarefo.html">section with
Additional Software for REXX</A>.
<P>
One new DLL I found in the internet is <A HREF="793_L3_RxCell.html">RxCell.dll
</A>Unfortunately the complete documentation (including the comments in
the examples) is in Japanese so I don't really know what this DLL is for.
If anybody knows Japanese and can send me a short description of the DLL
in English I would really appreciate it.

I found a method to close a folder from with a REXX program (see <A HREF="420_L3_ClosingaWPSfolder.html">Closing
a WPS folder</A>) But I'm still searching for the necessary ID for the <A HREF="386_L4_IDsforthesetupstring.html">setup
string MENUITEMSELECTED</A> to do this. If anybody knows this information
please let me know.

Thanks to Steven Levine (see <A HREF="954_L2H_EMailaddressesL.html">EMail
Addresses</A>) the readme file should now be more helpful.
