<P>
This document contains tips &amp; tricks about REXX programming under OS/2.
It also contains general information about REXX, including literature, third-party
software, REXX on non-OS/2 platforms, and more.
<P>
This document is intended for people who already have some knowledge in
REXX programming.
<P>
Absolute beginners in REXX programming should read one of the REXX tutorials
(see the <A HREF="569_L1_Literature.html">Literature</A> section) before
reading this document. English-speaking users without any programming experience
might take a look at <A HREF="586_L3_LearnREXXProgramming.html">Learn REXX
Programming in 56,479 Easy Steps</A>, but there are several other excellent
books and tutorials available on REXX as well.
<P>
First-time readers of this document should read the sections <A HREF="103_L3_InstallingREXXTips&T.html">Installing
REXX Tips &amp; Tricks</A>, <A HREF="106_L3_Usingthesamples.html">Using
the samples</A>, <A HREF="108_L3_UsingIPFKeys.html">Using IPF Keys</A> and
<A HREF="110_L3_IconsUsedinREXXTips&.html">Icons used in REXX Tips &amp;
Tricks</A> before using this document. Those who are familiar with RXT&amp;T
might re-visit those sections from time to time; they will find they get
more out of RXT&amp;T when they actively use the suggestions given in those
sections.
<P>
I also recommend that readers visit frequently the REXX home page maintained
by Mike Cowlishaw, the REXX FAQ maintained by Dave Martin and the home page
of the <A HREF="907_L2_REXXLanguageAssociat.html">REXX Language Association
</A> (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet - Web Pages</A>).
<P>
Since January 2001 I work as a freelancer. So, if you need support for OS/2
(Server or Clients), REXX programming, or any flavour of Unix you're welcome
to contact me.
