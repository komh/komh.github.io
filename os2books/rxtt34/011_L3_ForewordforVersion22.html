<H1>Foreword for Version 2.20</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
And here it is: The next version of RXT&amp;T.

<P>
This version has only a few enhancements. One section you might look at
is the section about the DETACH command because I finally found a solution
to capture the output of the DETACH</A> command (see <A HREF="170_L3_Detachaprogram&captu.html">Detach
a program &amp; capture the PID</A>).

Some News from the 7th REXX Symposium helt in Austin from May 13th to 15th
- The official report should be available in the near future at the REXX
homepage (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet - Web Pages</A>).

<P>
Object REXX for OS/2 is now GA. Also, the Windows 95 and Windows NT version
of Object REXX are available for evaluation (see <A HREF="878_L3_InternetWWW.html">Internet
- Web Pages</A>).
<P>
There's now an ANSI Standard for REXX - see <A HREF="909_L2_REXXANSIStandard.html">REXX
ANSI Standard</A>.
<P>
Mike Cowlishaw (see <A HREF="945_L2H_EMailaddressesC.html">EMail Addresses</A>)
has developed a new REXX dialect called <A HREF="910_L2_NetRexx.html">NetRexx</A>.
NetRexx compiles to Java Bytecode. It's a much simpler way to create Java
Applets than doing it in Java.
