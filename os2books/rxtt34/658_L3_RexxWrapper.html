Description from the author:
<P>
"Rexx/Wrapper is a tool that wraps a Rexx source file, or tokenised code
into an executable program.
<BR>
The Rexx source code can be optionally compressed and encoded to ensure
that the original Rexx code cannot be viewed (unless you have the original
encryption key).
<P>
To use Rexx/Wrapper you need two extra bits of software:
<BR>
1) A supported Rexx interpreter
<BR>
2) A supported C compiler
<P>
The Rexx interpreter that is linked with the executable must be capable
of executing an "instore" Rexx macro via the SAA API.
<BR>
The Rexx interpreter used to build the executable wrapper can be different
to the interpreter used to run the executable program.
<BR>
If wrapping tokenised code, then the Rexx interpreter that creates the tokenised
code, MUST be the same interpreter that runs the tokenised code.
<P>
All suppliers of Rexx interpreters provide access to their interpreter via
a shared or dynamic library. This means that it is not possible to build
a completely stand-alone executable; you will always have to include the
shared or dynamic library with the executable built with Rexx/Wrapper.
<P>
There is one exception to this rule; Regina.  Regina also provides a static
library, which means you can link your program with Regina's static library,
and you will get a completely stand-alone executable.
<P>
There is a catch however with using the Regina static library :-(. The Rexx
program that you wrap, cannot dynamically load an external function package.
 This is because the Regina static library does not (and cannot) support
the dynamic loading of external functions.  External functions, by their
very nature, require the presence of a dynamic or shared library to operate.

<P>
Rexx/Wrapper supports all C compilers that support ANSI prototypes. Rexx/Wrapper
will not work with older K&amp;R C Compilers.
<P>
For a list of the supported C compilers for the current platform, run rexxwrap.cmd
with the '-help' switch and see the list below."
