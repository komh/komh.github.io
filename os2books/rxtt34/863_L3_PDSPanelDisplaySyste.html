Description from the author:
<P>
"The Panel Display System provides a simple yet powerful method by which
an application developer can create an interactive user interface without
requiring OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM).
<P>
The method by which information is presented by the application to the end
user and information from the end user is returned to the application is
via a construct known as a 'PANEL'.
<P>
A panel is defined by the developer and displayed by the application thru
calls to the REXX application programming interface (API), herein referred
to as the REXX Panel Display API or rxPD, or thru calls to an optional high
level language interface.
<P>
As the end user interacts with a displayed panel, the PD system takes care
of most keystrokes and combinations of keystrokes, known as chords, without
the application having to interpret these keystrokes.
<P>
The application can, however, be written to handle any keystroke that might
require special handling other than the PDS default for that key or chord."
