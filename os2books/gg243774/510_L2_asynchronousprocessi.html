asynchronous processing
<P>
Invocation of another procedure whereby that procedure is dispatched as
a separate thread of execution, independent of the caller.  Control returns
to the caller as soon as dispatching is complete; the caller may then continue
execution without waiting for the dispatched procedure to complete its processing.
 Asynchronous processing enables a Presentation Manager application to preserve
the user responsiveness goals laid down by Common User Access guidelines,
by executing lengthy operations as separate threads of execution.
