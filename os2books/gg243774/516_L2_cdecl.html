Linkage convention used in 16-bit "C" language programming under the IBM
C/2 compiler, which causes the compiler to generate object code for a function
or subroutine, such that parameters are placed on the stack in right-to-left
order when the subroutine is called, and the calling routine clears the
stack after control is returned.  This is the default for "C" programs.
 Contrast with <A HREF="643_L2_pascal.html"><I>pascal</I></A> linkage convention.
