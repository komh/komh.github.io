<H1>Presentation Manager Resources in a DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 436 -->
<P>
As noted in <A HREF="185_L2_DynamicLinking.html">Dynamic Linking</A>, Presentation
Manager resources may be defined and stored in a DLL for use by multiple
applications.  However, the implementation of dynamic linking under OS/2
requires that each DLL must contain an executable module, and resources
are not executable modules in their own right.  If a DLL will contain only
resources and will not contain an executable routine such as a dialog procedure,
a dummy executable module must be provided for the DLL by the application
developer, as shown below:
<PRE>int ARCTUSED = 1;

void EXPENTRY dummy()
{
}
</PRE>

<P>
The declaration for the variable<I> ARCTUSED</I> is provided in order to
avoid an error generated by the IBM C/2 compiler when it cannot find a module
named<I> main</I> within the source file.
<P>
<B>Editor's Note: </B> The above statement may not be true for the C Set/2
compiler.  This must be determined.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
This dummy module is compiled and link-edited into an executable file in
the normal way.  The resource compiler is then used to compile and incorporate
the resource definitions into the executable file.
