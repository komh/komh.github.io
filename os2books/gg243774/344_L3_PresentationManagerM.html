<P>
Since a process in OS/2 owns data resources, window handles are  available
to any threads under the control of that process.  It is  therefore possible
for a secondary thread to post a message to the  window procedure that invoked
it, advising that the secondary thread  has completed its processing.  The
window procedure may then process  the message and take appropriate action.

<P>
This technique may be used by secondary threads that use object  windows
and those which do not.  It requires only that the secondary  thread have
addressability to the window handle of the window procedure  that invoked
it.  This handle may be obtained directly from Presentation Manager, but
 it is recommended that the handle of the invoking window procedure is  passed
to the secondary thread upon invocation.  This may be done in  one of two
ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By including the handle in the<I> CtrlData</I> parameter
of the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> call if the secondary thread is using an
 object window.  This also requires passing the handle as a parameter to
 the<B> _beginthread()</B> call used to create the secondary  thread's main
processing routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By including the handle as a parameter to the <B> DosCreateThread()
</B>call if using a secondary thread without  an object window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The second method described above is illustrated in  <A HREF="099_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using Presentation Manager Messages"</A>.

Where the two communicating windows are under the control of  different
processes, the window handles must be explicitly communicated  from one
to the other since by default, the window handle of a window  in one process
is not available to a window in another process.  One  technique for achieving
this communication involves passing the window  handle of the first window
when the second process is created, and  having the second window return
a message to the first window after  initialization, containing the window
handle of the second window.  This technique allows both communication and
synchronization between  windows.  An example is given in <A HREF="327_L2_CreatingAnotherProce.html">Creating
Another Process</A>.
