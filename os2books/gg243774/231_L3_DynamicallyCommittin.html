<H1>Dynamically Committing Storage</H1><!-- entering slot 247 -->
<P>
Under DOS and previous versions of OS/2, it is common for an application
to allocate a small memory segment to contain a data structure.  If the
data structure outgrows the size of the segment, the segment size may be
progressively increased using the<B> DosReallocSeg()</B> or<B> DosReallocHuge()
</B>functions, moving the segments within the machine's physical memory
in order to accommodate the increased size requirements.  This is not possible
under Version 2.0, since the paged memory implementation does not allow
memory objects to be moved within memory once they are allocated; hence
the<B> DosReallocSeg()</B> and<B> DosReallocHuge()</B> functions have no
counterparts in the 32-bit environment.
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, an application can allocate an area of storage in
its process address space, but may commit only a small amount of that storage
at the time the application is initialized.  In this way, the application
does not use a large amount of storage in a situation where it is not required,
and thereby avoids placing unnecessary resource demands on the operating
system.  This can result in improved overall system performance.
<P>
If the storage requirements for a memory object increase during execution
(for example, the size of a spreadsheet increases), and exceed the amount
of storage initially committed, the application may dynamically commit additional
storage up to the maximum specified in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function
call that allocated the memory object.
<P>
This dynamic commitment of storage is typically achieved using the<B> guard
page technique</B>.  A page within the memory object may be specified as
a <A HREF="581_L2_guardpage.html"><I>guard page</I></A> using the PAG_GUARD
flag in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call or in a<B> DosSetMem()</B> call
made subsequent to the allocation.  Once this is done, any memory reference
to that page will generate a <A HREF="582_L2_guardpageexception.html"><B>guard
page exception</B></A>.  The guard page exception warns the application
that the upper boundary of the committed portion of a memory object has
been reached, and allows appropriate action to be taken in order to avoid
a page fault exception.
<P>
Note that the memory protection scheme implemented by OS/2 Version 2.0  allocates
pages to individual processes.  An exception is<I> only</I> generated when
an application attempts to write into a page which is not allocated to the
current process under which the application is running.  If the page is
allocated to the current process, no exception is generated.  Use of the
guard page technique is therefore strongly recommended in circumstances
where the amount of data to be written into a memory object is variable,
or where the size of the memory object or its data may grow during execution.

<P>
The recommended method of using guard pages is to initially allocate the
memory object as a sparse object, and then commit the amount of storage
required for the current size of the data, flagging the uppermost page of
the memory object as a guard page.  This technique is shown in <A HREF="019_L2_UsingaGuardPageWitha.html">Figure
"Using a Guard Page With a Memory Object"</A>.
<P>
The example shown in <A HREF="019_L2_UsingaGuardPageWitha.html">Figure "Using
a Guard Page With a Memory Object"</A> allocates a memory object that is
72KB in size as a sparse object, commits the first two pages (8KB) of the
object and specifies the uppermost of the two pages as a guard page.  Any
attempt by the application to write into this uppermost page will result
in a guard page exception.
<P>
The guard page exception generated when an application attempts to write
into a guard page can be trapped and processed by an application-registered
exception handler, to commit further pages within the memory object.  A
simple guard page exception handler is shown in <A HREF="020_L2_GuardPageExceptionHa.html">Figure
"Guard Page Exception Handler"</A>.
<P>
The exception handler shown in <A HREF="020_L2_GuardPageExceptionHa.html">Figure
"Guard Page Exception Handler"</A> handles two types of exception:  the
guard page exception and the page fault exception.  The latter occurs when
an application attempts to write to an uncommitted page in the memory object
that is<I> not</I> the guard page.  This can occur when a memory object
is accessed in a non-sequential manner.
<P>
The example shown above handles the guard page exception simply by committing
the next page in the memory object, and making this page the new guard page.
 Guard page exceptions should<I> not</I> be<!-- entering slot 248 --> allowed
to pass through to the operating system's default guard page exception handler,
since the default handler operates by committing the next<I> lower</I> page
in the memory object and making this the new guard page.  This is done because
the default handler is intended mainly to handle dynamic stack growth; stacks
are always propagated downward.
<P>
The exception handler shown in <A HREF="020_L2_GuardPageExceptionHa.html">Figure
"Guard Page Exception Handler"</A> also handles the page fault exception,
where a write operation is attempted into a page other than the guard page,
which has not previously been committed.  The exception handler responds
to this exception by querying the properties of the page in question and,
if the page has been allocated but not yet committed, proceeds to commit
the page.
<P>
If the page has not been allocated (that is, it does not lie within the
boundaries of the memory object), or if the exception is neither a guard
page exception nor a page fault exception, the exception handler does not
process the exception, and returns control to the operating system, which
will invoke any other exception handlers registered for the current thread
(see <A HREF="233_L2_ExceptionHandling.html">Exception Handling</A>).
<P>
A guard page exception handler is registered by the application using the
<B>DosSetExceptionHandler()</B> function.  This function is illustrated
in <A HREF="021_L2_RegisteringaGuardPag.html">Figure "Registering a Guard
Page Exception Handler"</A>.
<P>
The<B> DosSetExceptionHandler()</B> function can also be used to register
exception handlers for other types of system exception; see <A HREF="233_L2_ExceptionHandling.html">Exception
Handling</A> for further information.
<P>
Note that OS/2 Version 2.0 provides its own exception handlers within the
service layers for all 32-bit system functions.  These exception handlers
allow the service routines to recover from page fault exceptions and general
protection exceptions encountered due to bad pointers in applications' function
calls.  The function call returns an ERROR_BAD_PARAMETER code rather than
a Trap 00D or Trap 00E code, thereby allowing the application to recover.
 This represents a significant enhancement over previous versions of OS/2,
since it allows easier debugging and more flexible pointer handling.
