<P>
This type of subroutine should be used where the scope of the processing
performed by a subroutine is limited to a single application  object, but
where the result of that processing must be communicated to  an application
object other than the one that invoked the subroutine.  Since the conventional
method of achieving communication between  objects is via messages, the
subroutine posts a message to the affected  application object using the
<B>WinPostMsg()</B> call, or  synchronously passes the message to the application
object using the<B> WinSendMsg()</B> call (this latter call should be used
with caution; see <A HREF="260_L3_MessageInvocationDir.html">Message Invocation/Direct
Return</A>).  The message is routed to the destination window by Presentation
Manager.  The subroutine typically returns to its caller in the normal fashion;
this method of passing control is therefore merely a variation of the previously
described Direct Invocation/Direct Return method.
<P>
Assuming that the calling routine is a window procedure, the return code
(if any) from the subroutine is passed to the calling window procedure and
that procedure completes its execution before the message  resulting from
the called subroutine is processed.
<P>
Note that this technique can be used where the called subroutine executes
in a secondary thread, and the resulting message is passed back to the calling
window procedure in the primary thread to indicate the completion of the
secondary thread's processing.  See <A HREF="323_L1_MultitaskingConsider.html">Multitasking
Considerations</A> for further discussion of multiple threads.
