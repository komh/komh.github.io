<H1>Initiating a Drag Operation</H1><!-- entering slot 329 -->
<P>
A drag operation is initiated by the source window or object.  When the
user starts the drag operation by pressing and holding down mouse button
2, Presentation Manager passes a WM_BEGINDRAG message to the window or object
that is currently under the mouse pointer. In the case of a Presentation
Manager window, the window procedure for that window may process the WM_BEGINDRAG
message in order to initialize the DRAGINFO and DRAGITEM structures, and
start the drag operation.  A Workplace Shell object is notified of a drag
initiation by the Workplace Shell itself, which invokes the object's<I> _wpFormatDragItem
</I>method.
<P>
The initialization of a drag operation from a container window is shown
in <A HREF="069_L2_DragInitiationFromaC.html">Figure "Drag Initiation From
a Container Window"</A>.
<P>
The code shown in <A HREF="069_L2_DragInitiationFromaC.html">Figure "Drag
Initiation From a Container Window"</A> would form part of the window procedure
for the owner of the container control, since it is this window that would
receive the WM_CONTROL message from the container.
<P>
<B>Initializing Data Structures</B>
<P>
When a WM_CONTROL message is received from a container window, a pointer
to a CNRDRAGINIT structure is passed in the second parameter to the WM_CONTROL
message.  This structure contains a pointer to the item within the container
that the user is attempting to drag.  If this pointer is NULL, the user
has attempted a drag operation while no item in the container was selected.
 In the current example, the drag operation is ignored and control is immediately
returned to Presentation Manager.
<P>
The source window then allocates a DRAGINFO structure using the<B> DrgAllocDraginfo()
</B>function.  The DRAGITEM structure is initialized with the appropriate
values, and its pointer is set in the DRAGINFO structure using the<B> DrgSetDragItem()
</B>function. All interaction with the DRAGINFO structure is performed using
Presentation Manager functions, avoiding the necessity for the source window
procedure to address the DRAGINFO structure directly.
<P>
The DRAGIMAGE structure is then initialized with the information relating
to the icon that will be displayed under the mouse pointer during the drag
operation.
<P>
For a Workplace Shell object, the Workplace Shell itself performs the initialization
of the DRAGINFO structure.  The object may perform its own initialization
of the DRAGITEM structure during processing of the<I> _wpFormatDragItem
</I>method, if class-specific processing is required.  For example, if the
object class implements a private rendering mechanism, the appropriate information
must be entered into the correct fields in the DRAGITEM structure as part
of the<I> _wpFormatDragItem</I> method.
<P>
Note that a Workplace Shell object need not allocate the DRAGITEM structure,
since the structure is already allocated by the Workplace Shell, and a pointer
to the structure is passed to the<I> _wpFormatDragItem</I> method upon invocation.

<P>
<B>DrgDrag() Processing</B>
<P>
Once all data structures are allocated and initialized, the drag operation
is initiated using the<B> DrgDrag()</B> function. This function is synchronous;
it does not return control to the source window procedure until the key
or mouse button specified in the fifth parameter (VK_ENDDRAG in the example
above) is detected, and any synchronous message passing has been completed.

<P>
At this point, the<B> DrgDrag()</B> function returns a window handle.  If
the dragitem was dropped over a window or object that was able to accept
the item, the window handle of the target window is returned.  If a drop
occurred over an object that was unable to accept the item, a NULL window
handle is returned.
<P>
Upon return of control by the<B> DrgDrag()</B> function, the drag operation
and the drop operation (if any) is complete, and the DRAGINFO structure
can be released by the source window procedure.
<P>
A Workplace Shell object is not required to invoke the<B> DrgDrag()</B> function,
since this is performed automatically by the Workplace Shell when the object
completes the processing of its<I> _wpFormatDragItem</I> method.
<P>
<B>Synchronous Message Processing During DrgDrag()</B>
<P>
When the user drops the dragitem over another window or object that is able
to accept the item, a DM_DROP message is passed to the target, which then
processes the drop operation.  Note that the target's DM_DROP message processing
must complete and return control to Presentation Manager before the<B> DrgDrag()
</B>function will return control to the source window procedure.  Thus any
processing that is performed by the target window during its processing
of the DM_DROP message is synchronous.
<P>
The synchronous nature of this processing is necessary in order to ensure
that the drop operation, and the accompanying transfer of information, is
completed before the user performs any other operation.  For this reason,
it is recommended that any messages passed by the target to the source window
during processing of the DM_DROP message should be passed synchronously
using the<B> DrgSendTransferMsg()</B> function. This is a departure from
the normal Presentation Manager guidelines, where messages are processed
asynchronously, but is required in order to ensure data integrity.
<P>
A number of synchronous messages may be sent to the source window<!-- entering slot 330 --> at
the completion of a drop, prior to the<B> DrgDrag()</B> call returning control
to the source window.  For example, if the user drops an object on a Workplace
Shell printer object with the DRM_PRINT rendering mechanism specified, the
target object sends a DM_PRINTOBJECT message to the source window.  This
message contains sufficient information for the source window to direct
a print data stream to the print queue represented by the printer object.
 The first parameter in the DM_PRINTOBJECT message contains a pointer to
the DRAGITEM structure that identifies the item being dropped, and the second
parameter contains the name of the print queue for the printer object.
<P>
An example of the way in which the source window procedure may process the
DM_PRINTOBJECT message is shown in <A HREF="070_L2_ReceivingaDM_PRINTOB.html">Figure
"Receiving a DM_PRINTOBJECT Message"</A>.
<P>
Note that the code that actually performs the printing operation has been
omitted from <A HREF="070_L2_ReceivingaDM_PRINTOB.html">Figure "Receiving
a DM_PRINTOBJECT Message"</A>.  Printing under OS/2 Version 2.0 and Presentation
Manager is discussed in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 5:  Print
Subsystem</I>, and examples are also provided in the PRTSAMP program included
in the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0.
