<H1>Object Behavior</H1><!-- entering slot 302 -->
<P>
The behavior of an object in the Workplace Shell is very similar to that
of a window under Presentation Manager.  An object must have its class registered
with the system, an instance of that class must be created ("instantiated")
in the system, and that instance (and any other instance) then receives
messages and uses its methods to process these messages. When processing
is completed, the instance may be destroyed.
<P>
One significant difference between a Workplace Shell object class and a
window class under Presentation Manager is that Workplace Shell object classes
are normally <A HREF="645_L2_persistent.html"><B>persistent</B></A>; that
is, while a Presentation Manager window class is defined only for the duration
of the application's execution, a Workplace Shell object class remains defined
to the system, and is useable by any application until such time as it is
explicitly deregistered from the system.
