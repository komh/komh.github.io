load-time dynamic linking
<P>
Form of dynamic linking where resolution of external references takes place
during loading of the application into memory.  Load-time dynamic linking
is typically used to share a single memory-resident copy of common application
service routines, or to isolate portions of application code from the remainder
of the application, thereby facilitating any future change management.  See
also <A HREF="671_L2_runtimedynamiclinkin.html">run-time dynamic linking</A>.
