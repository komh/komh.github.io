<H1>Passing Messages to 32-Bit Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 422 -->
<P>
The technique described above handles messages passed to a window in a 16-bit
module.  However, messages passed from that window to the 32-bit module
may also require thunking.  In order to perform this thunking, the 32-bit
application may define a<B> thunk procedure</B> and register this procedure
to Presentation Manager, which then invokes the thunk procedure whenever
a message is passed from within the window.
<P>
This registration is achieved using the<B> WinSetWindowThunkProc()</B> function,
which is illustrated in <A HREF="116_L2_MixedModelProgrammin.html">Figure
"Mixed Model Programming - WinSetWindowThunkProc() Function"</A>.
<P>
The<B> WinSetWindowThunkProc()</B> function call is made from the 32-bit
module. Since the window class for the window has been registered in the
16-bit module, Presentation Manager recognizes that the thunk procedure
is to handle 16-bit to 32-bit conversion.
<P>
A thunk procedure may be deregistered, by issuing a<B> WinSetWindowThunkProc()
</B>function call with the thunk procedure entry point address set to NULL.

<P>
Whenever Presentation Manager invokes a thunk procedure for a message, it
passes the normal four parameters accepted by a window procedure, along
with the entry point address of the window procedure to which the message
was to be passed.  This may be the window procedure defined for the destination
window when its class was registered, or a subclass window procedure defined
by the application.  Thus thunking may take place, irrespective of whether
a window has been subclassed.
<P>
A sample thunk procedure is shown in <A HREF="117_L2_MixedModelProgrammin.html">Figure
"Mixed Model Programming - Thunk Procedure"</A>.
<P>
The thunk procedure is invoked whenever a message is passed by the window
in the 16-bit module to a window in the 32-bit module.  The thunk procedure
is similar in structure to a "normal" window procedure, but need contain
cases only for application-defined message classes, since thunking for system-defined
message classes is performed by Presentation Manager.
<P>
Note that since the thunk procedure is invoked by Presentation Manager,
it must use the<I> system</I> linkage convention, and is thus declared using
the EXPENTRY keyword.
<P>
In <A HREF="117_L2_MixedModelProgrammin.html">Figure "Mixed Model Programming
- Thunk Procedure"</A>, the 16-bit window contains two application-defined
message classes, WMP_MSG1 and WMP_MSG2.  The first of these contains pointers
in both parameters, and thus both parameters are thunked by the thunk procedure.
 The second message class contains a pointer in the first message paramater
only; the second may contain an integer or some simple value parameter which
does not require explicit thunking.  Thunking is performed using the<B> DosSeltoFlat()
</B>function provided by OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
After performing the necessary thunking, the thunk procedure directly calls
the window procedure entry point supplied by Presentation Manager when the
thunk procedure is invoked.  Note that this is one of the few instances
where direct invocation of a window procedure should be used.  The correct
sequence of message processing is preserved in this case because the thunk
procedure itself is invoked either synchronously or asynchronously by Presentation
Manager, depending upon whether the message was sent or posted by the 16-bit
window.
<P>
An alternative to the use of the<B> DosSeltoFlat()</B> function is the explicit
use of the Compability Region Mapping Algorithm discussed in<I> OS/2 Version
2.0 - Volume 1: Control Program</I>.  This algorithm is implemented in the
subroutine<I> CRMA16to32</I> shown in <A HREF="118_L2_1616to032AddressConv.html">Figure
"16:16 to 0:32 Address Conversion"</A>.
<P>
The use of the<B> DosSeltoFlat()</B> function should be the preferred option,
since the CRMA routines may fail under certain circumstances.  Explicit
use of CRMA should be restricted to those situations where special processing
must be performed on the parameters being passed.
