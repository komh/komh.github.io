<H1>Associating a Help Instance</H1><!-- entering slot 452 -->
<P>
Once the help instance has been created, it must be associated with an application
window.  The help instance is normally associated with the application's
main frame window, and help may therefore be provided for any children of
the frame window, including the menu bar and client window.  The<B> WinAssociateHelpInstance()
</B>function is used to associate a help instance with an application window;
an example of this function is shown in <A HREF="133_L2_WinAssociateHelpInst.html">Figure
"WinAssociateHelpInstance() Function"</A>.
<P>
The<B> WinAssociateHelpInstance()</B> function is normally called from the
application's main routine, immediately following the<B> WinCreateHelpInstance()
</B>function call.
