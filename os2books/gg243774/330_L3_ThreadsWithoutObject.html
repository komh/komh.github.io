<H1>Threads Without Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 364 -->
<P>
Secondary threads without object windows are typically created to  perform
a lengthy processing operation within the scope of a single  event.  A window
procedure under the control of the primary thread  creates the secondary
thread to process a particular subroutine, and  the secondary thread terminates
automatically when this subroutine  reaches an exit point.  However, the
<B>DosExit()</B> function should be called as the last action in the secondary
thread, in order  to ensure that the memory allocated for the thread's stack
is correctly released by the operating system.
<P>
However, some checks may be necessary to ensure orderly termination  of
a secondary thread, particularly where access to data objects is  involved.
Upon termination of an application's primary thread, all  secondary threads
that have not already been terminated by the  application are forcibly terminated
by OS/2.  Where the secondary  thread's processing involves a critical data
operation such as the  update of a database, the primary thread should ensure
that the  secondary thread has completed its processing before allowing
itself to  terminate.
<P>
It is recommended that before creating a secondary thread without an object
window, a window procedure should set an event semaphore, and pass the handle
of this semaphore to the secondary thread.  The event semaphore is then
cleared by the secondary thread as the<I> last action</I> before it terminates.

<P>
Upon receiving a WM_DESTROY message, the window procedure in the primary
thread should test the state of the event semaphore and wait for the semaphore
to clear before completing the WM_DESTROY message processing (which should
include releasing the semaphore) and returning control to Presentation Manager.
 This will ensure that the secondary thread terminates in an orderly manner
before the primary thread is terminated.
<P>
The use of event semaphores is described in more detail in <A HREF="343_L2_MaintainingSynchroni.html">Maintaining
Synchronization</A>.
