<H1>Window Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
Each window class is associated with a <A HREF="712_L2_windowprocedure.html"><B>window
procedure</B></A>, which defines and/or establishes access to data objects
and performs processing related to that window class.  In object-oriented
terms, the window procedure contains the methods to carry out actions upon
the data object referenced by the window.
<P>
A window procedure is normally invoked by Presentation Manager on behalf
of the application.  The window procedure interprets messages passed by
Presentation Manager to the window and invokes a method (that is, a coherent
set of application statements and/or routines) depending on the nature and
contents of the message.
<P>
See <A HREF="215_L3_WindowProcedures.html">Window Procedures</A> for a more
complete discussion of window procedures' structure and behavior.
