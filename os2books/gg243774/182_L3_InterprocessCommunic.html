<H1>Interprocess Communication and Synchronization</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
Since OS/2 provides support for concurrent execution of multiple processes,
with memory protection between these processes, it must also provide mechanisms
to facilitate synchronization and communication between different processes
and threads executing in the system, which may wish to share data and control
information.  OS/2 provides a number of such mechanisms, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Shared memory<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Queues<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Pipes (both named and anonymous)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Presentation Manager messages<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Semaphores.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These mechanisms allow application developers to implement applications
using multiple processes or threads, while retaining the ability to communicate
data and control information in a controlled manner, and to achieve synchronization
between various components of an application.
<P>
<B>Shared Memory</B>
<P>
The OS/2 memory management architecture utilizes the protect mode of the
Intel 80386 processor to achieve memory isolation between processes.  A
process has addressability only to its own memory objects.  However, in
certain circumstances processes may wish to communicate and pass data to
each other; OS/2 allows this by the use of<I> shared memory objects</I>.
 Shared memory objects are dynamically requested from the operating system
by the application during execution, and are flagged as shareable by OS/2.
 It is the responsibility of the applications concerned however, to correctly
synchronize the flow of data between processes.  OS/2 provides a number
of mechanisms by which this synchronization may be achieved.  Shared memory
and its usage is discussed in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application Design
Guide</I>.
<P>
<B>Queues</B>
<P>
Queueing system calls are implemented by a system service routine that uses
shared memory and semaphores (see below) for serialization.  A queue is
created by a process that then becomes the owner of that queue;<I> only
</I>the owner may read from the queue.  Other processes may write to the
queue, but only the owner may look at elements on the queue, remove elements
from the queue, purge or delete the queue.  Queues may be specified with
FIFO (first-in, first-out) or LIFO (last-in, first-out) dispatching priority.

<P>
A queue has a name, similar to a file name, by which it is known to both
processes and by which it is referred to when the queue is first accessed
by a particular process.  A series of operating system functions is provided
by OS/2 to create and access queues.  Queues are discussed in detail in
the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application Design Guide</I>.
<P>
<B>Pipes</B>
<P>
A pipe is a FIFO data structure that permits two processes to communicate
using file system I/O calls.  The first process writes data into the pipe
and the second process reads the data from the pipe.  However, the data
is never actually written to an external file, but is held in a shared area
in memory.
<P>
A pipe may be<I> named</I>, in which case it has a name similar to a file
name which is known by both processes, or it may be<I> anonymous</I> in
which case read and write handles to the pipe are returned by the operating
system when the pipe is created.  It is then the responsibility of the creating
process to communicate these handles to other threads or processes.
<P>
The creation of pipes is achieved using a number of OS/2 function calls;
once created, pipes are then accessed using file system I/O functions. Pipes
and their manipulation are discussed in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application
Design Guide</I>.
<P>
<B>Presentation Manager Messages</B>
<P>
In the OS/2 Presentation Manager programming environment, application routines
known as window procedures communicate by receiving messages from one another
and from Presentation Manager itself.  Messages may be passed between window
procedures executing in the same thread, between different threads in a
process, or between processes.
<P>
Messages may be used to pass data between routines executing in different
threads or processes, or to communicate events in order to achieve synchronization
between threads and/or processes.  Presentation Manager messages may be
used to invoke processing routines in either a synchronous or asynchronous
manner.  The Presentation Manager messaging model conforms closely to object-oriented
programming practices, and is described further in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.
<P>
<B><!-- entering slot 190 -->Atoms</B>
<P>
Where character strings must be passed between threads, it is relatively
simple to pass a pointer to the character string, since all threads within
a process share access to memory objects.  Where strings must be passed
between processes however, more complex methods such as shared memory must
normally be used.  OS/2 provides a way to simplify the passing of strings
between processes, using<B> atoms</B>.
<P>
An atom is effectively a "handle" to a string that is stored in an area
of shared memory known as an<B> atom table</B>.  Atom tables are maintained
by the operating system, and may be private to a particular process or shared
by all processes in the system.  OS/2 creates a system atom table at system
initialization time, which is accessible by all processes in the system.

<P>
A process may add a string to an atom table, and obtain an atom that may
subsequently be used to access the string.  Atoms that reference strings
in the system atom table may be passed between processes using any of the
methods described in the foregoing sections, and used by another process
to obtain the contents of the string.
<P>
<B>Semaphores</B>
<P>
OS/2 applications may be implemented using multiple threads within one or
more processes.  Within a single process, the OS/2 memory management architecture
provides no memory protection for different threads, and hence multiple
threads may have addressability to the same data areas.  It is important
that the integrity of resources such as common data areas or files, shared
between threads, be protected at all times.  Such resources must be accessed
in a serialized fashion.  Although OS/2 provides no automatic protection
for data resources between threads within a process, OS/2 allows an application
to achieve this serialization of access by using semaphores.
<P>
A semaphore is a data structure that may be "owned" by only one thread at
any time. Semaphores may be used as flags by an application, to indicate
that a data resource is being accessed.  A thread may request ownership
of the semaphore; if the semaphore is already owned by another thread, the
requesting thread is blocked until the first thread releases it.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a number of different types of semaphores, to
be used in different circumstances:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="628_L2_Mutexsemaphore.html"><B>Mutex</B></A> semaphores
provide mutually exclusive access to a particular resource such as a shared
memory object.  These semaphores offer a useful means of synchronizing access
to such resources between different threads or processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="563_L2_eventsemaphore.html"><B>Event</B></A> semaphores
are used to signal system or application events. These semaphores provide
a means of signalling events to other threads or processes, allowing such
threads to suspend their execution and "wait" for a particular event to
occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="629_L2_MuxWaitsemaphore.html"><B>MuxWait
</B></A>semaphores may be used when waiting for multiple events to occur
or multiple mutex semaphores to clear.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Within these semaphore types, OS/2 Version 2.0 provides both <A HREF="678_L2_semaphore.html"><B>private
</B>and<B> shared</B></A> semaphores.  The<I> system semaphores</I> and
<I>RAM semaphores</I> provided by previous versions of OS/2 are also supported,
retaining compatibility with applications developed for previous versions
of the operating system.  Each process in the system may have up to 65535
private semaphores, and there may be up to 65535 shared semaphores in the
system.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a number of operating system functions allowing
the creation and manipulation of semaphores.  Semaphores are discussed in
the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application Design Guide</I>.
