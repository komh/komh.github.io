<P>
A font is a set of alphanumeric characters and other symbols.  Fonts may
be designed interactively using the Font Editor application provided as
part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.  Once a font has
been designed, the Font Editor saves the font in a disk file with an extension
.FNT.  This font file is referenced from the resource script file using
the FONT keyword:
<PRE>FONT     123     MYFONT.FNT
</PRE>

<P>
The integer following the FONT keyword is used to identify the font resource.
 A symbolic name<I> cannot</I> be used to define a font resource.
<P>
A font file must be link-edited along with a resource script file containing
a FONT keyword referencing the .FNT file, and with the FONTS.OBJ and FONTS.DEF
files provided with the<I> OS/2 Programmer's Toolkit</I>, to produce a file
with an extension of .FON.  Although a font cannot be stored in a dynamic
link library, the .FON file may be installed on the system by the user or
installed explicitly by an application.  The font is then usable by any
application in the system.  Alternatively, an application developer may
choose not to install the font, but merely to access it from a particular
application using the<B> GpiLoadFonts()</B> function.
