<H1>Message Definition</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
When the high-level design is complete, the message classes and their contents
must be defined for each action that will be performed on and by an object.
 Note also that the same message class may be used with different object
classes to achieve a different result, in accordance with the principle
of polymorphism, thus reducing the number of defined message classes and
simplifying the design of the application objects and their methods.
<P>
The message classes comprise the interfaces between objects, and provide
the input and output for the methods associated with the object.  These
message interfaces must therefore be documented to facilitate reusability
of the newly-created application objects by documenting the valid inputs
and outputs for each object class, and the behavior of the object in response
to these messages.
<P>
Since the messages received and dispatched by an object constitute the inputs
and outputs required and expected of that object, the documented message
interfaces provide a valuable starting point for developing a test plan
for the object.  Since the inputs, actions and outputs are known, a comprehensive
set of test data may then be formulated to test the methods associated with
each action, with both valid and invalid message inputs.
