<H1>Identifying the Destination Window</H1><!-- entering slot 274 -->
<P>
When passing messages between windows using the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> or<B> WinSendMsg()
</B>functions, the window handle of the destination window must be known
and specified in the message.  If window handles are not defined globally,
the required handle must be obtained from Presentation Manager.  This may
be achieved in a number of ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the target window has a known relationship to the
current window  or to another window for which the handle is already known,
the<B> WinQueryWindow()</B> function may be used to obtain the window handle
of the target window. For example, if a window wishes to post a message
to its own parent window, the technique shown in <A HREF="038_L2_ObtainingaWindowHand.html">Figure
"Obtaining a Window Handle - WinQueryWindow() Function"</A> may be used.

<P>
The<B> WinQueryWindow()</B> call returns the handle of the required  window.
Relationships other than parent/child may also be used by this function;
 the valid relationships are described, along with the<B> WinQueryWindow()
</B>function, in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the parent window and window identifier of the
target window are known, the<B> WinWindowFromID()</B> function may be used
to obtain the window handle of the target window. For example, if a window
wishes to post a message to the client window of its application's main
window, assuming the frame window handle is known, the method shown in <A HREF="039_L2_ObtainingaWindowHand.html">Figure
"Obtaining a Window Handle - WinWindowFromID() Function"</A> may be used.

<P>
The<B> WinWindowFromID()</B> function also returns the handle of the required
window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the target window is the application's main window,
its handle may be obtained by first querying the application's switch entry
in the Workplace Shell Window List to obtain the handle of the main frame
window (using the<B> WinQuerySwitchHandle()</B> and<B> WinQuerySwitchEntry()
</B>functions), then using the<B> WinWindowFromID()</B> function to obtain
the handle of the client window, as shown in <A HREF="040_L2_ObtainingaWindowHand.html">Figure
"Obtaining a Window Handle Using the Switch Entry"</A>.
<P>
The above example assumes that the application has been added to the OS/2
Window List using the<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()</B> function, and the handle
of its main frame window supplied as a parameter.  See <A HREF="026_L2_WinAddSwitchEntryFun.html">Figure
"WinAddSwitchEntry() Function"</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When passing messages synchronously to control windows using the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()
</B>function, it is generally assumed that the target control window is
a child of the current window or dialog box.  Thus the parent window handle
is the handle of the current window, and the window identifier is also known
to the current window procedure.  An exception is the case where a window
procedure wishes to send a message to a frame control of its own parent
frame window.  In this case a<B> WinQueryWindow()</B> call must be issued
with the QW_PARENT parameter to determine the handle of the frame window.
 The<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()</B> function may then be used with this handle
and the window identifier of the required frame control.
