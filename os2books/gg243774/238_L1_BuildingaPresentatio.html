<H1>Building a Presentation Manager Application</H1><!-- entering slot 255 -->
<P>
While the steps necessary to create a Presentation Manager application are
generally similar to those required to create any kind of application in
the programmable workstation environment under OS/2, there are some specific
considerations to be borne in mind with regard to the implementation of
object-oriented concepts in Presentation Manager applications, since the
Presentation Manager environment does not force the application developer
to obey such guidelines.  Therefore, this chapter will discuss the implementation
of the general concepts outlined in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>, in such a way that they conform
to  object-oriented principles and achieve the highest level of modularity.

<P>
For the purposes of discussion, this chapter will assume that the source
code is written using the "C" language. Other programming languages may
be used to create Presentation Manager applications while preserving the
overall application architecture, provided these languages support the creation
of reentrant code and allow recursion.
