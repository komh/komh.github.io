<H1>Destroying an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 309 -->
<P>
A specific instance of an object class can be destroyed by the user, simply
by dragging it over the Shredder object on the Workplace Shell desktop.
 If an object or application wishes to delete an object, it may do so using
the<B> WinDestroyObject()</B> function, as shown in <A HREF="064_L2_DestroyinganObject.html">Figure
"Destroying an Object"</A>.
<P>
The<B> WinDestroyObject()</B> function uses the object handle that is returned
by the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> function.  The object or application that
creates the object is responsible for storing this handle during the existence
of the object.
<P>
When an object is destroyed, the system invokes the object's<I> _wpUnInitData
</I>method, which may be used to free any resources or instance data items
that were allocated to that particular object.
