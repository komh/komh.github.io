<H1>Viewports</H1><!-- entering slot 445 -->
<P>
Information within help windows is displayed in <A HREF="707_L2_viewport.html"><B>viewports</B></A>.
In the default case, a single viewport is defined that occupies the entire
help window and contains the text.  This is known as a <A HREF="681_L2_simpleviewport.html"><B>simple
viewport</B></A>. However, multiple viewports may be defined within the
same help window, and handled separately.  For example, two viewports may
be defined in a help window;  the first may be used to display a graphical
diagram, while the second may contain a text narrative relating to the diagram.
 The user may scroll the text in the window, but the diagram remains displayed
since it lies in a separate viewport.  This type of definition is known
as a <A HREF="529_L2_complexviewport.html"><B>complex viewport</B></A>.

<P>
Multiple viewports are normally defined within a help window using<I> :link
</I>tags which are known as<B> automatic links</B>.  These operate in a
similar manner to hypertext links, but are invoked automatically when the
help window is displayed.  An example of a help window containing such links
is shown in <A HREF="129_L2_MultipleViewportsUsi.html">Figure "Multiple
Viewports Using Automatic Links"</A>.
<P>
The<I> auto</I> attribute specifies that the viewport is to be opened automatically
when its parent help window is opened.  The<I> dependent</I> attribute specifies
that the viewport is to be closed when its parent is closed.  The<I> vpx=</I>,
<I>vpy=</I>,<I> vpcx=</I> and<I> vpcy=</I> attributes specify the position
and size of the viewport within the parent window.  In <A HREF="129_L2_MultipleViewportsUsi.html">Figure
"Multiple Viewports Using Automatic Links"</A>, two viewports are opened,
positioned side-by-side within the parent window.
<P>
The<I> scroll=</I>,<I> titlebar=</I> and<I> rules=</I> attributes determine
whether each viewport possesses its own scroll bars, title bar and sizing
borders.  In <A HREF="129_L2_MultipleViewportsUsi.html">Figure "Multiple
Viewports Using Automatic Links"</A>, neither viewport contains a title
bar or sizing border (both make use of the parent's title bar and border),
but the right-hand viewport contains its own scroll bar.  This allows the
right-hand viewport to be scrolled while the left-hand viewport remains
unchanged.
<P>
<B>IPF-Controlled Viewports</B>
<P>
By default, the presentation of information in viewports is under the control
of IPF, using instructions defined in the source files.  Such viewports
are known as <A HREF="603_L2_IPFcontrolledviewpor.html"><B>IPF-controlled
viewports</B></A>. When an IPF-controlled viewport is used, text is automatically
formatted within the viewport by IPF, and presented in the help window.

<P>
<B>Application-Controlled Viewports</B>
<P>
A viewport may also be defined as an<B> application-controlled viewport</B>,
using the<I> :acviewport</I> tag.  This tag allows an application to take
direct control of a viewport, and to present information in this viewport
in a manner determined by that application.  For example, a full-motion
video application could be used to display information in video format.

<P>
The<I> :acviewport</I> tag is shown in <A HREF="130_L2_ApplicationControlle.html">Figure
"Application-Controlled Viewport"</A>.
<P>
The<I> :acviewport</I> tag causes IPF to load a dynamic link library as
specified in the<I> dll=</I> attribute, and to pass control to the entry
point identified by the<I> objectname=</I> attribute.
