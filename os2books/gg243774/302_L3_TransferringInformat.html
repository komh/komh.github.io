<H1>Transferring Information</H1><!-- entering slot 333 -->
<P>
As explained in <A HREF="301_L3_DroppinganObject.html">Dropping an Object</A>,
a target window may send a DM_RENDER message to the source when it receives
a DM_DROP message from Presentation Manager.  Similarly, a Workplace Shell
object may send the same message when its<I> _wpDrop</I> method is invoked
by the Workplace Shell.  This message is normally sent to the source when
the target requires the assistance of the source in completing the transfer
of data as part of the drop operation.
<P>
The source window processes this message in its window procedure, according
to the rendering mechanism requested by the target.  If the source is a
Workplace Shell object, the Workplace Shell will directly invoke the object's
<I>_wpRender</I> method to perform the same function.  In most cases, however,
an object does not need to override the<I> _wpRender</I> method unless it
wishes to implement a private rendering mechanism.
<P>
The DM_RENDER processing from the<I> Customer</I> program is shown in <A HREF="073_L2_HandlingtheDM_RENDER.html">Figure
"Handling the DM_RENDER Message"</A>.
<P>
The first parameter to the DM_RENDER message contains a pointer to the DRAGTRANSFER
structure, which in turn contains a pointer to the DRAGITEM structure in
its<I> pditem</I> field.  For a Workplace Shell object, a pointer to the
DRAGTRANSFER structure is passed as a parameter to the<I> _wpRender</I> method.

<P>
In the DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism, the<I> ulItemID</I> field in the
DRAGITEM structure is used to hold a pointer to the customer container record
(of type CONTRECORD), in whch the<I> cust</I> field is a CUSTOMER structure
containing details of the customer object which was dragged.
<P>
Next, the name of the shared memory object previously allocated by the target
window is retrieved from the<I> hstrRenderToName</I> field of the DRAGTRANSFER
structure.  This name is used to obtain access to the shared memory object.
 The customer details are copied into this memory object, after which the
memory object is freed.
<P>
The operation code in the DRAGTRANSFER structure is then checked to establish
whether the target requires a copy or a move operation.  If a move was requested,
the source program deletes the customer record from the contaiiner by calling
an application subroutine named<I> RemoveCustomer()</I>.
<P>
The window procedure then returns the value TRUE, indicating that the data
was successfully rendered.  This value is returned to the target window
procedure that issued the<B> DrgSendTransferMsg()</B> call. At this point,
the target window procedure has access to all information required to complete
the drop operation, and may do so without further communication.
<P>
At the completion of the rendering procedure, the source may pass a DM_RENDERCOMPLETE
message to the target, allowing the target to release any resources still
outstanding.  A Presentation Manager window may process this message in
its window procedure, while a Workplace Shell object is notified of the
event by the Workplace Shell, which invokes the object's<I> _wpRenderComplete
</I>method. This is usually only required in cases where complex private
rendering mechanisms involve multiple transfers.  It is not used in the
above examples.
