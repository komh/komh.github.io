<P>
Each object class in the Workplace Shell resides in a dynamic link library.
A programmer creates an object class by defining its characteristics in
a <A HREF="521_L2_classdefinitionfile.html"><B>class definition file</B></A>.
This file is then used as input to the <A HREF="684_L2_SOMPrecompiler.html"><B>SOM
Precompiler</B></A>, in order to produce "C" source code and header files
for the object class. This source code includes basic definitions for the
object class's data and methods; the code is then edited by the programmer
to include the logic for each of the required methods.  Once the code is
complete, it is compiled and link edited in the normal way to produce a
dynamic link library; see <A HREF="382_L1_CompilingandLinkEdit.html">Compiling
and Link Editing an Application</A> for further information on compiling
and link editing.
<P>
When an object class has been created, it must be registered with the Workplace
Shell, which includes the DLL in a list of libraries loaded at initialization
time.  The entry points for the DLL are known to the Workplace Shell, and
may be called in order to invoke the object's methods.
<P>
The process of creating an object class from a class definition file is
described in <A HREF="273_L2_DefininganObject.html">Defining an Object</A>.
