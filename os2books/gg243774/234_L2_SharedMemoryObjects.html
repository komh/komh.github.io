<H1>Shared Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 251 -->
<P>
By default, memory objects allocated by an application are private to the
process in which that application executes.  However, OS/2 allows memory
to be shared among applications for interprocess communication.  Shared
memory objects are allocated in a similar manner to private memory objects,
using the<B> DosAllocSharedMem()</B> function.
<P>
Note that while private memory objects are allocated using addresses upward
from the lower limit of the process address space, shared memory objects
are allocated downward from the upper limit of the process address space.
Hence the private and shared memory arenas grow toward one another as more
memory objects are allocated during execution.
<P>
Shared memory objects may be freed in the same manner as private memory
objects, using the<B> DosFreeMem()</B> function.
