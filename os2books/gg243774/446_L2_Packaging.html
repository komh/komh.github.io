<P>
When a set of application objects and/or subroutines has been created and
placed into a dynamic link library, the following items will have been generated:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The dynamic link library containing the application
objects and/or subroutines<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A header file containing declarations for the routines
that will be called by applications in order to create the application objects
or invoke the subroutines<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->An import library file, containing entry point definitions
for those routines that will be called by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These items must be stored in a location from which application developers
may access them.  The use of a local area network to provide and manage
access to such items is discussed in <A HREF="448_L1_ManagingDevelopment.html">Managing
Development</A>.
<P>
In addition, appropriate entries must be included in an <A HREF="600_L2_InterfaceControlDocu.html"><B>interface
control document</B></A>, which defines all common application objects and
subroutines along with their external interfaces, and acts as a reference
for application developers who wish to use such objects or routines.
