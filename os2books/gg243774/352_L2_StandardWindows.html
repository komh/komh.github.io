<H1>Standard Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 387 -->
<P>
Standard windows are used to display the contents of data objects. The contents
of a data object may, in turn, be comprised of other objects.  For example,
if the data object is a directory on a workstation's fixed disk, its contents
are files, which are themselves objects.  Alternatively, a data object may
contain information in the form of text or formatted data.  Note that  an
object may be defined by the user during execution; for example, if  the
user is editing a text file and selects a block of text to be  operated
upon, then that block of text becomes the scope of the  following series
of actions, and is thus defined as an object.
<P>
By convention, the nature of a user's interaction with a standard window
should be unformatted and modeless; a standard window is used to  display
objects or their contents, from which the user selects an object upon which
to perform one or more actions.  The exact sequence of actions performed
by the user in the window should not be of concern  to the application.
 If a modal or otherwise structured dialog with the  user is required, the
application developer should implement this  dialog as a dialog box.  For
this reason, it is recommended that the  use of control windows be confined
wherever possible to dialog boxes only.  An allowable exception to this
rule is the instance where a standard window displays a list of objects;
 in this case, the client window may be created as a container window or
listbox.
<P>
This is relatively simple for normal listboxes; however, for a listbox with
special display requirements and which is therefore created with the style
LS_OWNERDRAW, the application must subclass the frame window in order to
intercept and process the WM_DRAWITEM messages  which are sent to the listbox's
owner (the frame) whenever a listbox item must be redrawn on the screen.

<P>
A standard window should normally be both sizable and movable on the screen,
allowing the user to configure the visual appearance of the desktop to suit
the tasks being performed.  A standard window should therefore be created
with the FCF_SIZEBORDER style attribute in order to generate a sizing border
for the window.  Similarly, the user should be able to maximize and minimize
the window in order to more clearly display information, unless the logical
requirements of the application scenario dictate otherwise; the standard
window should thus also be created with the FCF_MINMAX style attribute.
 A window that is neither sizable nor able  to be minimized or maximized
is by definition an optimized window, and should be implemented using a
dialog box.
<P>
A standard window should always possess a title bar, to indicate the nature
of the window's contents, and to provide a "handle" for moving the window
on the screen; the frame window should therefore be created with the FCF_TITLEBAR
style attribute.  For  an application's main window, the text displayed
in the title bar should be the same as that displayed in the OS/2 Window
List entry for the application, and should follow the convention "Object
Name - View".
<P>
For child windows containing objects or their contents, the window title
should be the same as the name or identifier of the item in the parent window
that caused the child window to be created.  For instance, the selection
of a "Customer List" entry in the main window of an "Address Book" application
might cause the display of a child window containing a list of customers'
names; the title of this window  would be "Customer List - Details View".
 Since a standard window represents an  object or group of objects, the
title should always be a noun rather  than a verb.
<P>
A standard window is created using the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> or<B> WinCreateStdWindow()
</B>functions. <B> WinCreateWindow()</B> creates the frame and client windows
in separate steps, whereas<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> creates both in a
<!-- entering slot 388 -->single step. A standard window is typically created
with the FCF_SIZEBORDER, FCF_SYSMENU, FCF_TITLEBAR, FCF_MINMAX and FCF_MENU
style attributes specified for the frame window.  See <A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A> for an
illustration of the use of these style attributes.
<P>
If an icon and/or accelerator table will be associated with the window,
the FCF_ICON and FCF_ACCELTABLE style attributes should be specified.  The
icon and accelerator table definitions will then be loaded from the specified
resource file when the window is created.
<P>
If the application does not wish to explicitly size and position a frame
window on the desktop, the FCF_SHELLPOSITION style attribute may be specified.
 Presentation Manager will then determine a default size and position for
the window.
<P>
As an alternative to specifying all of the above attributes, the FCF_STANDARD
attribute may be specified.  This attribute is assumed if the<B> WinCreateStdWindow()
</B>call or the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> call for a frame window contains
no control data.
