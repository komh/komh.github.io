<H1>Function Name Changes</H1><!-- entering slot 409 -->
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, certain function names for operating system kernel
functions and Presentation Manager functions have been changed to provide
improved consistency.  These changes obey the following rules:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The use of the terms<I> Create</I>,<I> Get</I>,<I> Set
</I>and<I> Query</I> in function names is in accordance with SAA conventions,
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>Create</I> implies that a new resource is created
as the result of a function call.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>Get</I> implies that a resource is made available
to the application as the result of a function call.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>Set</I> implies that a system value is changed
as a result of a function call.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>Query</I> implies that a system value or handle
to an existing function is returned as the result of a function call.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Verbs
are placed before nouns in function calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Similar
actions have similar semantics, although they may operate on different types
of resources.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These changes have been made in order to provide improved consistency in
function names, simplifying the task of learning the various function names.

<P>
Applications that use operating system functions should be checked and function
names altered where necessary.  A list of corresponding function names in
OS/2 Version 1.3 and OS/2 Version 2.0 is given in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 -
Volume 1:  Control Program</I>.
