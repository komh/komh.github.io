<H1>Icons, Pointers and Bitmaps</H1><!-- entering slot 342 -->
<P>
As already mentioned, an icon is a graphical representation of an object
on the screen.  For the purposes of discussion, icons, pointers and bitmaps
will be grouped together; a pointer is a graphical image that is associated
with a pointing device such as a mouse, and which moves on the screen as
the pointing device is moved by the user, whereas a bitmap is a graphical
image that typically is used to represent a general item such as a logo.
 Icons, pointers and bitmaps may be designed interactively using the Icon
Editor application supplied as part of the OS/2 Version 2.0 product.  Depending
on which resource is being created, the Icon Editor saves the resulting
icon, pointer or bitmap in a file with an extension of ICO, PTR or BMP.
 These files are then referenced from the resource script file using the
ICON, POINTER or BITMAP keywords:
<PRE>ICON     MAIN     APPLIC.ICO
POINTER  DRAW     PENCIL.PTR
BITMAP   INTRO    LOGO.BMP
</PRE>

<P>
The keyword is followed in each case by a resource identifier, which is
a symbolic name used by the application to identify the resource.  For an
icon, the identifier is used as a parameter to the<B> WinCreateWindow()
</B>and<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> calls, and identifies the icon resource
to be used when the FCF_ICON attribute is specified for the frame window.
 In all cases, the symbolic name must be defined as an integer constant
using a<I> #define</I> statement.
<P>
For a pointer or bitmap, the identifier is used as a parameter to the<B> WinLoadPointer()
</B>or<B> GpiLoadBitmap()</B> functions, which load the resource into memory.
 <B>WinLoadPointer()</B> returns a pointer to the resource in memory, which
may then be used as a parameter to the<B> WinSetPointer()</B> function,
in order to set the desktop pointer to that resource.
<P>
A pointer may be set to one of the system-defined pointer styles (such as
an arrow or hourglass) using the<B> WinSetPointer()</B> function, by obtaining
the handle of the required system pointer using the<B> WinQuerySysPointer()
</B>function as follows:
<PRE>rc = WinSetPointer(HWND_DESKTOP,
                   WinQuerySysPointer(HWND_DESKTOP,
                                      SPTR_WAIT,
                                      FALSE));
</PRE>

<P>
This call will set the pointer for the desktop to the hourglass pointer
(indicated by the symbolic name SPTR_WAIT).  The handle of the hourglass
pointer is returned by the<B> WinQuerySysPointer()</B> call.  The symbolic
names of the various system pointers are described along with the<B> WinQuerySysPointer()
</B>function in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.

<P>
A bitmap is drawn within a window on the screen using the<B> WinDrawBitmap()
</B>function.  The pointer to the bitmap, returned by<B> GpiLoadBitmap()
</B>is passed as a parameter to<B> WinDrawBitmap()</B> in order to identify
the resource.
