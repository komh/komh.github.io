<P>
OS/2 provides the programmable workstation platform for the delivery of
Systems Application Architecture application functionality in the standalone
workstation and cooperative processing environments.  OS/2 overcomes the
limitations of the DOS operating system by providing support for large physical
and virtual address spaces and supporting concurrent execution of multiple
applications with memory isolation and automated task dispatching.  While
enforcing memory protection between applications, OS/2 provides architected
mechanisms to allow interprocess communication and data sharing in a controlled
manner.
<P>
OS/2 also provides compatibility with existing DOS applications, since OS/2
Version 1.3 allows a single DOS application to run using the DOS Compatibility
Box, and OS/2 Version 2.0 allows multiple concurrent DOS applications to
execute in virtual DOS machines.  OS/2 Version 2.0 also supports Microsoft
Windows applications in a similar manner to DOS applications.  This allows
users of OS/2 systems to continue to use their existing DOS and Windows
applications under the new operating system.
<P>
OS/2 also implements dynamic linking, which allows an application developer
to isolate common application services in separate modules known as dynamic
link libraries (DLLs).  Calls to application services provided in a DLL
are resolved at execution time, which means that any modifications to the
routines contained in a DLL do not require any maintenance to applications
using that DLL.  In addition, DLLs are created as re-entrant code, thus
allowing multiple applications to use the same memory-resident copy of the
DLL code and thereby reducing storage requirements.
<P>
OS/2 provides an operating system environment for the programmable workstation
that enables a far greater degree of functionality and sophistication on
the part of application programs.  OS/2 Version 2.0 provides architected
methods for overcoming most of the inherent limitations of the DOS and OS/2
Version 1.3 environments, and providing the workstation user with a higher
level of capability in the workstation.  OS/2 provides the vehicle that
will enable the fulfillment of the Systems Application Architecture cooperative
processing direction.
