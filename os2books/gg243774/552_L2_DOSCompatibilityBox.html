DOS Compatibility Box
<P>
Facility provided by OS/2 Version 1.3 that allows a single real mode (DOS)
application to execute under control of OS/2, occupying the lowest 640 KB
of physical memory.  A real mode application executing in this way may coexist
with other protected mode applications in the same system. Certain restrictions
are imposed on applications executing in the DOS Compatibility Box; an application
may not be a TSR application, nor should it be a time-dependent application
(such as a terminal emulator).  These limitations are overcome by the Multiple
Virtual DOS Machines feature implemented by OS/2 Version 2.0.
