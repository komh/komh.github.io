<H1>Window and Dialog Procedure Names</H1><!-- entering slot 505 -->
<P>
In order to indicate that a particular subroutine within an application
is a window procedure, it is suggested that all window procedure names should
be prefixed with<I> wp</I> in lowercase letters.  Similarly, dialog procedures
for processing modal dialog boxes, should be prefixed with "dp" to identify
the nature of their processing and to differentiate them from normal window
procedures.
