<H1>Message Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 224 -->
<P>
Messages passed to a window may be processed in one of two basic ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Synchronously</I>, in which case the message is
passed directly to the target window and is processed immediately; the window
from which the message originated suspends its execution until the message
is processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Asynchronously</I>, in which case the message is
placed on a queue from which it is subsequently retrieved and passed to
the target window; the window from which the message originated continues
execution immediately after the message is placed on the queue.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Synchronous and asynchronous processing are described in more detail in
<A HREF="215_L3_WindowProcedures.html">Window Procedures (Invoking a Window
Procedure)</A>.
<P>
A message may also be dispatched to multiple windows at the same time, using
the message broadcasting facilities provided by the Presentation Manager
programming interface.  Broadcasting may be either synchronous or asynchronous.
 The implementation of message broadcasting is discussed in more depth in
<A HREF="249_L2_WindowCommunication.html">Window Communication</A>.
<P>
Messages that are not explicitly processed by an application in its window
procedures are passed to a default window procedure supplied by Presentation
Manager, which contains default processing for all message classes (in the
case of application-defined message classes, this default window procedure
simply ignores the message).  This technique is in accordance with the principle
of inheritance, in that a window procedure only contains methods for those
message classes with which it is directly concerned, and allows other messages
to be processed by the existing default window procedure.  Default processing
for each message class is described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation
Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
For message classes that are processed by the application's window procedures,
the last operation in the message processing should be to provide a return
code to Presentation Manager.  In many cases, this return code determines
whether Presentation Manager performs its default message processing, after
the application's own message processing is complete.  The default message
processing may or may not be desirable, depending upon application requirements.
 This ability allows system-initiated events to be easily detected and trapped
by a Presentation Manager, enabling the application to perform its own processing
for the event before allowing the default processing to occur.
