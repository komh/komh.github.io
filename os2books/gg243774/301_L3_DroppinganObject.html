<H1>Dropping an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 332 -->
<P>
When the user drops a dragitem over a Presentation Manager window, the target
receives a DM_DROP message.  The window procedure for the target may process
that message in order to handle the drop operation, and may either complete
the operation or initiate a conversation with the source window or object
in order to do so, typically by sending it a DM_RENDER message, which ultimately
will result in the data being transferred.
<P>
When the user drops a dragitem over a Workplace Shell object, the Workplace
Shell invokes that object's<I> _wpDrop</I> method. The processing of this
method is very similar to that discussed below for the DM_DROP message.
 However, object classes that do not implement private rendering mechanisms
need not override the<I> _wpDrop</I> method; the default processing provided
by the parent class may be allowed to occur.
<P>
In the customer/phone dialler example, the only type of dragitem that the
order program will accept is a customer object, which uses the application-defined
DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism.  The correct data type and rendering mechanism
is verified by the target window procedure during processing of the DM_DRAGOVER
message, so there is no need for further checking when the DM_DROP is processed.
 Note however, that in a more sophisticated application, which supports
multiple data types and rendering mechanisms, it may be necessary to perform
more detailed checking.
<P>
In <A HREF="072_L2_HandlingtheDM_DROPMe.html">Figure "Handling the DM_DROP
Message"</A>, access must first be gained to the DRAGINFO and DRAGITEM structures.
 This is achieved in a similar manner to that already described for the
DM_DRAGOVER message.  Having gained access to these structures, a named
shared memory object is then allocated, into which the source window will
be asked to place the customer details.
<P>
A DRAGTRANSFER structure is then allocated, in which information about the
target's requirements can be passed to the source window.  This structure
is similar to the DRAGINFO structure, in that it must be accessible from
multiple processes.  It is therefore allocated using the<B> DrgAllocDragtransfer()
</B>function, ensuring that the structure will be accessible to the source
window, which may be in another process and therefore not have direct access
to the target's private data areas.
<P>
There are several important fields in this structure.  The target window
procedure places a pointer to the DRAGITEM structure into the<I> pditem
</I>field, thereby enabling the source to identify which item has been dropped.
 The<I> hstrSelectedRMF</I> field is used to identify which rendering mechanism
and data format is to be used for this target, from the selection offered
by the source in the DRAGITEM structure.  The<I> hstrRenderToName</I> field
is used in the DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism to pass the name of the
shared memory object to the source window.
<P>
Once this structure has been completed with the necessary information, it
is sent to the source window as part of a DM_RENDER message.  This message
is passed to the source window using the<B> DrgSendTransferMsg()</B> function.
This function should be used for drag/drop operations in preference to the
<B>WinSendMsg()</B> function since, for a DM_RENDER message, it also grants
access to the DRAGTRANSFER structure for the process that owns the window
to which the message is being sent.
<P>
In processing the DM_RENDER message, the source window copies the customer
details into the shared memory so that when<B> DrgSendTransferMsg()</B> returns,
the target window procedure may extract the data it needs.  A detailed explanation
of the source window's processing of a DM_RENDER message is given in <A HREF="302_L3_TransferringInformat.html">Transferring
Information</A>.
<P>
Upon completion of the information transfer, the entire drag/drop operation
is complete and the data structures allocated during the operation may be
released.  For the DRAGINFO and DRAGTRANSFER structures, this must be carried
out using the<B> DrgFreeDraginfo()</B> and<B> DrgFreeDragtransfer()</B> functions.
