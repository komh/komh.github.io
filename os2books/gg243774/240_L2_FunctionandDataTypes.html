<P>
Presentation Manager provides a number of specialized function and data
type definitions (such as MRESULT, MPARAM, etc.) for use by Presentation
Manager applications.  While these type definitions are not "standard" C
language types, their use is<I> strongly</I> recommended.  OS/2 maps these
type definitions into standard C language types using<I> #define</I> statements
embedded in the OS/2 header file<I> os2.h</I>.  Since the mapping may vary
between OS/2 Version 1.3 and Version 2.0  due to differences between the
16-bit and 32-bit operating system architectures, the use of Presentation
Manager's type definitions insulates the application source code from the
underlying architecture.
