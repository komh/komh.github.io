real mode
<P>
Mode of execution for the Intel 80286 processor, whereby the processor emulates
the operation of an 8086/8088 processor.  In this mode, memory addresses
are made to physical locations in memory, and addressability is limited
to 1 MB.  Real mode is the mode used by the DOS operating system; the design
of this operating system further restricts applications' memory addressability
to 640 KB.
