<P>
A pulldown menu may be used to display a list of options from which one
or more items may currently be selected; for example, a pulldown menu might
provide a list of fonts to be used by a word-processing or desktop publishing
application.  SAA CUA guidelines stipulate that in such a case, the currently
selected item or items within the pulldown menu should be indicated by a
check mark next to the item.  Presentation Manager provides support for
this convention by allowing a check mark to be displayed within the pulldown
menu.  This is achieved using the<B> WinCheckMenuItem()</B> function; <A HREF="108_L2_PlacingaCheckMarkona.html">Figure
"Placing a Check Mark on a Pulldown Menu Item"</A> shows how to place a
check mark next to  the item MI_OPTION1.
<P>
Note that the<B> WinCheckMenuItem()</B> function is new in OS/2 Version
2.0;  previous versions of OS/2 required the use of a<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()
</B>function call to send an MM_SETITEMATTR message to the menu.
<P>
If a checked item is selected for a second time, the check mark should be
removed by the application.  This is achieved by sending the same message
to the menu bar, with FALSE specified for the last attribute in the function
call.
<P>
Note that the use of a check mark in a pulldown menu provides an alternative
to the use of radio buttons or check boxes in simple dialogs. See <A HREF="361_L3_UseofControlWindows.html">Use
of Control Windows</A> for further information.  When a pulldown menu with
a check mark is used to display more than one set of  mutually exclusive
items, each set should be separated by a horizontal  bar in the pulldown
menu.  See <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager
Resources</A>.
