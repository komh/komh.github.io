<H1>Compiler Options</H1><!-- entering slot 430 -->
<P>
Using the IBM C Set/2 compiler, the following command sequence is recommended:

<PRE>cc /C+ /L+ /G3 /Ti+ MYPROG
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> /C+</B> option indicates that only the compile step should be run,
and not the link-edit step, which is then performed explicitly at a later
point using the LINK386 utility.  The<B> /L+</B> option causes the compiler
to produce a source listing file.
<P>
The<B> /G3</B> option optimizes the code for execution on an Intel 80386
processor.  The code will also execute on an 80486 processor.  However,
for code that will mainly be executed on 80486 hardware, use of the<B> /G4
</B>option is recommended.  See the<I> IBM C Set/2 User's Guide</I> for
further information.
<P>
The<B> /Ti+</B> option instructs the compiler to generate symbolic debugging
information which may then be used when debugging the application with the
IBM C Set/2 debugging tool.
