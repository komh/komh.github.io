<P>
It can be seen from the foregoing discussion that the object-oriented paradigm
is a logical consequence of the move toward data-centered application design.
 An object-oriented approach provides many benefits for applications which
manipulate data, not the least of which is the ability to implement an intuitive,
event-driven user interface where the user manipulates a number of conceptual
objects in a metaphorical manner that mirrors the "real-life" manipulation
of those objects.
<P>
It should be stressed however, that object-oriented programming is not necessarily
suited to all applications; its use is recommended only where data is the
central factor in the application's task.  There may be situations where
the procedure, rather than the data, is necessarily the focus of the application,
or where an event-driven style of user interface is not appropriate to the
task being performed.  In such cases, traditional structured programming
techniques hold advantages over object-oriented programming.  However, in
situations where only a portion of the work task is procedurally oriented,
it is possible for the two approaches to coexist within the same application.

<P>
Object-oriented programming focuses on the principles of data abstraction
and encapsulation, with all access to a data object being controlled by
the application object which "owns" that data object.  This principle allows
the object-oriented approach to facilitate the creation of reusable application
objects, since the interface to an object is defined only by the messages
it receives and dispatches.  The implementation details of the data objects
or methods belonging to an application object are typically transparent
to other application objects.  Thus the effects of changes to these data
objects or methods may be contained within a single application object,
easing the task of change management and application maintenance.
<P>
A distinction must also be drawn between an object-oriented application
design and an event-driven, object-action user interface.  The two concepts
are complimentary in that the provision of a truly event-driven interface
for the end user is dependent upon the application being designed and implemented
according to object-oriented principles.  However, while the two concepts
are complimentary, they are not identical and the difference must be borne
in mind when designing an application.
<P>
Object-oriented application design begins with a definition of logical data
entities and their representations (data objects) in the system.  Once these
data objects are defined, the actions relevant to each may be determined,
and the design of the messages to convey each action and the methods necessary
to achieve the actions may be undertaken.  The definition of messages and
actions completes the high-level design of the application, and traditional
functional decomposition techniques may then be applied to designing and
developing the individual methods.  The independent nature of application
objects and of the methods within an object facilitates modularization of
the application, and allows the design, development and testing of the methods
for each object to take place independently of the methods for other objects.

<P>
A number of programming languages and tools exist which implement object-oriented
programming practices to varying degrees.  These may exist in the form of
object-oriented extensions to an existing programming language, or as complete
programming languages in their own right.  The degree to which these products
enforce object-oriented practices also varies from one product to the next.
 It should be stressed however, that the implementation of object-oriented
techniques in application design and development is not dependent upon the
use of any particular tool or programming language, but rather depends on
the correct application of object-oriented design concepts.  When such concepts
are correctly applied in the design of an application, it is quite possible
to develop object-oriented applications in conventional programming languages
such as "C".  The difference<!-- entering slot 216 --> lies in the amount
of latitude given to the individual application developer with respect to
the interpretation of object-oriented principles.
<P>
It may be argued with some justification, that according to many popularly-accepted
definitions, the techniques offered in this chapter do not constitute a
truly object-oriented application model.  However, such concepts as a full
inheritance hierarchy are not directly supported by execution environments
such as Presentation Manager, and are difficult to provide without the use
of additional object-oriented programming tools.  It must be stressed that
the methodology outlined herein is not intended to be a purist implementation
of the full object-oriented paradigm, but is intended to illustrate the
application of certain object-oriented principles to the design and implementation
of Presentation Manager applications, in accordance with the module-based
approach to object-oriented programming.
<P>
These principles, when applied to the Presentation Manager environment,
afford significant enhancements in the areas of code reusability and application
modularity, and subsequent benefits with respect to reduced development
time and effort, and easier application maintenance and change management.
Additional tools may be utilized to apply further object-oriented principles
to Presentation Manager application design, in order to achieve the benefits
associated with a class-based approach to object-oriented programming. However,
such tools typically have additional drawbacks that must be weighed against
their advantages, with regard to the specific development scenario.
