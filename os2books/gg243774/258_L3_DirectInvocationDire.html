<P>
This type of subroutine corresponds to the "conventional" subroutine call,
in that a parameter list is passed to the subroutine from the calling routine,
and a number of parameters and/or a return code is returned at the end of
the subroutine's execution.  Within an object-oriented application, such
subroutines should be used to perform processing that is limited in scope
to a single application object (such as an SQL query on a database owned
by the application object), or to perform a standard processing function
that is common to a number of objects, but where the scope of each execution
instance is limited to a single object.  For example, a function<I> DrawCircle
</I>may be called by a number of window procedures to display a circular
graphics primitive; however, each invocation of the function is from a single
window procedure.
