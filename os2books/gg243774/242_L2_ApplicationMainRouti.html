<H1>Application Main Routine</H1><!-- entering slot 259 -->
<P>
A sample application main routine is illustrated in <A HREF="024_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 1) - Registration"</A> and <A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A>. The functions
performed by the main routine are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Register the application to Presentation Manager,
and obtain an anchor block handle (that is, an application handle), using
the<B> WinInitialize()</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a message queue, into which Presentation
Manager will place all messages intended for the application, using the
<B>WinCreateMsgQueue()</B> function and passing both the anchor block handle
and the required queue size to Presentation Manager, which returns a message
queue handle to the application.  Note that if the queue size specified
is zero (as shown in the example above) then the default queue size of 10
messages is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Register one or more window classes, for the
windows that will be created by the application, and associate a window
procedure with each window class, using using the<B> WinRegisterClass()
</B>function.  Parameters passed to this function include the name of the
window class and the name of the window procedure to be associated with
the class.  Presentation Manager returns a Boolean value indicating success
or failure.  Note the 4 bytes (32 bits) requested for window words, which
may be used by the window procedure to store the address of its instance
data block.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a main display window for the application,
using two consecutive<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> calls (as shown in <A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A>) or a single
<B>WinCreateStdWindow()</B> call.  Note the separate handles used for the
frame and client windows. The values specified for<I> fcdata.flCreateFlags
</I>control the appearance of the window, the controls it contains and its
position on the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Optionally, create an entry for the application
in the Workplace Shell Window List, using the<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()</B> function.
 Note that this step is omitted from <A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A> for reasons
of clarity, and is shown separately in <A HREF="026_L2_WinAddSwitchEntryFun.html">Figure
"WinAddSwitchEntry() Function"</A>.
<P>
Note that under OS/2 Version 2.0, the<B> WinCreateSwitchEntry()</B> function
is provided in addition to the<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()</B> function. These
two functions accept identical parameters and carry out identical tasks;
the<B> WinCreateSwitchEntry()</B> function is intended to provide consistent
function naming conventions.  The<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()</B> function is
retained under OS/2 Version 2.0 for compatability with existing applications,
but use of the<B> WinCreateSwitchEntry()</B> function is recommended.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Establish a message processing loop, whereby
the application requests Presentation Manager to supply messages from the
system queue and subsequently invokes Presentation Manager to dispatch them
to the appropriate window procedure. This loop uses nested<B> WinGetMsg()
</B>and<B> WinDispatchMsg()</B> calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Upon receivng the special message class WM_QUIT,
which will cause<B> WinGetMsg()</B> to return false and hence terminate
the<I> while</I> loop, remove any remaining windows using the<B> WinDestroyWindow()
</B>function, remove the application's entry from the Window List using
the<B> WinRemoveSwitchEntry()</B> function, destroy the message queue and
deregister the application before terminating.  These latter functions are
achieved using the<B> WinDestroyMsgQueue()</B> and<B> WinTerminate()</B> calls.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The structure of the main routine is similar for both the application (that
is, the application's primary thread) and any secondary threads created
by the application.  See <A HREF="323_L1_MultitaskingConsider.html">Multitasking
Considerations</A> for further discussion on secondary threads.
<P>
In <A HREF="024_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure "Sample Application
Main Routine (Part 1) - Registration"</A>, note the use of the EXPENTRY
keyword in the function prototype to specify the<I> system</I> linkage<!-- entering slot 260 --> convention
for the window procedure<I> wpMain</I>.  This is required whenever declaring
a window procedure or dialog procedure, since such procedures are normally
invoked by Presentation Manager on the application's behalf, rather than
directly by the application.
<P>
If the application is to appear in and be selectable from the Workplace
Shell Window List, the main routine must issue a<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()
</B>function call, after creating the application's main window and before
entering the message processing loop. [Note that under OS/2 Version 2.0,
use of the<B> WinCreateSwitchEntry()</B> function is recommended, for reasons
of consistency in function names. ] This function call is shown in <A HREF="026_L2_WinAddSwitchEntryFun.html">Figure
"WinAddSwitchEntry() Function"</A>.
<P>
Note that the application may set the<I> swTitle</I> field of the<I> SwitchData
</I>structure to NULL.  Presentation Manager will then determine the title
under which the application was started from the Presentation Manager shell,
and use this title for the switch entry.
<P>
The<B> WinAddSwitchEntry()</B> function returns a switch entry handle, which
may be stored by the application and used during termination to remove the
switch entry from the Workplace Shell Window List using the<B> WinRemoveSwitchEntry()
</B>function.
<P>
The switch entry may be accessed by a window procedure at any time during
application execution.  The switch entry handle is obtained using the<B> WinQuerySwitchHandle()
</B>function, and the<I> SwitchData</I> control structure may then be obtained
using the<B> WinQuerySwitchEntry()</B> function, and altered using the<B> WinChangeSwitchEntry()
</B>function.  This capability may be used to allow a window procedure to
obtain the handle of the application's main window, in order to post or
send messages to that window.  This is discussed in <A HREF="254_L3_IdentifyingtheDestin.html">Identifying
the Destination Window</A>.
