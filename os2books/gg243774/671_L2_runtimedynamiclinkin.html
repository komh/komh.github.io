run-time dynamic linking
<P>
Form of dynamic linking whereby modules and resources are loaded into memory
during application execution, by the application issuing a<B> WinLoadModule()
</B>function call.  Run-time dynamic linking is typically used for portions
of the application code that are rarely required (such as fatal error handling
routines); they are therefore explicitly loaded into memory when needed.
 In this way, the memory requirements of the application may be reduced.
