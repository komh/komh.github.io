<H1>Suballocating Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 249 -->
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, the granular unit of memory is the page. This means
that the minimum possible memory allocation for a single<B> DosAllocMem()
</B>function call is 4KB.  For example, if an application requests the allocation
of 10 bytes of storage, the operating system will allocate a full 4KB page;
the remaining storage in this page will be wasted.
<P>
It is therefore recommended that for dynamic allocation of small memory
objects for uses such as instance data, each window procedure should use
a single<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call to allocate a storage pool,
and subdivide this storage as required using the<B> DosSubAlloc()</B> function,
as shown in <A HREF="022_L2_SuballocatingMemory.html">Figure "Suballocating
Memory"</A>.
<P>
Storage must be suballocated in multiples of 8 bytes.  Any requested suballocation
which is not a multiple of 8 bytes will have its size rounded<I> up</I> to
a multiple of 8 bytes.
<P>
Storage to be suballocated must first be allocated using the<B> DosAllocMem()
</B>function, and initialized for suballocation using the<B> DosSubSet()
</B>function.  Note that control information for the suballocation uses
64 bytes of the storage pool; this must be taken into account when determining
the size requirements for the pool.
<P>
In <A HREF="022_L2_SuballocatingMemory.html">Figure "Suballocating Memory"</A>,
the storage in the pool is committed during allocation, since the example
assumes that the total storage requirement is known in advance. In situations
where the exact size of the storage required is not known, the storage may
be allocated but not committed, and the suballocation procedure will then
progressively commit storage as required.  This is indicated by specifying
the DOS_SPARSE_OBJ flag in the<B> DosSubSet()</B> function call.
<P>
Memory that has been suballocated using the<B> DosSubAlloc()</B> function
may be freed using the<B> DosSubFree()</B> function.  The storage is then
available for future suballocation.  Note, however, that the suballocation
procedure does not reorganize suballocated memory objects within a pool.
 Thus freeing objects within the pool may result in memory fragmentation.

<P>
A storage pool initialized for suballocation using the<B> DosSubSet()</B> function
should be removed using the<B> DosSubUnset()</B> function before the memory
in the pool is freed.  This function call releases the operating system
resources used by the suballocation procedure.
<P>
When using the C Set/2 compiler, the<B> malloc()</B> function may be used
to allocate memory.  This function has many of the advantages of the<B> DosSubAlloc()
</B>function, but avoids the need for the application to explicitly allocate,
set and suballocate memory.  The<B> malloc()</B> function also provides
greater independence for application code from the platform upon which it
executes, allowing the application to be more easily migrated to platforms
other than OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
The<B> malloc()</B> function works as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The first call to<B> malloc()</B> from a particular
application (process) causes<B> malloc()</B> to request a memory object
from the operating system. The<B> malloc()</B> service routine adds 16 bytes
to the size specified in the function call, and rounds the result upward
to the next even power of 2.  This amount of memory is then requested from
the operating system using a<B> DosAllocMem()</B> call.  The operating system
will then allocate memory, rounding the service routine's request size upward
to the nearest multiple of 4KB.  The<B> malloc()</B> function then fulfills
the application's request, with some wastage due to the page-granular allocation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->For subsequent calls to<B> malloc()</B>, the<B> malloc()
</B>service routine first checks whether it has sufficient memory remaining
from a previous request; if so, it allocates that memory and returns control
to the application.  If not, the service routine requests additional memory
from the operating system using the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that the<B> free()</B> function, used to free memory which has been
allocated using<B> malloc()</B>, does not return the memory to the operating
system; rather, that memory is held by<B> malloc()</B> for future use.  In
order to return memory to the operating system, the application must issue
a<B> heapmin()</B> function call.
