<H1>Search for Existing Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 207 -->
<P>
Once the data objects and the set of actions required for each object have
been defined, the application designer should determine the existence of
any previously-created application object classes for that type of data
object.  The use of existing application objects, with additional actions
and methods handled through subclassing, can significantly reduce the amount
of coding required.
<P>
The accurate identification of existing application object classes requires
that each application object, upon completing its final testing, must be
placed in an object library, and its external interfaces (both input and
output) must be fully documented and placed in a retrieval system from which
the object's description may be recalled by designers of future applications.
 The organization and level of sophistication of such a system is largely
at the discretion of the development organization, but becomes more crucial
as the number of application objects grows larger over time.  It is strongly
recommended that any organization embarking on a strategy of object-oriented
application development should adopt an efficient object library management
system from the outset.
