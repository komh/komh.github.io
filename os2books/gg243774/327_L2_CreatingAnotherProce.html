<H1>Creating Another Process</H1><!-- entering slot 361 -->
<P>
Each application running under OS/2 typically resides in its own  process,
and therefore has its own address space.  Resources created by  or allocated
to a process are normally private to that process.  If  required for application
purposes, this process may in turn create one  or more additional processes
to perform part of the application's processing.  Additional processes  may
be created in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->As a child process of the creating process, in which
case the child process will automatically terminate upon termination of
the creating process.  Such processes are started using the<B> DosExecPgm()
</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->As a separate process, in which case the process will
not automatically terminate when its creator terminates, and must be explicitly
terminated either by its creator or by another process in the system. Such
a process is started using the <B> DosStartSession()</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When an application uses multiple processes, it is usual for the first process
to be regarded as the "primary" process for the  application, and for other
processes to be started as children of this  process.  This is conceptually
similar to the use of primary and  secondary threads.
<P>
It is therefore conventional to use the<B> DosExecPgm()</B>  function to
start a child process.  This function is illustrated in <A HREF="087_L2_StartingaChildProces.html">Figure
"Starting a Child Process"</A>.
<P>
The window handle of the window from which the<B> DosExecPgm()</B>  call
is made, is passed to the child process as an argument, using the  the fourth
parameter of the<B> DosExecPgm()</B> function.  This  enables the child
process to post a message to its parent upon  completing its initialization,
indicating the window handle of its own  window.  In this way, communication
via Presentation Manager messages may be  established in both directions.

<P>
Note that since the fourth parameter to the<B> DosExecPgm()</B>  function
is defined as an ASCII string, the window handle is converted  to its ASCII
equivalent before the call is issued.  The main routine of  the child process
subsequently converts the handle back to its true  form.
<P>
Use of the EXEC_ASYNCRESULT flag in the<B> DosExecPgm()</B> call  causes
the operating system to save the termination codes of the child  process
so that they may be examined at a later point by the parent  process, using
a<B> DosWaitChild()</B> function call for  synchronization purposes (see
<A HREF="104_L2_DosWaitChildFunction.html">Figure "DosWaitChild() Function"
</A>for further information).
<P>
The process ID of the child process is returned by the <B> DosExecPgm()
</B>function as part of the RESULTCODES structure  in the sixth parameter.
This value should be stored by the parent  process, since it is used if
and when the parent process needs to  terminate the child at some later
point during execution.
