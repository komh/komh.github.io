<P>
This chapter provides a brief overview of some concepts involved in object-oriented
application design and programming, and the way in which this approach differs
from traditional top-down functional decomposition. It is not intended as
an indepth analysis of object-oriented programming, since such a task is
beyond the scope of this document, but serves merely to provide a background
against which the implementation of object-oriented principles under Presentation
Manager may be discussed.
