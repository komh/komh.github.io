<H1>IPF Tag Language</H1><!-- entering slot 441 -->
<P>
The IPF tag language is similar in structure and syntax to the Generalized
Markup Language (GML) used by IBM's Document Composition Facility* (DCF*)
product.  Source files are simple ASCII text files, and can be created using
any normal text editor.
<P>
Tags are embedded in the files simply by inserting the tag into the text
at the required point.  For example, this document was created and formatted
using GML tags, and the opening sentences of this chapter were created using
the format shown in <A HREF="123_L2_IPFTagLanguageExampl.html">Figure "IPF
Tag Language Example"</A>.
<P>
Note that the chapter heading is preceded by a "header level 1" tag which
causes the header text to be formatted in a particular manner.  Similarly,
the header is followed by a "paragraph" tag which caused a new paragraph
to begin.  The formatting of the text within the source file is not significant;
there is no requirement for a tag to begin at the left margin, or for each
tag to begin on a separate line.  A developer may organize the source files
in the most appropriate manner for readability.
<P>
The first statement in a source file must be a<I> :userdoc</I> tag, and
the last statement must be a<I> :euserdoc</I> tag.  These tags are required
by IPF.  Comments may also be imbedded within a source file using the<I> :*
</I>tag; comments are ignored by the IPF  compiler, and do not appear in
the formatted text.
<P>
A complete description of the formatting tags available under the IPF tag
language is beyond the scope of this document.  Some examples are given
in the remainder of this chapter, and each tag is described in detail in
the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Information Presentation Reference</I>.
