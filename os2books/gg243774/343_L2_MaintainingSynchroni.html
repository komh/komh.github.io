<H1>Maintaining Synchronization</H1><!-- entering slot 378 -->
<P>
It is the responsibility of the application to ensure the  appropriate level
of synchronization between threads or process accessing resources.  Assuming
the  convention suggested in <A HREF="326_L3_ThreadsWithoutObject.html">Threads
Without Object Windows</A>, it is only necessary to  indicate when a secondary
thread or process has completed processing a  particular unit of work.  This
may be achieved in a number of ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By having the secondary thread or process post a completion
message  to the calling window procedure before terminating<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By using an event semaphore in conjunction with the
Presentation Manager timer facility<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By using the<B> DosWaitThread()</B> function in the
case of  threads<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By using the<B> DosWaitChild()</B> function in the
case of  processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
While it is possible, when using object windows in secondary threads or
separate processes, to ensure synchronization by using the <B> WinSendMsg()
</B>call for synchronous processing of the target  window procedure, this
method is<I> not</I> recommended since it  prevents the calling window procedure
from processing additional user  input, and is thus potentially in violation
of SAA CUA guidelines.  In addition, immediate invocation of a window procedure
in this way may  disturb the natural sequence of message processing and
compromise the  user's intention.
