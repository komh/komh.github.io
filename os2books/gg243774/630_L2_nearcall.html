near call

Under the segmented memory model, a program call to a routine located within
the same memory segment. Such a call provides only the offset of the routine
within the segment; a segment address is not needed since all application
code is assumed to reside in the same memory segment.  By default, C programs
compiled using the small or compact memory models generate near calls.  See
also <A HREF="570_L2_farcall.html">far call</A>.
