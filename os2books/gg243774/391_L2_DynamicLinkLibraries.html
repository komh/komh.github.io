<P>
Since window procedures that communicate using the standard Presentation
Manager message conventions have no exterior interfaces aside from these
messages, window procedures are essentially "black boxes" and are invisible
to the application.  It is thus possible to produce a number of window procedures
to perform standard or often-used functions, and to store these window procedures
in a library from which they may be accessed by a number of applications.

<P>
The recommended way to achieve this capability is to place such window procedures
in an OS/2 dynamic link library. [See <A HREF="185_L2_DynamicLinking.html">Dynamic
Linking</A> for an explanation of the concept of dynamic linking. ] Applications
using these window procedures then reap the benefits of DLLs; namely that
changes to window procedures contained in the DLLs do not require the applications
to be re-linked and that multiple applications may use the same memory-resident
copy of the window procedure code, since DLLs are re-entrant.  The use of
DLLs therefore maximizes the potential for code reuse, and facilitates the
containment of change within a single application module.
<P>
Note that where existing 16-bit DLLs contain application objects, functions
or resources required by 32-bit applications under OS/2 Version 2.0, these
applications may access the 16-bit DLLs.  This technique, known as mixed
model programming, is discussed in <A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing
16-Bit and 32-Bit Application Modules</A>.
