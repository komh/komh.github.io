<H1>Compiling C Source Code</H1><!-- entering slot 428 -->
<P>
The following files are required to generate a system object model object
class or Presentation Manager application from "C" source code:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Source</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> An application may contain one or
more source modules; multiple source modules are normally bound at link-edit
time.  However, application routines may be compiled and placed in a DLL
for binding at execution time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> H</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> An
application may use a header file that contains data type definitions, constants
and macro definitions for use by the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DEF
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL>A <A HREF="623_L2_moduledefinitionfile.html"><B>module
definition file</B></A>, while not required for all Presentation Manager
applications, is definitely recommended.  This file contains information
for input to the link editor, as described in <A HREF="387_L3_ModuleDefinitionFile.html">Module
Definition File</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> RC</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> A
resource script file contains definitions for Presentation Manager resources,
and/or statements that include resources from other files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DLG
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL>If an application uses a dialog box, a dialog
file is normally created containing a definition for the dialog box and
its control windows.  This file is normally included into the resource script
file using an appropriate statement.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The role of these files in the development of a Presentation Manager application
is illustrated in <A HREF="120_L2_CompilingandLinkinga.html">Figure "Compiling
and Linking an OS/2 Presentation Manager Application"</A>.
<P>
Note that certain additional header files are generated by the SOM Precompiler
and used in compiling a system object model object class.  These files are
typically header files used to link the class with its parent, and have
no direct bearing on the compilation process.
<P>
The following steps are required to compile and link-edit a Presentation
Manager application:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Compile the source file using a high-level language
compiler, to produce an object file (usually with an extension of .OBJ).
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Link-edit the object file with any other required
object files, and possibly one or more run-time libraries, to create an
executable file (usually with an extension of .EXE).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Compile any Presentation Manager resources using
the resource compiler, and incorporate these resources into the application's
executable code or place them in a DLL module.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
A number of compiler and link editor options are specified for Presentation
Manager applications; these are shown in the example below.  The executable
file may then be run as a Presentation Manager application under OS/2.
<P>
Note that the third step above is not required if Presentation Manager resources
are not used by the application.  However, it is envisaged that virtually
all Presentation Manager applications will make some use of resources, due
to the benefits to be gained through externalization of logic-independent
or language-specific application components.
<P>
Note that the command sequences for compiling and link editing an application
may be combined and placed in a parameterized OS/2 command file for automated
execution.  Alternatively, a<B> makefile</B> may be created and the NMAKE
utility used to compile and link edit the application.
