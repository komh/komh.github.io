<H1>Terminology</H1><!-- entering slot 496 -->
<P>
In the subsequent discussion of configuration and library management, the
following terminology will be used.  The term <A HREF="508_L2_applicationresource.html"><B>application
resource</B></A> will be used to indicate a particular development resource
such as a source module (along with its supporting include file), a custom-developed
dynamic link library (that is, a dynamic link library not taken from a group
of generic library modules), a Presentation Manager resource such as an
icon or dialog definition etc., which is specific to the current application.
 Other development resources such as compilers, link-editors, programmers'
toolkits, generic code libraries and so on, may be used in the development
of an application, but are not considered to be application resources.
<P>
The term <A HREF="657_L2_productionlevel.html"><B>production level</B></A> will
be used to indicate a version of an application resource that has been created,
tested and approved for placement in a production library.  The process
of testing and subsequent approval for placement in a production library
is called <A HREF="511_L2_baselining.html"><B>baselining</B></A>.
<P>
The term <A HREF="705_L2_userlevel.html"><B>user level</B></A> will be used
to indicate a version of an application resource that is currently undergoing
modification, and has not been either tested or placed in a production library.
 The actual transfer of an application resource from a developer's local
work library to a production library is called <A HREF="659_L2_promotion.html"><B>promotion</B></A>.
