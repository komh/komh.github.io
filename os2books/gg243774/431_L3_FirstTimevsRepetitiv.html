The third important step in documenting a problem is to determine whether
the error occurs<I> every</I> time a particular action is performed, or
if it only occurs after the action has been performed a number of times.

Problems that occur after a number of repetitions of an action typically
indicate a resource limitation being exceeded, and provide a short-cut to
problem resolution; see <A HREF="435_L3_RepetitiveActionProb.html">Repetitive
