<P>
The steps required in compiling and link-editing a Presentation Manager
application are generally similar to those required to generate any other
OS/2 application. Some files are required in addition to those used by a
"conventional" application, due to Presentation Manager's use of externalized
definitions for application resources such as menus, string tables and dialog
boxes.
<P>
The module definition file provides a mechanism whereby various attributes
of an application or dynamic link library may be specified.  The module
definition file also allows the developer to specify copyright information
that is imbedded in the executable code.
<P>
The creation of dynamic link libraries, while essentially similar to that
of normal application code, requires certain special considerations, notably
with regard to the module definition file and the options that are specified
at link-edit time.  Code modules and Presentation Manager resources that
are likely to be subject to change, or are of a potentially reusable nature
may be placed in dynamic link libraries and thus isolated from the remainder
of the application.  The remainder of the application code is thus protected
from changes that may be necessary to these dynamic link libraries in order
to accommodate changes in such areas as organizational procedures or government
legislation.  Dynamic link libraries may also be used by multiple applications
concurrently, by virtue of their reentrant nature.
