<H1>First Time Problems</H1><!-- entering slot 476 -->
<P>
Problems that occur whenever a program statement is executed indicate an
error in that statement or in a parameter used by that statement.  These
errors may often be indicated by the nature of the error.  Some common errors
are given below.
<P>
<B>Trap 000D</B>
<P>
This error indicates that the program attempted to access a location in
memory that was not within the area allocated to its parent process.  Since
such access might violate the integrity of other applications or of the
operating system itself, OS/2 disallows the access.  Note that the pointer
may directly reference a memory location, or may be the handle to a resource
such as a window, presentation space etc.
<P>
The usual cause of such an error is that a pointer passed as a parameter
in a function call is incorrect.  The pointer may not have been initialized,
or may have been set to an incorrect value as a result of a failed allocation
request or incorrect pointer arithmetic.
<P>
Resolution actions are typically as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Check that the function call which allocated the resource
referenced by the pointer completed without error, and that a valid pointer
was returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure that any pointer arithmetic carried out on
the pointer between allocation and the failing program statement is error-free.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the pointer is stored in an instance data area
(that is, a data block normally stored in the window words), ensure that
the pointer to the instance data area itself has been correctly read from
the window words at the start of processing for the<I> current</I> message.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The allocation of a Presentation Manager resource may also fail for reasons
associated with its parent window.  See Failure to Allocate Resources below.

<P>
One additional cause of this error is the application releasing an instance
data block too early in the processing of a WM_DESTROY message.  If the
memory object containing this data block is released, and the application
then attempts to release other resources whose handles are contained within
the data block, OS/2 will not allow access to the memory.  This problem
is easily resolved by releasing the instance data block after other resources.

<P>
<B>Trap 000E</B>
<P>
This error indicates that an application under OS/2 Version 2.0 attempted
to access an area in memory for which an address range had been allocated,
but no storage committed.  This error typically occurs when writing data
objects into application data areas, since most operating system and Presentation
Manager resources are automatically committed upon allocation.
<P>
The usual cause of such an error is that the application failed to include
the PAG_COMMIT flag in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call that allocated
the resource, or failed to issue a<B> DosSetMem()</B> call when increasing
the size of a memory object.  The problem may be easily resolved simply
by including the PAG_COMMIT flag or including a<B> DosSetMem()</B> call
to ensure that sufficient storage is available before writing to a memory
object.
<P>
<B>Failure to Allocate Resources</B>
<P>
A common error shows itself when Presentation Manager resources cannot be
allocated correctly by an application.  This occurs most frequently with
resources allocated upon creation of a window, during processing of the
WM_CREATE message.
<P>
The cause of the error is a failure, on the part of the application, to
complete the default processing of the WM_CREATE message,<I> before</I> carrying
out application-specific processing.  Part of this default processing involves
the allocation of a Presentation Manager control block for the window, allocation
of a window handle etc.  If this processing is not performed, via a<B> WinDefWindowProc()
</B>function call, at the commencement of processing for the WM_CREATE message,
function calls which use parameters such as the window handle will fail.

<P>
The problem may be easily resolved by placing a<B> WinDefWindowProc()</B> function
call as the first statement in the processing for the WM_CREATE message.

<P>
<B>Stack Space Exceeded</B>
<P>
This error may appear in either of two places:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If it appears during a call to an application subroutine,
it usually indicates that the space reserved for the application'<!-- entering slot 477 -->sstackisinsufficientforthenumberofnestedfunctioncalls
,localvariables ,etc . ,beingusedbytheapplication .<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If it appears during a call to an operating system
or Presentation Manager function, it may indicate the same cause as above,
or that the limit of the application's Ring 2 stack, used by system-level
code invoked by the application, has been exceeded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The application's stack size may be exceeded in situations where the application
makes a large number of nested subroutine calls, particularly where extensive
recursion is used, and/or where large numbers of local variables are defined.
 In such cases, the stack may be need to be increased beyond the recommended
minimum of 8KB, using the STACKSIZE statement in application's module definition
file.
<P>
The Ring 2 stack limit is normally exceeded only in situations where a system-level
function attempts to retrieve more items from the stack than were originally
placed there.  This can occur where an application passes an incorrect parameter
to a function; for example, if a parameter is declared by the function as
an array of eight elements, but the application passes an array containing
only seven elements, an error may occur when the function attempts to retrieve
eight elements from the Ring 2 stack for processing.
<P>
While such an error may reveal itself during compilation, certain C typecasting
conventions may mask the problem until run time.  Where this error occurs
during execution, careful checking of parameters is recommended.
<P>
<B>Window Fails to Appear</B>
<P>
This error occurs when an application issues a<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> or
<B>WinCreateStdWindow()</B> function call to create a display window, but
the window fails to appear on the desktop, even though the function returns
a valid window handle.  This error may result from either of two causes:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The WS_VISIBLE flag may not be set in the frame creation
flags for the window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The application may include the FCF_ICON or FCF_ACCELTABLE
frame creation flags, but no icon or accelerator table resources are defined
with resource identifiers which match the window identifier.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
In both cases, the<B> WinCreateWindow</B> or<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> function
will return a valid window handle, since the window has been created.
<P>
In the first case, the problem may be rectified by including the WS_VISIBLE
flag in the frame creation flags, or by using the<B> WinShowWindow()</B> function
to explicitly make the window visible.
<P>
In the second case, resources should be defined in the application's resource
script file to match the FCF_ICON and FCF_ACCELTABLE frame creation flags.
 These resources must have identifiers that match the window identifier
given in the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> or<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> calls,
since Presentation Manager uses this identifier to load the resources.
