<H1>Creating a Secondary Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 357 -->
<P>
In <A HREF="213_L2_ApplicationStructure.html">Application Structure</A>,
it is mentioned that an application must  create its own input message queue
to process messages intended for its windows.  The Presentation Manager
message-handling implementation creates message queues on a per-thread basis,
and thus requires that any thread that creates a window (whether that window
is a display window or an object window) and processes messages must have
its own message queue.
<P>
The primary thread of an application is typically a user interface  thread
that handles processing for display windows on the screen; this  thread
creates the application's main message queue and processes  messages caused
by user interaction.  The primary thread may also  create a secondary thread
to deal with messages that cause lengthy  processing to be carried out,
leaving the primary thread free to  respond to user input.  A secondary
thread may be created in one of two  ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> _beginthread()</B> function provided by the
C compiler should be used to create secondary threads that will contain
object windows, or that contain code which calls C run-time library functions.
 This function maintains certain internal C library control data that is,
by default, not maintained by the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function provided by
OS/2 may be used to create secondary threads that will not contain object
windows, and that do not call C run-time library functions.  The<B> DosCreateThread()
</B>function offers a  slight performance advantage over the<B> _beginthread()
</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The<B> _beginthread()</B> function is used since it establishes  internal
semaphores to serialize access to the run-time library's  global data and
non-reentrant library functions, transparently to the  calling application.
The<B> _beginthread()</B> function also  maintains information for each
thread, such as the exception handling  environment and the calling address
for reentrant functions.  Since  window procedures are reentrant, use of
<B>DosCreateThread()</B> in such situations may cause execution errors.

<P>
Whenever a thread is created, a<B> thread information block</B>  (<B>TIB</B>)
is created by the operating system. The TIB contains information such as
the thread ID, priority and stack size.  This information may be accessed
by the application using the<B> DosGetInfoBlocks()</B> function.  This function
also returns a pointer to information on the thread's parent process, which
resides in the<B> process information block</B> (<B>PIB</B>). The<B> DosGetInfoBlocks()
</B>function is described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program
Reference</I>.
