<P>
Presentation Manager facilitates the implementation of an event-driven,
object-action user interface and provides predefined constructs that enable
a consistent, intuitive user interface for multiple applications, in line
with the objectives of the Systems Application Architecture Common User
Access  component.  However, in order to gain the fullest benefit from such
an interface, the application developer must adopt a certain degree of object-oriented
principles in the design and implementation of applications.
<P>
In order to support the implementation of an event-driven interface and
facilitate the incorporation of object-oriented design techniques, Presentation
Manager provides an object-based, event-driven execution environment with
an application architecture that conforms closely to object-oriented theory,
within the framework of the Systems Application Architecture  Common Programming
Interface.  Windows become the handles by which the application references
data objects, and windows communicate with one another and with the user
in an event-driven manner.  With the addition of the Workplace Shell in
OS/2 Version 2.0, the user and the programmer may deal directly with objects
and take full advantage of the concept of inheritance.
<P>
Benefits to be gained from the adoption of such principles include enhanced
opportunity for code reuse with consequent reductions in development costs,
and easier containment of change through encapsulation and data isolation.
As the programmable workstation becomes more widely utilized as the platform
for line-of-business applications, the importance of sound software engineering
principles in the design and implementation of workstation applications
will increase, in accordance with the requirement to be able to adequately
manage and maintain these applications.  OS/2 and Presentation Manager together
with the Workplace Shell, which extends the paradigm to further exploit
object-oriented concepts, provide a platform for the implementation of such
principles.
<P>
It must be emphasized that Presentation Manager provides an application
architecture at the operating system level which supports the implementation
of certain object-oriented software engineering principles, and provides
many of the facilities required by such an approach.  However, while Presentation
Manager supports an object-oriented approach to application design, it does
not<I> force</I> the application developer to conform to object-oriented
design practices. Presentation Manager does not provide, nor does it seek
to provide, a complete development environment for object-oriented applications;
 the provision of such function is the responsibility of application-enabling
products that may reside and execute in the Presentation Manager environment.

<P>
The remainder of this document will further explore the relationship between
OS/2 Version 2.0, Presentation Manager and object-oriented programming,
and examine the techniques by which object-oriented applications may be
implemented in the Presentation Manager environment, using both the Presentation
Manager and Workplace Shell application models.
