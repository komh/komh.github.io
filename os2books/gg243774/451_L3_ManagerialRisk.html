<H1>Managerial Risk</H1><!-- entering slot 494 -->
<P>
Managerial risk is somewhat more complex than technological risk, since
it involves the effective administration of and control over the use of
new technologies. While it is possible to train or employ development personnel
in order to gain the required skills in the use of new technologies, it
is less easy to obtain the managerial skills necessary to ensure the maximum
benefit is gained from their use.
<P>
Like technological risk, managerial risk may also vary from the relatively
simple to the highly complex.  Some examples of managerial risk are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Transformation of new analysis techniques into application
design specifications<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Establishment of effective control procedures for
a new development environment<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Measurement of programmer productivity when using
a new programming tool or language.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The managerial risk arises not from the question of whether sufficient skills
are present to utilize new technologies, but from the question of whether
managerial personnel are sufficiently well-versed in the concepts underlying
these technologies to provide effective administration and control over
the use of the technologies, in order to ensure that maximum benefit is
gained from their use.
<P>
Managerial risk may be mitigated by ensuring that managerial personnel possess
a sufficient grounding in the principles underlying new technologies, in
order that they may successfully adapt existing managerial techniques to
the administration and control of the new technologies. These skills may
be acquired in a similar manner to the technological skills required by
programmers, through training and familiarity with the technologies involved.
 The decision must be made as to whether the benefit to be gained from the
use of these technologies is sufficient to offset the time and effort involved
in acquiring the necessary skills and establishing the managerial techniques
to effectively control their use.
<P>
Managerial risk may also be mitigated by reducing the associated technological
risk.  For example, a new technology such as object-oriented programming
principles can be implemented using tools such as the C programming language
and Presentation Manager.  There is likely to be a higher degree of familiarity
with such tools in the development organization than with tools such as
C++ or Smalltalk V.  Therefore, implementation of object-oriented principles
may be more effectively controlled by the application of established managerial
techniques for C application development.  While this will not eliminate
the element of risk altogether, it will significantly reduce the managerial
risk involved, and also help to mitigate the technological risk by facilitating
effective control over the development process.
