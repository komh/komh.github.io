<H1>Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 484 -->
<P>
Object windows may be created and placed into dynamic link libraries in
a similar manner to that already explained for display windows.  However,
object windows have an additional complication in that they are frequently
created in secondary threads in order to handle long-running application
tasks.
<P>
The steps in creating an object window for inclusion in a DLL are therefore
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The window procedure, the calling routine to
create the window and a routine to start the secondary thread from which
the window is created, are written in the normal manner, as described in
<A HREF="325_L3_ThreadsContainingObj.html">Threads Containing Object Windows</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The routine containing the code to start the
secondary thread is declared as an exportable entry point, and may thus
be called by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The source code is compiled and link edited as
described in <A HREF="392_L3_CreatingaDLL.html">Creating a DLL</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that the routine called by the application does not return the handle
of the newly created window.  Indeed, it cannot do so, since the creation
of the window takes place asynchronously, in a secondary thread.
<P>
This obstacle is overcome by having the calling application (typically a
window procedure) pass its own window handle as a parameter.  This is passed
to the object window, which then passes an acknowledgement message to the
calling window procedure, containing its window handle.  The calling window
procedure may subsequently communicate with or subclass the object window
as required.  This technique is described, along with an example, in <A HREF="325_L3_ThreadsContainingObj.html">Threads
Containing Object Windows</A>.
