<H1>Communication Between Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 314 -->
<P>
Objects communicate with one another in order to convey events and initiate
actions on the part of other objects.  Such communication is typically initiated
in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By an object to convey information to another object
with which it has an application-defined relationship, such as a request.
 This is similar to the<I> application-initiated</I> event discussed for
Presentation Manager applications in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By the user directly manipulating the objects' icons.
 For example, dropping one icon over another icon initiates a conversation
between the two objects.  This is similar to the<I> user-initiated</I> event
discussed for Presentation Manager applications in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each of these types of communication is discussed in the following sections.
