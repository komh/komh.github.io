<P>
Application errors that only reveal themselves after an action has been
performed many times typically result from the application exceeding an
operating system or Presentation Manager resource constraint.  Resources
such as window handles, presentation spaces, memory objects and so on, have
finite limits. If an application repeatedly requests allocation of such
resources without releasing them, these limits may be exceeded, in which
case the resource will not be allocated and the application may fail when
attempting to use the resource.
<P>
Such problems may manifest themselves as Trap 000D errors that will result
in application termination, or may simply corrupt execution of the application.
 The effect is dependent upon the (invalid) contents of the resource handle
when the application issues a function call that uses the resources.  In
certain cases, a function call may cause the application to enter an endless
loop within the processing of one message, in which case the entire Presentation
Manager desktop may "lock up".
<P>
This problem may be avoided by ensuring that all resource requests (<B>DosGet...()
</B>and<B> WinGet...()</B> function calls) in the code are matched by corresponding
<B>DosRelease...()</B> and<B> WinRelease()</B> function calls.  In accordance
with the principle of encapsulating function, resources required for processing
a particular message should be allocated, used and released during the processing
of that message.
<P>
An exception to this rule occurs in the case of resources such as control
blocks, presentation spaces for display windows, etc.  These are typically
allocated during processing of the WM_CREATE message, and persist throughout
the life of the window, until released during processing of the WM_DESTROY
message.
