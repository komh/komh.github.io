<P>
This type of subroutine occurs with window procedures that are invoked synchronously
via a<B> WinSendMsg()</B> call.  The message is processed, and the return
code from the window procedure is routed to the calling routine by Presentation
Manager.  The calling routine then completes its execution.  If any queued
messages are generated by the called window procedure or subroutine, these
messages are not processed until the calling routine completes its execution
and  the application issues its next<B> WinGetMsg()</B> call.  This is  so,
even if the called window procedure or subroutine executes in a  separate
thread.
<P>
This type of invocation should be used for access to another application
object, where the function to be performed must be executed  synchronously
and the result returned directly to the caller.  However,  use of the<B> WinSendMsg()
</B>call in preference to the <B> WinPostMsg()</B> call for communication
between objects may  result in messages being processed out of order due
to the application pre-empting the normal order of execution determined
by the message  queue.  The<B> WinSendMsg()</B> function should thus be
used with care.  The use of this call may also extend the time interval
between successive<B> WinGetMsg()</B> calls to Presentation Manager, thus
decreasing the application's responsiveness to user interaction.
