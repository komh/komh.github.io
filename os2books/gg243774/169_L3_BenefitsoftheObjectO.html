<H1>Benefits of the Object-Oriented Approach</H1><!-- entering slot 175 -->
<P>
A fundamental benefit of an object-oriented approach from the viewpoint
of the end user is the ability for an application to behave in a manner
that parallels a typical human being's natural approach to problem solving.
 The flexibility of the object-action interface allows scope for individual
variation in the approach to a particular work task.  However, such a user
interface relies upon an object-oriented application implementation in order
to allow such flexibility.  Such an implementation is in turn dependent
upon the correct design approach, which must begin with a focus upon the
entities that affect the application, rather than upon the procedures to
be performed upon those entities.
<P>
The object-oriented paradigm also encourages the concept of data abstraction
and encapsulation, whereby the definition of and establishment of access
to data objects is achieved from within the application object. Ideally,
all access to and manipulation of a data object is carried out from within
a single application object, thereby facilitating change management and
application maintenance.
<P>
Another great benefit of the object-oriented approach is the increased potential
for creation of reusable code.  The independent nature of application objects
enables them to be coupled together in various ways to achieve desired results,
with the internal implementation details of each object and its data structures
being isolated from the other objects with which it communicates.  Applications
that manipulate existing data objects may therefore be assembled from a
number of existing application objects, thus reducing the time and effort
required to develop the application.
<P>
This potential for object reuse has also given rise to one of the great
criticisms levelled at the object-oriented approach; the "myth" of the completely
generic object.  Due to the impracticability of foreseeing all possible
actions that might be performed on a data object, it is impossible to produce
a complete set of methods for that object.  Hence an application object
might require modification at some stage in its life cycle, and is not truly
reusable.
<P>
The object-oriented approach overcomes this potential problem by the use
of a concept known as <A HREF="690_L2_subclassing.html"><B>subclassing</B></A>,
whereby a new application object is created comprised of a data object and
a number of new or modified methods which act upon that object.  Messages
destined for the original application object are diverted to the new object;
 the original object is said to have been<I> subclassed</I>.  If the message
is of a type with which the new object is explicitly concerned, it processes
the message using its own methods.  If not, it passes the message on to
the original object for processing.  In the subclassing process, neither
the sending object nor the original receiving object should be aware that
subclassing has taken place.  Subclassing therefore provides a transparent
means for modifying or adding to the behaviour of an existing application
object without modifying the object itself.

apply to the Presentation Manager environment, are explored more fully in
