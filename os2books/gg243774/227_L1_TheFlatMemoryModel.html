<H1>The Flat Memory Model</H1><!-- entering slot 243 -->
<P>
The task of dynamically allocating memory within an application is greatly
simplified in the 32-bit OS/2 Version 2.0 environment through use of the
flat memory model. The application developer need no longer be concerned
with the maximum 64KB segment size imposed by the 80286 processor architecture.
 Larger amounts of memory may be allocated and subsequently manipulated
as single units known as <A HREF="612_L2_memoryobject.html"><B>memory objects</B></A>,
rather than as multiple segments as was the case with previous versions
of OS/2.  This reduces application complexity, facilitating improved performance
and reducing application development time.
<P>
This chapter describes the use of the flat memory model for application
programming, in order to allocate and manipulate system memory.  The chapter
also examines the facilities provided by OS/2 Version 2.0 that enable applications
to handle memory protection exceptions.
<P>
The concept of the flat memory model is described in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0
- Volume 1:  Control Program</I>.  The functions necessary to manipulate
memory from within applications are described in detail in the<I> IBM OS/2
Version 2.0 Control Program Reference</I>.
