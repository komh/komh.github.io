<H1>Using 16-Bit Window Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 419 -->
<P>
A 32-bit application may access window procedures that reside in 16-bit
modules, either statically linked or as DLLs.  However, the differences
between addressing schemes require some consideration on the part of the
developer, since both the window handles and any pointers passed as message
parameters will differ in their representation.
