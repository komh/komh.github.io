<H1>Object-Action Interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 174 -->
<P>
For the purpose of discussion within this document, an object-oriented application
will also be defined as one that implements an event-driven, object-action
user interface such as that specified in the<I> IBM Systems Application
Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User Interface Design</I>.  With such
an interface, a user first selects an object to manipulate, then selects
one or more of a defined set of actions to be performed upon that object.
 The sequence of these actions, and hence the sequence of the dialog with
the user, is controlled by the user rather than by the application, where
this is possible within the requirements of the work task being performed.

<P>
The concepts of object-oriented design and an object-action user interface
are distinct but complementary.  While it is possible to design and create
an object-oriented application without an object-oriented user interface,
it it far more difficult to implement a truly event-driven, object-action
style of user interface without embracing, at least a certain degree, the
object-oriented approach to design and implementation.  It thus follows
that the SAA CUA user interface model cannot be fully implemented without
some measure of adherence to object-oriented design principles.  It is the
provision of an intuitive, event-driven user interface that constitutes
one of the great strengths of the object-oriented paradigm.
