<H1>The Presentation Manager Application Model</H1><!-- entering slot 217 -->
<P>
The Presentation Manager environment lends itself to the implementation
of object-oriented programs under the module-based approach to object-oriented
design.  Presentation Manager provides far more than merely a means of displaying
information on the screen.  It implements an event-driven, object-based
application execution environment and provides many services required for
the definition and manipulation of application objects and messages.
<P>
This chapter will examine the execution environment provided by Presentation
Manager, describe the structure of a Presentation Manager application, and
illustrate the implementation of basic object-oriented concepts in the Presentation
Manager environment.
