<H1>Presentation Manager Application Model</H1><!-- entering slot 176 -->
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, Presentation Manager provides far more than
merely the ability to achieve a windowed, graphical user interface for the
display of information on the screen.  Rather, Presentation Manager provides
a message-driven, object-based execution environment that facilitates the
provision of an event-driven, object-action user interface, and supports
the implementation of object-oriented design techniques.
<P>
Presentation Manager enables the implementation of an object-action user
interface by providing an application programming interface that conforms
to the guidelines laid down in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture
Common Programming Interface Presentation Reference</I>, and a set of underlying
system services that support an object-oriented, event-driven application
model.  The Presentation Manager programming interface provides user interface
constructs which conform to CUA  guidelines.  However, it must be strongly
emphasized that the term "presentation interface" is a misnomer, since Presentation
Manager is concerned with far more than merely the display of information
on the screen.
<P>
The Presentation Manager application model is centered around the concept
of <A HREF="709_L2_window.html"><B>windows</B></A>. While a window typically
appears as a rectangular area on the screen, it is in fact a "handle" to
a data object; a window concerned with data being displayed on the screen
is termed a<B> display window</B>, whereas a window concerned with an internal
data object is known as an <A HREF="634_L2_objectwindow.html"><B>object
window</B></A>. Each window belongs to a <A HREF="710_L2_windowclass.html"><B>window
class</B></A> and is associated with a <A HREF="712_L2_windowprocedure.html"><B>window
procedure</B></A>, which contains the definition of the window's data object(s)
and also contains methods to perform all of the processing associated with
that window.  Windows and their associated window procedures communicate
with the user and with each other, by the use of messages that are routed
to the appropriate window by Presentation Manager.
<P>
Since a window procedure may contain all the processing related to a particular
data object, along with the definition of and establishment of access to
that data object, Presentation Manager provides a suitable environment for
data encapsulation and abstraction, in that the internal representation
and workings of a data object may be "hidden" within the window procedure
that "owns" the data object.  Provided the external interfaces (that is,
the message formats) of the window procedure remain unchanged, other window
procedures within an application are insulated from changes to the data
object or its processing.  This provides a powerful tool for the enhancement
of application modularity and the containment of change within an application.
 This in turn facilitates the task of application maintenance and change
management, since affected application modules may be easily identified.

<P>
A close corellation may be drawn between the concept of an application object
and that of a window under Presentation Manager. The window becomes the
identity of, or "handle" to an object; the data referenced by the window
(whether a display space on the screen or a data file) becomes a data object;
 the window procedure associated with a window contains the methods to act
upon that data object; and actions to be performed by the application object
on its data object are conveyed by way of messages routed to the window
by Presentation Manager.  Although Presentation Manager provides window
classes to allow grouping of objects with similar characteristics, a full
inheritance hierarchy is not supported, and thus Presentation Manager conforms
more closely to the module-based theory of object-oriented design than to
the class-based approach.  Development tools such as Smalltalk V/PM** are
available to extend the Presentation Manager application model and facilitate
implementation of a full inheritance hierarchy.
<P>
The Presentation Manager application model, along with the underlying OS/2
environment, affords the ability to store an application object (that is,
a data object definition, along with the methods associated with that data
object, contained within a window procedure) in a library that may be dynamically
linked with an application.  This in turn provides the potential to develop
and implement applications composed of one or more generic objects linked
by a custom-built application harness, which allows applications to be<!-- entering slot 177 --> assembled
more quickly and at less cost.
<P>
The Presentation Manager programming interface includes a mechanism for
<A HREF="690_L2_subclassing.html"><B>subclassing</B></A> a window, whereby
messages destined for a particular window may be transparently diverted
to another window for specialized processing. Implementing an application
using generic objects with subclassing to provide specialized methods may
greatly reduce the amount of coding required, and consequently reduce the
development time and cost of applications.
<P>
The general implementation of and support for object-oriented programming
principles under Presentation Manager is discussed further in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.  The subject is examined in
more detail, and specific examples are discussed, in <A HREF="238_L1_BuildingaPresentatio.html">Building
a Presentation Manager Application</A>.
