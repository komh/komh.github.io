<H1>Object-Oriented Concepts</H1><!-- entering slot 197 -->
<P>
Object-oriented application design places the focus of an application on
the logical entities or<I> objects</I> (typically items of data) upon which
a program will operate, and attaches procedures or routines to manipulate
these objects.  A logical data <A HREF="561_L2_entity.html"><B>entity</B></A> (such
as a group of records) may have multiple representations within the system.
 Each of these representations is known as a <A HREF="539_L2_dataobject.html"><B>data
object</B></A>, and each data object may have a finite set of <A HREF="498_L2_action.html"><B>actions
</B></A>performed upon it. The data object itself, along with the routines
(known as <A HREF="618_L2_method.html"><B>methods</B></A>) used to perform
these actions, are together regarded as an <A HREF="507_L2_applicationobject.html"><B>application
object</B></A>.
<P>
Note that in the remainder of this document, the term <A HREF="539_L2_dataobject.html"><B>data
object</B></A> will be used to denote a particular representation (for example,
on the screen or in a disk file) of a logical data entity. The term <A HREF="507_L2_applicationobject.html"><B>application
object</B></A> will be used to denote the conjunction of a data object and
its methods.  While these terms are not in general use, they will be used
here in order to provide a distinction between a data item, and the conjunction
of that data item and the routines that act upon it.
<P>
Application objects typically respond to<B> events</B>, which originate
outside the object and which may be system-initiated or user-initiated.
 The sequence of these events determines the sequence of operations within
the application, and the progression of dialog between the application and
the user, rather than the application determining the sequence of the dialog,
as is traditionally the case.  Such an object-oriented application environment
is thus said to be <A HREF="562_L2_eventdriven.html"><B>event-driven</B></A>.

<P>
Events are communicated to an application object by means of a series of
defined <A HREF="614_L2_message.html"><B>messages</B></A>, which are<I> not
</I>considered to be part of the objects between which they are passed.
 The focus of the program thus becomes the object, rather than the procedure,
and the program becomes a flow of messages between cooperating objects.

<P>
Actions on a data object should be possible<I> only</I> by sending messages
to the associated application object; an object's methods should not be
directly accessible from another object, nor should the behavior of an object
be dependent upon any external source other than the messages it receives.
 A message should also specify only the action that is to be carried out,
and not the way in which it is to be accomplished.  It is the responsibility
of the receiving object to determine the way in which to carry out a requested
action.  Consequently, the behavior of an application object may differ,
depending upon the class and content of its input messages.  A corollary
of this statement is that the result of passing the same message class may
vary, depending on the target object class and its interpretation of that
message.  These guidelines outline the concept of <A HREF="647_L2_polymorphism.html"><B>polymorphism</B></A>.

<P>
One of the primary properties of an application object is its modularity;
objects that obey the foregoing rules should be largely independent of one
another, and the implementation of one object should not be dependent upon
the internal details of another.  Data belonging to an application object
should be accessible only by that object;  requests for access by other
objects should be made via appropriate messages sent to the application
object that "owns" the data object.  Thus the only information necessary
to use an application object is a knowledge of the messages it can receive
and operate upon (through its methods).  This rule encompasses the principle
of <A HREF="560_L2_encapsulation.html"><B>encapsulation</B></A>, which states
that a data object should be defined, created and/or accessed solely from
within its "owner" application object.
<P>
Since a number of application objects may exist with similar characteristics,
such objects are usually grouped into <A HREF="633_L2_objectclass.html"><B>object
classes</B></A>. A class consists of those objects that share similar properties
and methods.  An object class is typically associated with a single data
object or type of data object, and<!-- entering slot 198 --> has a defined,
finite set of methods associated with it.  It is the class that normally
defines the messages and methods applicable to an object.  Each object belonging
to a particular class is then known as an <A HREF="598_L2_instance.html"><B>instance
</B></A>of that class.  Each instance inherits data objects and values defined
for its class, and may also contain its own data, known as <A HREF="599_L2_instancedata.html"><B>instance
data</B></A>; the properties of instance data are typically obtained from
the definition of the object class, but the values are defined uniquely
by each instance.
<P>
The object-oriented approach is most suited to situations where the purpose
of the application is the manipulation of data, whether on the screen or
in a data file, and where the exact sequence of actions is not critical,
provided all necessary actions are carried out.  The focus of an object-oriented
application is the data objects that are being manipulated; the functions
to be performed are subordinate to the data objects upon which they will
act. In addition, the event-driven user interface places the user in control
of the sequence of actions, and provides flexibility with respect to the
way in which the desired result is achieved.
<P>
An advantage of the object-oriented design approach for data manipulation
applications is that a particular data object is "owned" by one application
object, and that the definition of and establishment of access to that data
object is achieved from within the application object.  Since application
objects may be made relatively independent of one another, other objects
may be isolated from changes to the data structure.  This greatly simplifies
application maintenance, since all necessary changes need only be made within
a single object.
<P>
Note that since application objects are closely related only to their associated
data objects, and not to the applications from which they are accessed,
it follows that application objects may be constructed for each data object,
and accessed from multiple applications.  An application need not be aware
of the internal workings of an application object, but need only know the
correct type and format of the messages through which to interact with the
object.  Thus the object-oriented approach facilitates code reusability.
