<P>
In certain circumstances, a window procedure may wish to indicate an  event
to multiple windows, and therefore need to pass the same message  to each
of these windows.  Presentation Manager provides the capability for a message
 to be broadcast to multiple windows with a single<B> WinBroadcastMsg()
</B>function call.
<P>
The<B> WinBroadcastMsg()</B> function passes a message of a specified class
to the descendants of a specified parent window, as shown in <A HREF="041_L2_WinBroadcastMsgFunct.html">Figure
"WinBroadcastMsg() Function"</A>.
<P>
The example shown in <A HREF="041_L2_WinBroadcastMsgFunct.html">Figure "WinBroadcastMsg()
Function"</A> passes a message of the application-defined class WMP_MYMESSAGE
to all children of the current window (that is, the window associated with
the window procedure in which the function call is made), with message parameters
as shown.  The message is posted to the target windows via a message queue,
and is thus processed asynchronously; the<B> WinBroadcastMsg()</B> function
also allows for synchronous processing using the BMSG_SEND flag.
<P>
The parent/child hierarchy allows windows to be grouped in particular ways
to suit application requirements.  For example, all the  object windows
created by an application may be created as children of  a "dummy" master
object window.  If a particular message must then  be sent to all these
object windows (for example, to close all the  windows), this can be done
by broadcasting the message to all children  of the master object window.

<P>
The BMSG_DESCENDANTS flag may be set in the<B> WinBroadcastMsg()</B> call
to cause a message to be passed to all descendants of the specified parent
window, rather than just the direct children of that parent.  This enables
a message to be broadcast  to a wider target group, should the application
so require.  Alternatively, the BMSG_FRAMEONLY flag may be set, causing
the message  to be passed only to frame windows.  This is useful in situations
where  an application wishes to initiate an action by multiple display windows
 at the same time.
<P>
The<B> WinBroadcastMsg()</B> function must be used with caution,  particularly
when it may cause messages to be sent to windows created  by other applications.
 This is possible if the BMSG_DESCENDANTS flag  is set and the desktop window
is specified as the parent, and may cause  complications in other applications.
 For example, consider the  following message definitions:
<PRE><B>Application 1</B>

#define     WMP_REFRESH     WM_USER+12

<B>Application 2</B>

#define     WMP_CLOSEALL    WM_USER+12
</PRE>

<P>
In the example above, each application defines a message class, and each
message is to be used for a different purpose.  However, both messages have
the same message identifier.  Now let us assume that Application 1 makes
the following function call:
<PRE>rc = WinBroadcastMsg(HWND_DESKTOP,
                     WMP_REFRESH,
                     mp1,
                     (MPARAM)0,
                     BMSG_POST);
</PRE>

<P>
This function call would cause a WMP_REFRESH message to be passed to all
display windows in Application 1<I> and</I> Application 2.  However, the
windows in Application 2 would interpret the message as a WMP_CLOSEALL message,
with possibly undesirable results.
<P>
It is therefore strongly recommended that developers exercise extreme care
in using the<B> WinBroadcastMsg()</B> function, in order to accurately determine
the potential results of the messages being broadcast.
