<H1>Window Closure</H1><!-- entering slot 264 -->
<P>
A window is closed (removed from the screen and destroyed) by Presentation
Manager in response to the application issuing a<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> call,
specifying the handle of the window to be destroyed.  In normal circumstances
the handle of the frame window is specified; destroying the frame window
destroys that window and all of its children, including the client window
associated with that frame.
<P>
When an application requests that Presentation Manager close a window, a
system-defined message of class WM_DESTROY is sent to the client window,
and thus to the window procedure associated with that class.  The window
procedure may capture and process this message, backing out any uncompleted
units of work, and destroying or terminating access to data objects.  The
window procedure should then return a value of zero.
<P>
Note that although closing and destroying a parent window will also close
and destroy all children of that window, the WM_DESTROY message is sent
to the parent window, and processed before the children are destroyed.  Hence
when processing a WM_DESTROY message, a window procedure may assume that
all its children still exist.
<P>
If the user explicitly requests closure of a window by selecting the  "Close"
option on the system menu, a system-defined message of  class WM_CLOSE is
sent to the window procedure.  The window procedure  may also capture and
process this message in a similar manner to that  used for WM_DESTROY messages.

<P>
Note that explicit processing of the WM_CLOSE message class is recommended
for<I> all</I> Presentation Manager windows, since the default processing
provided by Presentation Manager causes a WM_QUIT message to be posted to
the application's message queue. This may result in unwarranted termination
of the application.  The window procedure for a child window should process
a WM_CLOSE message by issuing a<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> call for its frame
window.  The window procedure for an application's main window should process
a WM_CLOSE message by posting a WM_QUIT message to itself.  This will cause
the application to terminate (see <A HREF="263_L2_TerminatinganApplica.html">Terminating
an Application</A>).
<P>
In order to handle the closure of a window in the most elegant manner, the
following course of action is recommended:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Explicit processing should be provided for both WM_CLOSE
and WM_DESTROY messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A window procedure should process a WM_CLOSE message
by issuing a<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> call for its own frame window if
it is a child window, or a WM_QUIT message to itself if it is an application's
main window.  In both cases, the window procedure should then return a value
of zero.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A window procedure should process a WM_DESTROY message
by closing any files or databases that it has opened, and freeing any resources
such as memory objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Selection
of the "Exit" option from a menu bar should result in the closure of the
window to which the menu bar belongs, by  having the window procedure issue
a<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> call for its frame window. If the window is
the application's main window, it should be closed by having the window
procedure post a WM_QUIT message to itself (see <A HREF="263_L2_TerminatinganApplica.html">Terminating
an Application</A>). This will result in a WM_DESTROY message being posted
to the main window and each of its children as part of the application's
termination processing.  These messages may be captured and processed by
the appropriate window procedures in order to close data objects, back out
incomplete units of work, etc.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
