<H1>Inheritance Hierarchy</H1><!-- entering slot 287 -->
<P>
Each object class is descended from another class, known as its <A HREF="642_L2_parent.html"><B>parent
class</B></A>. Since the system object model supports the object-oriented
concept of inheritance, a class may inherit data and methods from its parent
class, which in turn may inherit data and methods from<I> its</I> parent,
and so on.  A class which inherits properties from other classes is therefore
known as a <A HREF="540_L2_descendant.html"><B>descendant</B></A> of those
classes, and the classes from which it inherits are known as <A HREF="502_L2_ancestor.html"><B>ancestors</B></A>.
The implementation of inheritance in the Workplace Shell means that when
creating a new object class, a programmer simply subclasses the parent class,
and need only define those characteristics that are not defined by, or are
different from those of the parent class.  This greatly simplifies the process
of creating a new object class.
<P>
Under the system object model, every object class is a descendant of the
base class<I> SOMObject</I>.  This class defines the basic characteristics
and behaviors common to all objects in the system.  Other object classes
are subclasses of this class.  The system object model provides two additional
classes,<I> SOMClass</I> and<I> SOMClassManager</I>, to form the basis of
an inheritance hierarchy. The Workplace Shell extends this hierarchy by
creating a number of classes of its own, based upon the<I> SOMObject</I> class.
These Workplace Shell object classes define the characteristics of the object
types that are defined and implemented by the Workplace Shell itself.
<P>
The inheritance hierarchy implemented by the Workplace Shell is illustrated
in <A HREF="043_L2_WorkplaceShellInheri.html">Figure "Workplace Shell Inheritance
Hierarchy"</A>.
<P>
As well as being descended from the system object model base inheritance
hierarchy, all Workplace Shell object classes are descended from one of
three <A HREF="512_L2_basestorageclass.html"><B>base storage classes</B></A> defined
by the Workplace Shell. These classes are so named because they directly
influence the storage of control information and instance data for the class.
 The three predefined base storage classes are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>WPAbstract</B>, which is the base class for abstract
objects such as programs, devices, etc., and for which control information
is stored in the system initialization file OS2.INI<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>WPFileSystem</B>, which is the base class for objects
that are stored as files in the file system, and for which control information
is stored in the file system as extended attributes<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>WPTransient</B>, which is the base class for objects
that only exist during execution of a particular program; that is, the object
is created and used for a particular purpose during processing, and then
immediately deleted from the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
An application developer may extend the Workplace Shell inheritance hierarchy
by introducing new object classes based upon those already implemented by
the Workplace Shell itself.  Indeed, the developer may even introduce new
base classes, although this is definitely a non-trivial exercise and should
be approached with caution.
