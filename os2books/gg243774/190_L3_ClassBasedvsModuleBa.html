<H1>Class-Based vs Module-Based</H1><!-- entering slot 200 -->
<P>
The notion of object classes, and the extent to which this concept is taken,
provides the distinguishing factor between two primary schools of thought
within the object-oriented paradigm.  Under a <A HREF="519_L2_classbased.html"><B>class-based
</B></A>approach, objects are defined in terms of their class, and each
class is defined in terms of other previously defined classes, the properties
and methods of which are automatically conveyed upon the new class;  this
is known as the principle of <A HREF="595_L2_inheritance.html"><B>inheritance</B></A>.

<P>
For example, the object class "horse" may be defined as a sub-class of the
object class "quadruped", with the additional properties of being able to
be ridden and eating grass.  A further object class "pony" may then be defined
as being a sub-class of the class "horse", with an additional upper limit
on size.  While this is a somewhat frivolous example, it illustrates the
principle that an object class is defined in terms of other object classes,
and need only explicitly define those properties and methods that are unique
to that object class.  All other properties and methods are inherited from
its parent class or classes.  This introduces the concept of an <A HREF="596_L2_inheritancehierarchy.html"><B>inheritance
hierarchy</B></A>, in that an object inherits not only the properties and
methods of its class, but also those of other classes by way of which that
class was defined.
<P>
The major advantage of such an inheritance hierarchy is that, given a well-documented
set of existing objects, it becomes extremely easy to create new object
classes, simply by defining the new class in terms of other classes that
already exist, and simply specifying any new or different properties or
methods that apply to the new class.  This of course assumes the use of
adequate object documentation and management practices.  Without such practices,
it becomes difficult if not impossible to identify a suitable base object
from a large library of existing object classes.
<P>
However, many existing implementations of the class-based approach extend
the inheritance hierarchy to a great degree, such that almost all imaginable
object classes are defined in terms of parent object classes. While this
provides a unified approach to the problem of object definition, the significant
disadvantage of such an approach is the increased level of interdependence
between objects.  The unit of modularity becomes the complete hierarchy
rather than the individual object, since an object has no complete definition
in its own right.  The reuse of a single object therefore requires the inclusion
of its complete parent hierarchy.  Since it is typical for this parent hierarchy
to be defined dynamically using run-time definitions for parent classes
rather than defined statically at application generation, it is also possible
for changes to a parent class to cause unforeseen side-effects in the behavior
of descendant object classes.  Thus inheritance hierarchies require careful
management to ensure that such side effects do not occur and adversely affect
the integrity of applications and data.
<P>
Where the inheritance hierarchy is taken to the extent of providing system-defined
object classes, to which all application-defined object classes are linked,
the hierarchy and thus the application is dependent upon the existence of
a<I> virtual machine</I> conceptual environment, which must also be accepted
along with the hierarchy.  This in turn may result in significant penalties
in terms of application efficiency and run-time performance.
<P>
A <A HREF="622_L2_modulebased.html"><B>module-based</B></A> approach to
object-oriented programming defines each object as complete in its own right.
 Objects may still be grouped into classes for easier definition and processing,
but each class possesses its own complete set of properties and methods,
and is not dependent upon another class for a part of this definition.  The
primary advantage of the module-based approach is the increased level of
independence between objects, with a finer degree of granularity in the
application allowing object reuse with a lower level of overhead.  The main
disadvantage of this approach is that each object class must be completely
defined,<!-- entering slot 201 --> requiring more work on the part of the
application developer at the time the object is created.
<P>
The concept of inheritance, while providing great potential for productivity
enhancement during the application development process, must be carefully
managed in order to avoid additional complications in application management
and maintenance due to object interdependencies.  Side effects arising from
modification to parent object classes may adversely affect the integrity
of an application.  The alternative course of action, that of prohibiting
the modification of existing objects in favor of creating new objects that
inherit only the unmodified properties of the existing object, is often
not viable due to the increased application overhead and managerial effort
required to maintain and control an ever-expanding inheritance hierarchy.
Reliance on the behavior of existing objects must therefore be viewed with
extreme caution in the absence of effective management controls over object
modification.
<P>
The increase in development productivity provided by the use of inheritance
may often be offset by the increased time and effort spent in regression
testing of existing applications in order to determine any effects on these
applications caused by the modification of existing object classes.  Tight
managerial controls over development must therefore be maintained in order
to identify and isolate those existing object classes that are modified
and which are likely to affect existing applications.
<P>
One technique that can be used to minimize the impact on existing applications
is for the development organization to adopt a standard whereby, once an
application object is deployed in a production environment, new applications
that use the object may<I> only</I> modify its behavior through the use
of subclassing (see <A HREF="191_L3_Subclassing.html">Subclassing</A>).
 This means that the object itself is not modified, and other applications
that use the object are not affected.
