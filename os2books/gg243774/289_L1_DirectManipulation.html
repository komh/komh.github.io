<H1>Direct Manipulation</H1><!-- entering slot 318 -->
<P>
Direct manipulation of icons on the Presentation Manager desktop in order
to carry out processing tasks has been possible since the first release
of Presentation Manager in OS/2 Version 1.1, but only in Version 1.3 was
a standard method introduced for implementing such function.  Previously,
each programmer needed to devise a set of protocols, and write code in every
application to handle all the mouse messages and interaction between windows
that may have been needed.
<P>
OS/2 Version 1.3 introduced some standards for coding direct manipulation
operations, in the form of new message classes (the DM_xxxx messages), and
standard protocols known as <A HREF="666_L2_renderingmechanism.html"><B>rendering
mechanisms</B></A>, which are used to communicate required information for
commonly used direct manipulation operations. This support is continued
in OS/2 V2.0, and is of increased importance since the Workplace Shell itself
makes extensive use of direct manipulation.  Applications that use direct
manipulation are therefore more likely to be written under Version 2.0,
either to interact with one another or to make use of Workplace Shell facilities
such as printer objects or the shredder.
<P>
This chapter discusses the use of direct manipulation in a program, covering
the major messages and data structures involved, and the use of the standard
rendering mechanisms.  Examples of the use of these messages and data structures
are given, along with guidance on implementing a private rendering mechanism
to meet the needs of a particular application.
