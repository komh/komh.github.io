message box
<P>
Within Presentation Manager, a specialized type of dialog box that carries
out a simple structured dialog with the user.  This dialog is limited to
the display of some textual information, and the input of a single choice
from a limited, finite set of mutually exclusive options.  A message box
is simpler to process than a dialog box, and is useful in circumstances
where the sophistication of a dialog box is unnecessary.
