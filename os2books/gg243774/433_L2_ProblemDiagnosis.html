<P>
Once the cause of the error is narrowed down to a single statement within
the source code, the problem with that statement must then be identified.
Syntactical errors can generally be ruled out as a cause of failure during
run time, since such errors are almost always identified during compilation
of the application code.  However, the items listed below are common causes
of run-time errors, and should be checked for failing program statements:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Logic:  is the sequence of operations performed during
the processing of a message in accordance with the application design?  Have
any steps been accidentally omitted?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Parameters:  are the correct variable names being
used for parameters in the program statement?  Do the parameter definitions
in the program statement directly match those given in the function declaration?
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Pointers:  do they contain valid references, and/or
have they been correctly initialized prior to the program statement?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Operating system or Presentation Manager resources:
 have they been successfully allocated prior to the program statement?  Are
resources released at the completion of processing for the event and if
not, is there a valid reason for retaining them?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Step #5: </B> Diagnose the cause of the problem by carefully checking
the program statement, and correct the error.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The following sections provide descriptions of some common application problems
against which failing programs may be checked.
