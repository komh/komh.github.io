<H1>Using Direct Manipulation</H1><!-- entering slot 328 -->
<P>
The following sections use an example to illustrate the way in which direct
manipulation can be used within a Presentation Manager application or a
Workplace Shell  object. The example consists of a<I> Customer</I> program
which reads and displays customer details.  Each customer is displayed as
an object in a container window.
<P>
The other component of the example is a<I> Telephone</I> program, which
accepts customer information from the<I> Customer</I> program via drag/drop,
and automatically dials the customer's telephone number.  The<I> Telephone
</I>program communicates with the<I> Customer</I> program using a private
rendering mechanism defined by the application.  This rendering mechanism
uses shared memory, and is identified by the name DRM_SHAREMEM.  The rendering
mechanism is explained in detail in <A HREF="305_L3_ImplementingaPrivate.html">Implementing
a Private Rendering Mechanism</A>.
<P>
The example uses Presentation Manager windows as both the source and target
for the drag/drop operation, since this enables a description of the complete
set of steps required to complete the operation.  For Workplace Shell objects,
certain steps are handled automatically by the Workplace Shell itself, and
a Workplace Shell object class is therefore not required to carry out these
steps.  Where a particular step is automated by the Workplace Shell, this
is noted in the discussion.
