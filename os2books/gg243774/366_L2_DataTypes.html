<H1>Data Types</H1><!-- entering slot 408 -->
<P>
A number of the function type declarations and data type definitions used
by Presentation Manager map into different "standard" C language type definitions
under OS/2 Version 2.0.  This is due to the differences between the 16-bit
architecture of previous versions and the 32-bit architecture of Version
2.0.
<P>
For example, the Presentation Manager data type EXPENTRY, used to declare
exportable entry points, is defined under OS/2 Version 1.3 in the following
way:
<PRE>#define EXPENTRY     pascal far
</PRE>

<P>
However, the<I> pascal</I> linkage convention is not used in the 32-bit
OS/2 Version 2.0  programming environment, since all function calls use
the standard C calling convention.  The only exception is when creating
applications that access 16-bit functions; see <A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing
16-Bit and 32-Bit Application Modules</A>.
<P>
In addition,<I> far</I> memory references are not used, since the 32-bit
flat memory model allows addressability to all locations in the process
address space.  In the 32-bit programming environment therefore, the EXPENTRY
type is defined as blanks; 32-bit applications are not required to use the
EXPENTRY keyword.
<P>
The OS/2 header file<I> os2.h</I> provided with the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit
for OS/2 2.0</I> provides transparent remapping of the Presentation Manager
type definitions to their new C language equivalents, and thus no modification
is required to existing functions and data definitions that use the Presentation
Manager types.  However, applications that have used standard C language
type definitions in place of the Presentation Manager types will require
modification.  For this reason, it is recommended that<I> all</I> Presentation
Manager applications should use the Presentation Manager function and data
type definitions.
