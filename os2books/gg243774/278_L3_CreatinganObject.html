<H1>Creating an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 303 -->
<P>
A new object class in the Workplace Shell is typically created by taking
an existing object class and subclassing it, introducing new data and methods,
and modifying existing behaviors where required.  The new object class is
then registered with the Workplace Shell, and is available from that point
on.
<P>
<B>Registration</B>
<P>
Once an object class has been defined, compiled and placed into a dynamic
link library, it must be registered with Workplace Shell before it can be
used.  This may be accomplished in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The simplest method is to place the DLL for the object
in a directory that is included in the LIBPATH statement in CONFIG.SYS.
 Once this is done, opening the the<I> Templates</I> folder on the Workplace
Shell desktop will automatically cause the DLL to be loaded and a template
for the object class to appear in the<I> Templates</I> folder.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->An object class may also be registered with the Workplace
Shell using the<B> WinRegisterObjectClass()</B> function. This function
records the name of the object class, and the name of the DLL that contains
the code to implement the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
An example of the<B> WinRegisterObjectClass()</B> function is given in <A HREF="052_L2_RegisteringaWorkplac.html">Figure
"Registering a Workplace Shell Object Class"</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="052_L2_RegisteringaWorkplac.html">Figure "Registering a Workplace
Shell Object Class"</A> provides a very simple example; a useful technique
for registering object classes is to build a simple program that reads a
set of strings from an ASCII data file and uses these strings as parameters
to the<B> WinRegisterObjectClass()</B> function.  In this way, a generic
object-registraion routine can be built and used for multiple object classes,
without the need to modify and recompile source code.
<P>
Note that once an object class has been registered with the Workplace Shell,
it is permanently available until it is explicitly deleted by deregistering
it. See <A HREF="281_L3_DeregisteringanObjec.html">Deregistering an Object
Class</A> for information on deregistering an object class.
<P>
<B>Class Data</B>
<P>
Class data is owned by the object class rather than by an instance of that
class.  It is therefore available to all instances of the class, and must
be initialized prior to instantiating any objects within the class.
<P>
For this reason, class data is initialized when the object classes are loaded
from their DLLs, either during Workplace Shell initialization or dynamically
during execution.  Class data initialization is performed by the<I> _wpclsInitData
</I>class method, which is called by the system when the class is loaded.
 If a new object class has class data that must be initialized, it should
override the<I> _wpclsInitData</I> method and perform its class-specific
processing.
<P>
An example of an overridden<I> _wpclsInitData</I> method from the password-protected
folder example is shown in <A HREF="053_L2_InitializingClassDat.html">Figure
"Initializing Class Data"</A>.
<P>
In the example shown in <A HREF="053_L2_InitializingClassDat.html">Figure
"Initializing Class Data"</A>, a global variable<I> hModule</I> is used
to contain the module handle for the DLL, which is required when loading
Presentation Manager resources such as strings, pointers or dialogs.  Since
a global variable is used rather than a class data variable, the first statement
in the overridden method, which obtains a handle to the class data, is not
required and is therefore commented out.
<P>
Any class data items obtained or initialized by an object class from within
the<I> _wpclsInitData</I> method should also be freed by the object class,
by overriding the<I> _wpclsUnInitData</I> method. This method is invoked
by the system when an object class is deregistered (see <A HREF="281_L3_DeregisteringanObjec.html">Deregistering
an Object Class</A>), or when the Workplace Shell process is terminated.
 An example of the<I> _wpclsUnInitData</I> method is shown in <A HREF="054_L2_FreeingClassDataItem.html">Figure
"Freeing Class Data Items"</A>.
<P>
The example shown in <A HREF="054_L2_FreeingClassDataItem.html">Figure "Freeing
Class Data Items"</A> assumes that the module handle for the DLL has already
been obtained and stored in the global variable<I> hModule</I>, as shown
in <A HREF="053_L2_InitializingClassDat.html">Figure "Initializing Class
Data"</A>.
<P>
<B>Instantiation</B>
<P>
Once an object class has been registered with the Workplace Shell, an instance
of that class may be created; this is normally known as<B> instantiation</B>.
 This may be done in one of two ways.  The simplest method is to open the
<I>Templates</I> folder and drag the template for the object class to the
required location.  Alternatively, an object may be created from within
an application, using the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> function, an example
of which is given in <A HREF="055_L2_CreatinganObject.html">Figure "Creating
an Object"</A>.
<P>
Note that the<I> pszParams</I> parameter shown in <A HREF="055_L2_CreatinganObject.html">Figure
"Creating an Object"</A> is used to contain a<I> setup string</I>, which
can be used to pass one or more of a number of parameters to the object
class.  In the example, it is used<!-- entering slot 304 --> only to set
the icon for the object, but may also be used to specify other parameters
for that instance of the class.  The keywords and values supported by the
<I>WPObject</I> class are documented in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation
Manager Reference</I>; other object classes may add their own keywords and
values.
<P>
The final parameter contains one or more flags which determine the behavior
of the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> call if the object being created clashes
with an object that already exists with the specified name and in the specified
location.  Valid actions are for the call to fail, to update the existing
object or to replace the existing object.  These flags are documented in
the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
The setup string is passed as a parameter to the<I> _wpSetup</I> method,
which is invoked when the object is instantiated.  This method is defined
by the<I> WPObject</I> class, and may be overridden by a new object class
in order to check for its own keywords and take appropriate setup action.

<P>
The<I> _wpSetup</I> method accepts the setup string as a parameter, and
may then parse the setup string, extract any class-specific data and perform
appropriate processing on that data.  However, since many of the keywords
that may be specified in the setup string are defined by the<I> WPObject
</I>class and are handled by the default<I> _wpSetup</I> method, the default
processing must be carried out.  In this particular case, the default processing
may be carried out before or after the class-specific processing.
<P>
An example of an overridden<I> _wpSetup</I> method is shown in <A HREF="056_L2_ObjectSetup.html">Figure
"Object Setup"</A>; this example shows the use of an additional parameter
in the setup string (PASSWORD=) to set an initial password for a password-protected
folder upon folder creation.
<P>
The setup string is parsed from within the object by calling the<I> _wpScanSetupString
</I>method. Both of these methods, along with the keywords supported by
the<I> WPObject</I> class, are described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0
Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
After performing the class-specific processing in the<I> _wpSetup</I> method,
an object class should invoke its parent class's<I> _wpSetup</I> method
to perform the default processing for any other keywords in the setup string
that are defined by the parent class.
<P>
Before the<I> _wpSetup</I> method is invoked, the system invokes the object's
<I>_wpInitData</I> method, which allows an object to allocate resources
and initialize its instance data.  See Instance Data below for further details.

<P>
Note that unlike a Presentation Manager window, which exists only for the
duration of an application's execution, an object remains in existence permanently
unless explicitly deleted from the system.
<P>
<B>Instance Data</B>
<P>
When an object is created or awakened from a dormant state, the<I> _wpInitData
</I>method is invoked by the system.  This method allows an object to initialize
its instance data to a known state.  Operating system resources should be
allocated at this stage, but Presentation Manager resources should not,
since a view of the object is not yet being opened.  The allocation of Presentation
Manager resources is typically done during processing of the<I> _wpOpen
</I>method (see <A HREF="279_L3_UsinganObject.html">Using an Object (Opening
an Object)</A>).
<P>
If an object has its own instance data, which must be initialized to a known
state before processing may be carried out, the object should override the
<I>_wpInitData</I> method in its class definition file, and include the
initialization code.  However, for any object class other than a base storage
class, the default initialization processing must be carried out in addition
to the class-specific processing.  This allows the correct initialization
of any instance data items defined by the parent class, and ensures that
the new object class behaves in a manner consistent with its ancestors.

<P>
<A HREF="057_L2_InitializingInstance.html">Figure "Initializing Instance
Data"</A> shows an overridden<I> _wpInitData</I> method, which initializes
the password information for a password-protected folder.
<P>
Note that during processing of the<I> _wpInitData</I> method, the instance
data of the object is not necessarily in a known state.  The programmer
must therefore take great care when carrying out any processing during the
execution of this method, in order to avoid using data that may not yet
have been initialized correctly.  Failure to follow this guideline may cause
unpredictable<!-- entering slot 305 --> results for the object.
