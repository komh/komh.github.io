<H1>Committing Shared Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
Like private memory objects, shared memory objects have a distinction between
allocating and committing storage.  Shared memory objects may be committed
upon allocation, or subsequently using exception handlers and the<B> DosSetMem()
</B>function.  The guard page technique may be used with shared memory objects
as well as private memory objects.
<P>
One distinction between shared memory objects and private memory objects
is that private memory objects may be "de-committed" if the required amount
of memory reduces during execution; that is, physical storage is released
without releasing the corresponding address ranges in the process address
space.  Shared memory objects may not be de-committed, to avoid the situation
where one process may de-commit a page that is being accessed by another
process.
