<H1>Using a DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 435 -->
<P>
When an application is to use functions contained in a DLL, these functions
must first be declared at compilation time.  This is typically achieved
by the use of an include file containing function prototypes for all exportable
entry points within the DLL; such an include file is normally created along
with the DLL and supplied to all application developers who will use the
DLL.
<P>
Once the functions are declared within the application's source code, the
external references must be resolved at the time the program is link edited.
 This may be performed in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The functions may be identified in the application's
module definition file using an <A HREF="592_L2_importlibrary.html"><B>IMPORTS
</B></A>statement, as described in <A HREF="387_L3_ModuleDefinitionFile.html">Module
Definition File</A>.  For example, the statement:
<PRE>IMPORTS MYPROG.func1
</PRE>

<P>
defines the function<I> func1</I>, which will be imported from a DLL named
MYPROG.DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The functions may be included in an <A HREF="593_L2_IMPORTSstatement.html"><B>import
library</B></A>, which is a library specified at link edit time.  An import
library is created using the IMPLIB utility provided with the IBM Developer's
Toolkit for OS/2 2.0.  For example, the command:
<PRE>implib MYLIB.LIB MYLIB.DEF
</PRE>

<P>
causes IMPLIB to create an import library named MYLIB.LIB, using information
contained in a module definition file named MYLIB.DEF.  The import library
file should be placed in a directory referenced by the INCLUDE environment
variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Note that the file OS2.LIB, used when link editing OS/2 application programs,
is in fact an import library containing definitions for OS/2 system functions
that are themselves implemented using DLLs.
