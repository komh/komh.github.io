<P>
As already mentioned in <A HREF="465_L2_Modularization.html">Modularization</A>,
application code should be separated into distinct source modules.  These
source modules are then compiled to produce individual object modules, which
in turn are link-edited to produce executable code. However, the executable
application code may itself consist of more than one executable module,
by virtue of the dynamic linking capabilities of the OS/2 operating system.
