inheritance
<P>
Concept whereby an application object takes on the properties of the object
class to which it belongs;  such properties may include the definition of
instance variables and data objects.  Object classes may also be defined
in terms of other, previously defined object classes; the new object class
then takes on the properties and methods of its parent class or classes
(which themselves may be defined in terms of other classes).
