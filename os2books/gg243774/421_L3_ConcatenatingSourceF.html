<H1>Concatenating Source Files</H1><!-- entering slot 463 -->
<P>
Multiple document files may be concatenated to produce a single online document.
 Concatenation is achieved by creating an OS/2 environment variable that
contains the names of the concatenated files.  For example:
<PRE>SET BIGDOC=DOC1.INF+DOC2.INF+DOC3.INF+DOC4.INF
</PRE>

<P>
This environment variable is typically set from within a batch file, which
also contains the command VIEW BIGDOC to view the resulting concatenated
document.
<P>
Hypertext links are permitted between panels in different files, but a panel
must use the<I> res=</I> attribute in the heading tag to identify itself,
rather than the<I> name=</I> or<I> id=</I> attributes.  The<I> global</I> attribute
must also be specified in the panel heading.
