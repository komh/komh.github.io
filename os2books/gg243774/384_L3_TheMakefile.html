<H1>The Makefile</H1><!-- entering slot 426 -->
<P>
The instructions to be used are placed into a<I> makefile</I>.  The new
make facility<I> NMAKE</I>, provided with the IBM Developer's Toolkit for
OS/2 2.0 is extremely flexible and rich in function.  It is recommended
that programmers read the NMAKE section of the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Programming
Tools Reference</I> if unfamiliar with makefiles.
<P>
The SOM Precompiler environment variables are set as follows:
<PRE>!if [set SMINCLUDE=.;$(SCPATH);] || \
    [set SMTMP=$(SOMTEMP)] || \
    [set SMEMIT=ih;h;ph;psc;sc;c;def]
!endif
</PRE>

<P>
The use of the<I> !if</I> directive is somewhat confusing, as the statement
has nothing to do with a conditional command.  In fact, the OS/2 SET command
is being executed to initialize the environment variables.  The NMAKE utility
executes any OS/2 command placed within square brackets in a<I> !if</I> directive.

<P>
The SMEMIT environment variable tells the SOM Precompiler  which C source
files are to be generated; the suffixes correspond to the file types described
earlier in this chapter.
<P>
The SMINCLUDE and SMTMP environment variables are set from two NMAKE macros,
which are defined at the top of the makefile:
<PRE>   SCPATH  = D:\toolkt20\sc
   SOMTEMP = .\somtemp
</PRE>

<P>
The SMINCLUDE variable tells the SOM Precompiler where to find the class
definition (.SC) include files.
<P>
The SMTMP variable locates the SOM Precompiler temporary workspace directory.

<P>
This brings us to the next part of the makefile that is responsible for
ensuring the existence of the temporary directory.
<PRE>!if [cd $(SOMTEMP)]
!  if [md $(SOMTEMP)]
!    error Error creating $(SOMTEMP) directory
!  endif
!else
!  if [cd ..]
!    error Error could not cd .. from $(SOMTEMP) directory
!  endif
!endif
</PRE>

<P>
This code checks for the existence of the directory and if it cannot be
found, attempts to create it.
