<H1>Standard Rendering Mechanisms</H1><!-- entering slot 335 -->
<P>
The following sections describe the use of two of the standard rendering
mechanisms, DRM_PRINT and DRM_OS2FILE.  These mechanisms can be used by
Presentation Manager applications to interact with other applications and/or
Workplace Shell  objects.
<P>
<B>DRM_PRINT</B>
<P>
For Presentation Manager applications running on the Workplace Shell desktop
under OS/2 Version 2.0, it may be desirable to allow the user to print from
the program by dragging the relevant item, such as a customer record, onto
a Workplace Shell printer object. Since all Workplace Shell printer objects
are written to understand the DRM_PRINT rendering mechanism, a Presentation
Manager may provide such function simply by adhering to this mechanism.

<P>
With the DRM_PRINT rendering mechanism, responsibility for actually carrying
out the printing rests within the source window.  The source window must:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Detect the fact that a drag is being initiated
by the user<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Allocate and fill the DRAGINFO and DRAGITEM structures
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Start the drag operation using the<B> DrgDrag()
</B>function<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Process the DM_PRINTOBJECT message which is returned
by the target printer object.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The first three steps are handled in exactly the same way as illustrated
in <A HREF="069_L2_DragInitiationFromaC.html">Figure "Drag Initiation From
a Container Window"</A>.  Note that a view of a Workplace Shell object need
not explicitly handle Presentation Manager messages in the window procedures
for its views.  When the user initiates a drag from within a Workplace Shell
object such as a folder or work area, the object is notified by the Workplace
Shell, which invokes the object's<I> _wpFormatDragItem</I> method.  This
method is processed in an identical manner to that shown for the window
procedure in <A HREF="069_L2_DragInitiationFromaC.html">Figure "Drag Initiation
From a Container Window"</A>.
<P>
The final step is handled by processing the DM_PRINTOBJECT message in the
source window procedure.  A simple example of such processing is shown in
<A HREF="070_L2_ReceivingaDM_PRINTOB.html">Figure "Receiving a DM_PRINTOBJECT
Message"</A>.
<P>
<B>DRM_DISCARD</B>
<P>
The DRM_DISCARD rendering mechanism operates in a similar fashion to the
DRM_PRINT mechanism, and is intended for use by applications which create
their own equivalent to the Workplace Shell<I> Shredder</I> object.  In
this rendering mechanism, the target passes a DM_DISCARDOBJECT message to
the source, which may either accept responsibility for the discard operation,
abort the operation, or allow the system to perform the operation.
<P>
Note that the system may only discard objects which are capable of being
rendered with the DRM_OS2FILE rendering mechanism; that is, program files
and data files.  Other objects not based upon files must be explicitly discarded
by the source.
<P>
When a Workplace Shell object is dropped on the<I> Shredder</I> object,
the Workplace Shell intercepts the DM_DISCARDOBJECT message and invokes
the source object's<I> wpDelete</I> method.
<P>
<B>DRM_OS2FILE</B>
<P>
The DRM_OS2FILE rendering mechanism is designed to support moving and copying
file objects between containers.  This rendering mechanism is described
in detail in the<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming Guide Volume II</I>, and an extensive
example is provided in the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0.  The details
of programming for the DRM_OS2FILE mechanism will therefore not be described
further in this document.
<P>
Certain fields in the DRAGITEM structure are designed specifically for this
rendering mechanism; the<I> hstrContainer</I>,<I> hstrSourceName</I> and
<I>hstrTargetName</I> fields are ideally suited to holding the source directory
name, source file name, and fully qualified target file name respectively.
 This is how these fields are used by the DRM_OS2FILE rendering mechanism.

<P>
An alternative, and even more straightforward way to<!-- entering slot 336 --> implement
this rendering mechanism, is to use the<B> DrgDragFiles()</B> function.
 This function automatically allocates and fills the required data structures
for the source window, avoiding the need for the application to perform
these functions and reducing the risk of error.
