<P>
Direct manipulation is likely to become considerably more important to application
designers than it has been in previous releases of OS/2, because of its
central role in the object-oriented user interface provided by the Workplace
Shell.  Even applications that are not implemented as Workplace Shell objects
should provide, so far as is practical, a similar style of interface. Direct
manipulation forms an essential part of such an interface.
<P>
The programming facilities for direct manipulation in OS/2 V2.0 are essentially
the same as those introduced in OS/2 Version 1.3, and consist of a set of
message classes, functions and data structures, along with defined protocols
known as rendering mechanisms, which define standard techniques for using
these facilities to pass different types of information between diverse
applications, and between user-developed applications and Workplace Shell
objects such as printers and the shredder.
<P>
User-defined rendering mechanisms may also be defined for specific purposes
that are not covered by the standard ones.  The<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming
Guide Volume II</I> gives guidance on this and on how such rendering mechanisms
should be documented.
