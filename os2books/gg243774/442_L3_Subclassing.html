<P>
When a generic application object (that is, window class) does not quite
meet the requirements of an application, a developer may choose to use the
generic object and modify its behavior, through subclassing, to meet the
specific requirements.  This may be easily achieved in conjunction with
the methods described above, since the handle of the newly created window
is either returned directly by the called routine or indirectly by the window
itself.  This handle can then be used in the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function
call.
<P>
The subject of subclassing is described in detail in <A HREF="248_L3_SubclassingaWindow.html">Subclassing
a Window</A>, along with examples of both the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function
and a subclass window procedure.
