<H1>Dragging Over a Window</H1><!-- entering slot 331 -->
<P>
While the dragitem is being dragged, Presentation Manager sends a succession
of DM_DRAGOVER messages to the Presentation Manager window under the mouse
pointer; one message is sent for every mouse movement. The DM_DRAGOVER message
informs the target window that it is being dragged over, and allows it to
access sufficient information to allow the window to decide whether it is
able to accept a drop operation.  The window procedure indicates this to
Presentation Manager by the value that it returns in response to the DM_DRAGOVER
message.
<P>
The information required by the window is contained in two data structures;
the DRAGINFO structure, which is referenced by one of the parameters in
the DM_DRAGOVER message, and the DRAGITEM structure, which can be accessed
from the DRAGINFO structure.  Since multiple items may be dragged at the
same time, the DRAGINFO structure contains an array of pointers to DRAGITEM
structures, one for each dragitem.  The DRAGINFO structure maintains a count
of the number of dragitems.
<P>
When a potential target is a Workplace Shell object, the Workplace Shell
notifies the object that a dragitem is being dragged over it, by invoking
the object's<I> _wpDragOver</I> method. The DRAGINFO structure is passed
to the object as a parameter to this method.  Processing of the<I> _wpDragOver
</I>method is very similar to that described below for Presentation Manager
window procedures.  In normal circumstances, however, the<I> _wpDragOver
</I>method is not overridden by an object class; the default processing
supplied by the parent class is allowed to occur unless the object class
supports private rendering mechanisms that must be explicitly checked against
those supported by the dragitem.
<P>
An example of the way in which a window procedure may process the DM_DRAGOVER
message is shown in <A HREF="071_L2_HandlingtheDM_DRAGOV.html">Figure "Handling
the DM_DRAGOVER Message"</A>.
<P>
The code shown in <A HREF="071_L2_HandlingtheDM_DRAGOV.html">Figure "Handling
the DM_DRAGOVER Message"</A> is quite simple; the processing of the DM_DRAGOVER
message is intended only to determine whether a drop operation is valid
for the specified dragitem and the target window.  First, access is gained
to the DRAGINFO structure, which is referenced by the first parameter to
the DM_DRGOVER message.  The DRAGINFO structure is then used to access the
DRAGITEM structure, by means of the<B> DrgQueryDragitemPtr()</B> function.
The window procedure then has access to all the information needed to determine
the validity of a drop operation.
<P>
In this particular case, the only type of dragitem that is acceptable to
the target window is one that represents a customer object, using the specially
defined DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism.  The window procedure therefore
uses the<B> DrgVerifyRMF()</B> function to check whether the dragitem supports
this rendering mechanism and the data type required by it.
<P>
According to the result returned by the<B> DrgVerifyRMF()</B> function,
the window procedure returns either DOR_DROP, indicating that a drop is
acceptable, or DOR_NEVERDROP, indicating that a drop is not acceptable and
that there is no point in sending any more DM_DRAGOVER messages to this
window.  A number of other valid returns are possible for the DM_DRAGOVER
message; these are documented in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation
Manager Reference</I>.  Irrespective of the return code, the DRAGINFO structure
is released.
<P>
If a window returns any return code other than DOR_DROP to this message,
the icon seen by the user is automatically modified to show that a drop
is not allowed, thereby providing instant visual feedback.
