<P>
A desktop is typically regarded as a two-dimensional display space;  in
fact, a desktop is three-dimensional, since when windows overlap on the
desktop, one window is conceptually "on top of" the other.  This concept
of "stacking" windows applies even when windows do not actually overlay
one another on the desktop.  The order in which windows appear on the desktop
is known as the <A HREF="718_L2_zorder.html"><B>z-order</B></A>. The z-order
is known to Presentation Manager, and a number of function calls are provided
that enable an application to request window handles of specific windows
in the z-order using the<B> WinGetNextWindow()</B> function to obtain the
handle of the next window in the z-order, or the<B> WinQueryWindow()</B> function
to obtain the handle of a window at a specified position in the z-order.

<P>
Since the z-order changes dynamically as different applications create and
destroy windows, Presentation Manager takes a "snapshot" of the desktop
state when the application issues a<B> WinBeginEnumWindows()</B> call.  This
function accepts a window handle as a parameter, and the z-order of all
immediate children of that window is recorded by Presentation Manager.  A
call to this function should be issued before any<B> WinGetNextWindow()
</B>call is issued, or before any<B> WinQueryWindow()</B> call is issued
that specifies a position in the z-order.  When the application no longer
wishes to interrogate the recorded window hierarchy, a<B> WinEndEnumWindows()
</B>call should be made.
<P>
The concepts of z-order and window enumeration are useful in circumstances
where an operation or sequence of operations must be performed on a number
of windows in order.  Windows with the same parent always appear contiguously
in the z-order, and thus may be easily processed in succession.
