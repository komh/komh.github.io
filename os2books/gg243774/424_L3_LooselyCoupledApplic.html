<P>
Where the steps in a business process are independent of one another and
do not require any great coordination between supporting application functions,
separate programs may be used to carry out each step.  In this case, the
procedure manual is created as an online document with links for each step.
 Each link is specified with<I> reftype=launch</I>.
