<H1>Committing Storage at Allocation</H1><!-- entering slot 246 -->
<P>
For memory objects that have a fixed size, such as internal application
storage, control blocks and most instance data, memory objects should be
committed immediately upon allocation, allowing the application to access
the memory object without the inconvenience and additional overhead of explicitly
committing the storage at a later time.
<P>
Storage for a memory object may be committed using the PAG_COMMIT flag in
the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call used to allocate the memory object,
as shown in <A HREF="018_L2_CommittingStorageDur.html">Figure "Committing
Storage During Allocation"</A>. The above example creates a 72KB memory
object in a similar manner to that shown in <A HREF="017_L2_AllocatingMemoryinOS.html">Figure
"Allocating Memory in OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>, but commits the storage during
allocation, so that is immediately available for use by the application.
