<H1>Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 376 -->
<P>
While a queue may only be read by its owner, a pipe may be used for either
read access, write access or both.  Pipes  function in a similar way to
files, and once created, are accessed  using the OS/2 file system programming
functions such as the <B> DosRead()</B> and<B> DosWrite()</B> functions.
This means that pipes can be accessed by other applications in the  system
that support file system operations, including applications  executing in
virtual DOS machines.  In this way, interprocess communication can be  supported
between an OS/2 application and a DOS or Windows application.
<P>
Pipes may be either named or anonymous.  Communication via an  anonymous
pipe requires that the read and write handles for the pipe  are known to
both processes involved in the communication.  Since these  handles are
not shared by default, another means of passing the  handles, such as Presentation
Manager messages or shared memory, must be used.  For  this reason, anonymous
pipes are typically less useful than named pipes  for interprocess communication,
and are therefore used mainly for  "streaming" communication between threads
in the same process.
<P>
Named pipes are even more similar to files than anonymous pipes,  since
they are initially accessed using predefined names rather than  requiring
handles.  Hence a process may easily obtain access to a named  pipe, provided
it knows the name of the pipe.  Once the pipe has been  created or opened,
the process uses a pipe handle, which is similar to  a file handle, to access
the pipe via<B> DosRead()</B> and<B> DosWrite()</B> function calls.
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 introduces a number of new functions for accessing named  pipes,
which simplify programming in the client-server environment.  These are
the<B> DosCallNPipe()</B> function and the<B> DosTransactNPipe()</B> function,
both of which are explained in the following text.
<P>
Note that while queues allow many processes to access and write to  the
queue, a named pipe is typically a one-to-one connection; the  creator of
the pipe may interact with only one other process at a time,  and that process
must relinquish access to the pipe before another  process may gain access.
 For this reason, pipes have some limitations  when used in a client-server
environment with many requesters being  serviced by a single server, as
will become evident from the following  examples.
<P>
A named pipe is normally created by the server process, using the<B> DosCreateNPipe()
</B>function. During creation of the pipe, the server specifies the type
of access  that is allowed for the pipe.  The following types of access
are valid:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Inbound access (client to server)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Outbound access (server to client)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Duplex (both).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Since only one client process may have access to a named pipe at any  given
time, the requester must wait for the named pipe to become  available, using
the<B> DosWaitNPipe()</B> function.
<P>
<A HREF="097_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure "Interprocess Communication
Using Named Pipes (Part 1)"</A> shows a secondary thread routine in a requester
 process, which is dispatched to make a request to a server process.
<P>
In the example shown in <A HREF="097_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Named Pipes (Part 1)"</A>, the requester
dispatches  a secondary thread that waits synchronously for the named pipe
to  become available.  This thread accepts a pointer to a data structure
 that contains the request and reply buffers along with the window handle
of the window that initiated the thread. This window handle is included
so that a notification message can be posted to the window when the request
is complete.  Since a separate thread is dispatched for each request, the
thread terminates when the reply is returned by the server.  Hence no object
window is necessary.
<P>
When the pipe becomes available, the requester opens the pipe, writes the
request, reads the reply and then<!-- entering slot 377 --> closes the pipe.
 These functions are all performed by a single call to the <B> DosCallNPipe()
</B>function. This function actually opens the pipe using a<B> DosOpen()
</B>function call, and writes the request to the pipe using the<B> DosWrite()
</B>function. The reply is read using the<B> DosRead()</B> function and
the pipe is closed using the<B> DosClose()</B> function. Use of the<B> DosCallNPipe()
</B>function simplifies the  application code by allowing the programmer
to combine these operations into a single function call.
<P>
Once the reply is received from the server and the <B> DosCallNPipe()</B> function
returns, the requester thread notifies the window from which the request
was made, by posting a Presentation Manager message to it.  The pointer
to the transaction data structure initially passed to the thread is returned
with the message, enabling the window procedure to easily differentiate
this request from any others that may currently be active.
<P>
The server process creates the named pipe, as shown in <A HREF="098_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Named Pipes (Part 2)"</A>, using the<B> DosCreateNPipe()
</B>function.
<P>
Once the pipe is created, the server process makes the pipe available  to
a requester process by issuing a<B> DosConnectNPipe()</B> function call.
 This enables any requester processes currently waiting for the pipe to
contend for ownership.  The requester that claims ownership returns from
its<B> DosWaitNPipe()</B> call, while other requesters continue to wait.

<P>
The server then uses the<B> DosRead()</B> function to retrieve a request
from the pipe.  Since blocking mode is selected in the<B> DosCreateNPipe()
</B>call by specifying the NP_WAIT flag, the<B> DosRead()</B> call does
not return until a request becomes available.
<P>
Once the read operation completes, the server process services the  request
and writes the returned data back to the pipe using the <B> DosWrite()</B> function.
 It then informs the requester that the  request has completed, using a
Presentation Manager message, and obtaining the window  handle of the requester
from the<I> Request</I> structure.
<P>
Note that the server process cannot make the pipe available to other requesters
by issuing a<B> DosDisconnectNPipe()</B> call, until the current requester
has completed retrieval of the information from the pipe.  If this call
is issued before the requester retrieves  its returned data, the requester's
<B>DosRead()</B> call will  fail.  The server ensures that correct synchronization
is maintained by  passing the completion message<I> synchronously</I> using
the <B> WinSendMsg()</B> function.  For this reason, and in order to  ensure
that user responsiveness is maintained, it is recommended that  requesters
interacting with named pipes should do so from within object windows created
in secondary threads under the control of the  application's primary process.

<P>
Once the pipe is made available once more, this cycle of operations continues
for each request issued to the server.  The server process is suspended
within the<B> DosConnectNPipe()</B> call until a request is issued by a
requester process.
<P>
Note that where a one-to-one relationship exists between the server and
requester processes, the requester need not relinquish access to the named
pipe between requests.  In such situations, the named pipe would be opened
by the requester using the<B> DosOpen()</B> function directly, and accessed
using the<B> DosTransactNPipe()</B> function. This function combines the
<B>DosWrite()</B> and<B> DosRead()</B> functions.  When the secondary thread
is terminated, it can relinquish access to the pipe using the <B> DosClose()
</B>function.
