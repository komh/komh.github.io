<H1>Modeless Action Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 394 -->
<P>
A modeless action window is preferred in situations where the dialog with
the user need not be completed before other user interaction with the application
may occur.  For instance, in an application object that performs an administrative
procedure, data entry would typically be performed by the use of control
windows.  Since the control windows should remain displayed at all times,
their parent window should not be  sizable.  By definition, the parent window
is an optimized window, and  should therefore be created as a dialog box.
 However, it may not be  mandatory for the user to complete the dialog before
interacting with  other windows, and the dialog box should therefore be
modeless.
<P>
Since the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function automatically creates and executes
a modal dialog box, a modeless dialog box must be created in one of two
alternative ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Using the standard<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> function,
with the FCF_BORDER frame creation flag set.  Control windows such as entry
fields and buttons may then be created as children of the dialog box window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Using a<B> WinLoadDlg()</B> call to load the dialog
template from a resource into memory, and then using the<B> WinShowWindow()
</B>or<B> WinSetWindowPos()</B> functions to make the dialog box visible.
 The dialog template should have the FCF_BORDER attribute set.  Control
windows within the dialog box are defined in the dialog template.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The latter method is recommended for reasons of simplicity, since the dialog
box and its control windows may be defined and stored in a resource file
(see <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager Resources</A>),
making the definition of  the dialog box easier for the application developer.

<P>
The dialog box may be explicitly positioned on the screen, regardless of
the method used.  With the former method using the<B> WinCreateWindow()
</B>function, the dialog box is positioned at the time it is created.  With
the latter method, the dialog box is positioned during its processing of
the WM_INITDLG message.
<P>
The FCF_BORDER attribute results in the dialog box being displayed with
a thin blue line as the dialog border.  This is in accordance with  the
SAA CUA guidelines for modeless action windows.
<P>
Note that the two methods described above will result in different initialization
messages being received.  When created with the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> function,
the dialog box is regarded as a "normal" window, and a WM_CREATE message
is passed to it.  When created with the<B> WinLoadDlg()</B> function however,
a WM_INITDLG  message is passed instead. The application developer must
bear this in  mind when creating the dialog procedures for such dialog boxes.
