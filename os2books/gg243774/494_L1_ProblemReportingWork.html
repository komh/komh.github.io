<H1>Problem Reporting Worksheet</H1><!-- entering slot 537 -->
<P>
The following section contains a worksheet that may be used for reporting
problems encountered during application testing.  This worksheet follows
the guidelines given in <A HREF="427_L1_ProblemDetermination.html">Problem
Determination</A>, and requires the application user to complete the following
information:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The name of the application.  This is necessary in
order that developers may search for the error in the correct program.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The title of the active window when the error occurred.
 This is necessary in order to identify the window procedure in which the
problem most likely resides.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The title of the last user action prior to the error
occurring.  This is required in order to identify the Presentation Manager
message that is likely to have caused the error; it is probable that the
problem lies in the processing for this message.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Whether the action was attempted for the first time,
or whether the action had already been successfully completed one or more
times during the current execution of the application.  This indicates whether
the problem is probably a resource allocation error, or whether another
cause is more likely.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A description of the error, including an error message
if one was provided by the application, Presentation Manager or the operating
system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The name of the user who discovered the error, along
with a telephone number for future contact if any clarification is required.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The date and time at which the error occurred.  While
not necessary from a problem determination viewpoint, this information allows
a problem management coordinator to monitor the amount of time necessary
to respond to and rectify application problems, and therefore allows management
to determine the effectiveness of the testing and debugging process.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The worksheet also contains a space at the foot of the page, into which
readers may insert the name of the person responsible for coordinating problem
determination and resolution activities, and to whom completed worksheets
should be sent.  This person would then typically allocate the isolation,
diagnosis and resolution of problems to specific developers.
<P>
For a more complete description of Presentation Manager problem determination
procedures, readers should refer to <A HREF="427_L1_ProblemDetermination.html">Problem
Determination</A>.
<P>
Readers may photocopy the worksheet on the following page, insert the name
of the appropriate coordinator, and distribute the worksheet within their
organizations for problem-reporting purposes.
