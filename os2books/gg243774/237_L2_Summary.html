<P>
Dynamic memory allocation is greatly simplified under OS/2 Version 2.0,
since the application developer is no longer required to explicitly code
for the 80286 segmented memory model, with its size limitation of 64KB per
segment. Larger units of memory may be allocated and manipulated as single
units, simplifying application code and reducing development time for applications
that manipulate large data structures.
<P>
When executable modules compiled for different environments are executed
within the same process, the operating system handles interaction between
these modules through thunk layers.  The conversions made within the thunk
layers are transparent to the application modules themselves, and do not
require consideration by the application developer.  This enables executable
files, dynamic link libraries, and resources from different environments
to be mixed within the same application.
<P>
In general, application developers using OS/2 Version 2.0 are provided with
a greater level of function and, at the same time, may take advantage of
greatly simplified application development through use of the 32-bit flat
memory model, which removes much of the inherent complexity of memory manipulation
within the application.  Developers may produce applications more efficiently
under Version 2.0, and may easily migrate their applications to and from
the OS/2 Version 2.0 environment.
