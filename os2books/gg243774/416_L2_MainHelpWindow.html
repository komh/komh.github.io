<H1>Main Help Window</H1><!-- entering slot 458 -->
<P>
The<B> WinCreateHelpInstance()</B> function returns a window handle.  This
is the handle of the application's main help window.  The main help window
is created by IPF, with a standard format and with a window procedure supplied
by Presentation Manager.  Whenever a help panel is displayed, it appears
as a child window of the main help window.
<P>
The main help window has a title bar, which contains a title specified by
the application.  The application passes this title in the pszHelpWindowTitle
parameter to the<B> WinCreateHelpInstance()</B> function.
<P>
The main help window contains a menu bar with several pulldown menus allowing
the user to perform text searches, view the index, etc.  An application
developer may modify this menu bar using the resource definitions contained
in the<I> hmtailor.rc</I> file provided with IPF.  This file includes an
<I>hmtailor.h</I> file, which contains the integer constant definitions
for the menu bar and pulldown menu items.  Additional items may be defined
within the help pulldown menu, but their resource identifiers should be
between 7F00 and 7FFF to avoid conflicts with identifiers already defined.

<P>
When the menu bar of the main help window has been modified, it must be
resource-compiled in the normal way, and combined with the application's
executable file or with a DLL.  Its resource identifier must then be specified
in the<I> idActionBar</I> parameter of the<B> WinCreateHelpInstance()</B> function
call.  If additional accelerator keys have been defined, the identifier
of the accelerator table must also be defined in the<I> idAccelTable</I> parameter.

<P>
If the menu bar and accelerator table definitions have been combined with
a DLL, the module handle of this DLL must be specified in the<I> hmodAccellActionBarModule
</I>parameter.  The module handle must first be obtained using the<B> DosLoadModule()
</B>or<B> DosGetModuleHandle()</B> functions.  These functions are described
in <A HREF="319_L3_LoadingResourcesFrom.html">Loading Resources From a DLL</A>.
