<P>
Modal action windows are used to carry out a dialog with the user in order
to define or qualify the properties of a data object upon which the user
is operating or wishes to operate.  It is important to differentiate the
properties of a data object from its contents; for instance, the properties
of a text file might be its name, parent directory, archive/hidden/read-only
attributes etc, whereas its contents would be the text within the file.
 Under Presentation Manager, manipulation of an object's contents is typically
carried out in a standard window, whereas definition or alteration of attributes
is done using a dialog box.
<P>
Note that where the dialog with the user is limited to a simple decision,
a Presentation Manager message box should be used in preference to a dialog
box for the implementation of an action window, since the coding effort
and processing overhead associated with a message box is much less than
that associated with loading and processing a dialog box.  See <A HREF="362_L3_MessageBoxes.html">Message
Boxes</A> for more information  on the use of message boxes.
<P>
A modal dialog box is typically loaded and processed in a single step using
the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> call.  The modal nature of the dialog box is indicated
to the user by a double blue line as the border for the dialog box, rather
than the standard window border.  The different border indicates that the
dialog box is modal, and also indicates that it may not be sized by the
user.  This border is specified in the dialog template using the FCF_DLGBORDER
attribute.
<P>
By default, a modal dialog box is <A HREF="506_L2_applicationmodal.html"><B>application-modal</B></A>;
 that  is, the user must complete interaction with the dialog box before
any  further interaction may take place with windows in the current application.
 A dialog box may also be <A HREF="693_L2_systemmodal.html"><B>system-modal</B></A>,
in which case the user must complete interaction with the dialog box before
interacting with<I> any</I> other window in the system.  A system-modal
dialog box is created in the same way as an application-modal dialog box,
but with  the additional attribute FS_SYSMODAL specified in the dialog template.
