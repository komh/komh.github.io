<P>
The representation of a physical device as an application object may be
extended to encompass any external entity with which an application must
interact.  Suppose that an application executing in a programmable workstation
must interface with a number of server applications executing in a System/370
host, using the SRPI interface.  The host system may be regarded as a logical
entity, and a single application object created to interact with that entity.
 All communications-related and interface-specific code may then be encapsulated
within that object, and other objects within the application need not concern
themselves with the details of the SRPI communication.  A message passed
to the application object by a requesting object elsewhere in the application
will contain the name of the server application to be invoked, and the data
to be passed to the server application.  A return message from the host-interaction
object will contain the reply data from the server application.

Interaction Within Application Object"</A>

The isolation of programming interfaces and protocols specific to the communications
architecture, within the "Host" application object provides an easy means
of insulating the remainder of the application from changes to communications
network configurations or to the remote system itself.  Such changes would
only require modification to the "Host" object.
