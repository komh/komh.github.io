<P>
The use of functions and subroutines in an object-oriented application executing
in the Presentation Manager raises some issues with regard to object boundaries.
 In general, the scope of a function or subroutine should be restricted
to a single application object, and the processing performed by that subroutine
should therefore relate<I> only</I> to the data object(s) owned by that
application object.  If a subroutine invoked from one application object
will perform processing on a data object related to a different application
object, then the subroutine should be invoked by the second  application
object, by way of a message passed from the first application object.
<P>
Four general types of subroutines may exist within an object-oriented application.
 These are discussed in the following sections, and are classified according
to the nature of their inputs and outputs.
