<H1>Communication Between IPF and Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 460 -->
<P>
Information may be communicated from IPF to an application in response to
user interaction in a help window.  This information may be in the form
of application events or errors, and is communicated to the application
in the form of a message passed to the application window specified in the
<B>WinCreateHelpInstance()</B> function.  Such messages originate from the
main help window, as part of the window procedure supplied by Presentation
Manager for that window.
<P>
<B>HM_INFORM Message</B>
<P>
This message is passed to the application when the user selects a hypertext
or hypergraphic item in a help window, for which the<I> reftype=inform</I> attribute
has been specified.  The first parameter of the HM_INFORM message contains
the identifier specified by the<I> res=</I> attribute in the hypertext or
hypergraphic link definition.
<P>
An application window typically processes the HM_INFORM message by examining
the identifier in the first message parameter, and dispatching a message
of the appropriate class to itself or another application window, in order
to initiate the action requested by the HM_INFORM message.
<P>
<B>HM_ERROR</B>
<P>
This message is passed to the application when an error occurs during a
user interaction with a help window.  This message allows the application
to display its own error message in such cases, thereby providing a consistent
appearance for error messages.  The first parameter of the message indicates
the reason for the error.  These reasons are documented in the<I> IBM OS/2
Version 2.0 Information Presentation Reference</I>.
<P>
An application typically processes the HM_ERROR message by displaying an
appropriate message box and returning zero to Presentation Manager.  If
the application does not process the message, Presentation Manager takes
no action.
<P>
<B>HM_EXT_HELP_UNDEFINED</B>
<P>
This message indicates that the user selected the "Extended help" item on
the "Help" pulldown menu, and that no such help panel was defined for the
active application window.
<P>
An application may process this message in one of three ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Display a message box indicating that no help is available
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Display its own help window by explicitly creating
and displaying the window on the screen<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Pass a HM_DISPLAY_HELP message back to IPF, instructing
IPF to display a particular help panel.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If the application does not process this message, no panel is displayed
and the user's request is simply ignored.
<P>
<B>HM_SUBITEM_NOT_FOUND</B>
<P>
This message indicates that the user issued a help request on an item for
which no help panel is defined in the current help table.  The application
may process this message in one of three ways, as described in HM_EXT_HELP_UNDEFINED
above. The application should then return TRUE to Presentation Manager.

<P>
If the application does not process this message, the extended help panel
for the currently active window is displayed by IPF.
