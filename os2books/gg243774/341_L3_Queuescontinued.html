<H1>Queues (continued)</H1><!-- entering slot 375 -->
<P>
After adding the request to the server's queue, the requester is  notified
by the server when the request has been serviced.  This is  done using a
Presentation Manager message, since the requester's window handle is  passed
to the server in the second parameter to the <B> DosWriteQueue()</B> function.
 The operating system imbeds this  value as the second doubleword of a REQUESTDATA
structure which is  passed to the server by the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> function.

<P>
Once notification is received from the server process, the requester  uses
the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> function to retrieve the returned  data from its
own queue, as shown in <A HREF="096_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Queues (Part 3)"</A>.
<P>
The DCWW_WAIT flag causes the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> function to  wait until
an element is available in the queue before returning  control to the application.
 If the process merely wishes to check  whether a queue element is available,
the DCWW_NOWAIT flag may be  specified, in which case an event semaphore
must be created and its  handle passed to the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> function.
 This  semaphore is immediately set by the operating system, and is posted
 when an element is added to the queue.  If the queue is shared between
 processes (as in the examples given herein), the semaphore must be  shared,
either by creating it as a named semaphore or by setting the  DC_SEM_SHARED
flag in the<B> DosCreateEventSem()</B> call.
<P>
It will be noted that the use of queues is very similar to that of  shared
memory, except that the queue is used to pass a pointer to a  shared memory
object, rather than a Presentation Manager message.  However, queues  have
an advantage in that they may be FIFO, LIFO or priority-based,  without
the need for the application to handle the querying and sorting  of elements.
