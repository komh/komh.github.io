<H1>Object Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 290 -->
<P>
In the simplest case, an object in the Workplace Shell consists of methods
and instance data. The Workplace Shell communicates events to the object
using messages, which in turn invoke the object's methods to perform the
processing indicated by the event.  This is in accordance with the definition
of an application object given in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.  Note that since the Workplace
Shell provides a more extensive inheritance hierarchy than the base Presentation
Manager application model, the method invoked by a particular message may
belong explicitly to the object in question, or may belong to its parent
(and be inherited from that parent).
<P>
The structure of an object in the Workplace Shell is therefore very similar
to that of a window in the conventional Presentation Manager application
model; the Workplace Shell object simply takes the object-oriented concepts
to a higher degree of implementation.  The constructs implemented by Presentation
Manager under previous versions of OS/2 can, therefore, often be implemented
more elegantly with the Workplace Shell.
<P>
For the remainder of this chapter, an example will be used to explain the
structure and behavior of an object class.  The example used is that of
a specific type of Workplace Shell folder, which has a password defined
so that it can be locked to prevent access by an unauthorized user.  This
object class is implemented by subclassing the<I> WPFolder</I> class to
create a new object class named<I> PWFolder</I>, adding new methods and
overriding existing methods where appropriate.  Sample code is provided
in the text for the various methods used to add the password protection
to the folder.
