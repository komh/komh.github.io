<P>
The entity represented by an application object may be a physical device.
For example, suppose an application is required to access a particular type
of external data input device such as an MICR reader.  The definition of
the protocols and specialized access routines necessary to interact with
such a device can be encapsulated within an application object, and the
various actions performed by the device on behalf of the application (such
as getting the next MICR document) then become the methods associated with
that object.  The application thus regards the MICR reader as an object
to which it passes messages in order to perform actions; the results of
those actions are then conveyed back to the application, also by way of
messages.
