<H1>Window Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 227 -->
<P>
It has already been mentioned that each window class within an application,
whether a display window or an object window, is associated with a window
procedure, which receives all messages intended for windows within that
class.  The window procedure contains the methods used to perform actions
upon the data object to which the window pertains, and thus contains the
application logic for the manipulation of data objects.  It may thus be
said that window procedures form the "heart" of a Presentation Manager application.

<P>
Upon invocation, the window procedure determines the type of message passed
to it, and may either process the message explicitly or pass it on to a
default window procedure supplied by Presentation Manager for standard processing.
 A window procedure is essentially an extended CASE statement, as illustrated
in <A HREF="014_L2_StructureofaWindowPr.html">Figure "Structure of a Window
Procedure"</A>.  Each case within the window procedure contains a set of
application statements and/or routines necessary to perform a particular
action.  Thus in object-oriented terminology, each case is a method in its
own right.
<P>
A window procedure is declared to return the type MRESULT, which is a 32-bit
data type declaration provided by Presentation Manager, and indicates the
nature of the window procedure's return value. Note that in the above example,
the returned values differ depending upon the message class; see Returning
from a Window Procedure below for further discussion.  Note also that in
the default case shown in <A HREF="014_L2_StructureofaWindowPr.html">Figure
"Structure of a Window Procedure"</A>, the window procedure did not decide
the return value itself, but used the value returned by the Presentation
Manager-supplied default window procedure. This is an established Presentation
Manager convention.
<P>
A window procedure should always be declared with the<I> system</I> linkage
convention; this is typically achieved by declaring the function to be of
type EXPENTRY.  This type identifier is defined in the system header file
<I>OS2DEF.H</I>, and simply specifies use of the<I> system</I> linkage convention.
 Use of the<I> system</I> linkage convention is required since a window
procedure is invoked by Presentation Manager on the application's behalf,
rather than directly by the application.  Note that under previous versions
of OS/2, the EXPENTRY keyword resulted in use of the<I> pascal</I> linkage
convention, for precisely the same reason.
<P>
Subject to programming language conventions, a window procedure has the
ability to define a data object or instance data, or to establish access
to an existing data object as part of its initialization processing.  When
a window is created by Presentation Manager in response to an application's
request, Presentation Manager immediately dispatches a message of the system-defined
class WM_CREATE to that window (see <A HREF="014_L2_StructureofaWindowPr.html">Figure
"Structure of a Window Procedure"</A>).  The window procedure may process
this message in order to define instance data or establish access to data
objects.  Typically, a window procedure requests the allocation of a memory
object as a control block for its instance data.  Initial values for the
instance data are then placed in the control block, and a pointer to the
control block is stored in the window words.  A window procedure thus supports
the object-oriented concept of encapsulation, by allowing the dynamic allocation
of and establishment of access to data objects, within a single application
object.
<P>
Note that prior to allocating instance data or performing any other processing
for the WM_CREATE message, a window procedure should invoke the default
message processing provided by Presentation Manager in the<B> WinDefWindowProc()
</B>function.  This ensures that the initialization of Presentation Manager's
control data for the window is completed prior to WM_CREATE processing by
the window procedure.  This in turn ensures that the window handle, window
words, etc., will be available during the window procedure's WM_CREATE processing.

<P>
<B>Invoking a Window Procedure</B>
<P>
A window procedure is invoked by dispatching a message to a window of the
class with which the window procedure is associated.  Messages passed to
a window are typically initiated as the result of user interaction or application
events, or by Presentation Manager to indicate system events.
<P>
While window procedures may be invoked directly<!-- entering slot 228 --> using
a normal subroutine call, it is recommended that messages be used for<I> all
</I>communication between window procedures.  This conforms to standard
object-oriented practice, in that an object should be accessible only via
a message passed to it.
<P>
Messages may be used to invoke a window procedure in two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A message may be<I> sent</I> directly to the window
procedure using the<B> WinSendMsg()</B> call, in which case the window procedure
executes synchronously, and control does not return to the calling procedure
until processing is completed.  This method of invocation is similar to
a normal subroutine call, but preserves the message-driven structure of
the application.  Note that since the message is sent directly to the window
procedure and not placed on a queue, the normal serialization of message
processing is disturbed.  This may cause different results from those intended
by the user; thus<B> WinSendMsg()</B> should be used with care.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A window procedure may also be invoked by<I> posting
</I>a message to a queue associated with the window procedure, using the
<B>WinPostMsg()</B> call.  With this call the window procedure executes
asynchronously, and control returns to the calling procedure immediately
after the message is placed in the queue.  This method of invocation provides
a convenient and powerful means for serialized and yet asynchronous processing.
 It then becomes the responsibility of the application developer to ensure
synchronization between different window procedures.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Invoking a window procedure by posting a message to it via a queue has an
advantage over the use of<B> WinSendMsg()</B> or a direct subroutine call
in that, where multiple windows are passing messages to a single receiving
window, these messages are queued by Presentation Manager and dispatched
to the receiving object in the order in which they were initiated.  Provided
all sending windows obey the established conventions and post messages to
queues, this ensures the correct sequencing of message processing by the
receiving window, helps preserve the user's intention and facilitates maintaining
the integrity of data objects.
<P>
A window procedure accepts four parameters upon invocation; these correspond
to the four attributes of a message as described in <A HREF="209_L2_Messages.html">Messages
</A>and to the parameters of the<B> WinSendMsg()</B> and<B> WinPostMsg()
</B>functions, and are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The handle of the window for which the message
was intended<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A message-class identifier<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Two 32-bit message parameters.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that the behavior of a window procedure, and the result obtained from
processing by a window procedure, are dependent upon the class and contents
of the message sent to it.  Similarly, the same message class may be interpreted
in a different manner by window procedures belonging to different window
classes.  In this way, a window procedure supports the object-oriented concept
of polymorphism.
<P>
<B>Window Procedure Processing</B>
<P>
A window procedure will normally determine the message class, and take action
based upon that class and the contents of the message parameters.  Where
the action involves the manipulation of data objects and/or instance data,
the window procedure typically obtains access to the window's control block
by retrieving its pointer from the window words.  The window procedure then
has access to the data values, resource handles, etc., required to complete
the action.
<P>
Note that the example given earlier in this chapter contains explicit processing
options for only four types of messages; the application allows Presentation
Manager to handle all other types of messages, by passing the message to
the system-supplied default window procedure using the<B> WinDefWindowProc()
</B>function.  This illustrates one of the basic principles of a Presentation
Manager application; the window procedure processes<I> only</I> those messages
with which it is<!-- entering slot 229 --> explicitly concerned, and passes
<I>all</I> other messages to Presentation Manager for default processing.
 A window procedure<I> must</I> pass such messages on to Presentation Manager,
or unpredictable results may occur.
<P>
This "catchall" approach to implementation also allows the stepwise implementation
of methods during application development.  An application developer may
code a window procedure such that all command messages are, by default,
passed to a routine that displays a message informing the user that the
requested action is not yet implemented.  As the method for each action
is designed and coded, a case for that action may be added to the window
procedure.  Thus implementation of methods for an object proceeds in a stepwise
and independent fashion until all necessary methods are implemented.
<P>
As mentioned earlier in this chapter and illustrated in <A HREF="014_L2_StructureofaWindowPr.html">Figure
"Structure of a Window Procedure"</A>, a window procedure may process messages
of any type, including the WM_DESTROY message, which is posted to a window
upon termination.  A window procedure may explicitly process this message
in order to close files and terminate access to data objects in an orderly
manner, thus preserving the integrity of those data objects.  This ability
allows the window procedure to further support the principle of encapsulation.

<P>
<B>Returning from a Window Procedure</B>
<P>
By convention, a window procedure typically returns a Boolean value (type
MRESULT) to its caller, to indicate the result of message processing for
that message.  The value returned is significant, since Presentation Manager
takes action depending upon that value.  The defined return values for each
system-defined message class, along with the default processing provided
by Presentation Manager for each class, are given in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version
2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.  Naturally, the return values for
user-defined message classes are defined by the application developer.
<P>
If the window procedure has been invoked synchronously using<B> WinSendMsg()</B>,
the result is returned by Presentation Manager to the calling window procedure,
which may interrogate and act upon it.  If the window procedure has been
invoked asynchronously using the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> function, the result
is returned to Presentation Manager<I> only</I>.  Presentation Manager then
uses this result to determine whether any post-processing should be carried
out for the message.  Note that while the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> function call
also provides a Boolean return code to the caller, this code only indicates
whether the message was successfully posted to the queue, and<I> not</I> the
successful processing of the message by the target window procedure.
