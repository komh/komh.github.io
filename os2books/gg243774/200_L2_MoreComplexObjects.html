<H1>More Complex Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 211 -->
<P>
For relatively simple applications where a data object is retrieved, manipulated
and saved again, the foregoing definition of an application object will
suffice.  However, the situation often arises when an application must perform
some processing that is rather more complicated. Either the application
must interface with another system or external device or a certain work
task must be performed in a particular sequence of operations that is critical
to the correct completion of the task.  The incorporation of such requirements
into the object-oriented paradigm requires an expansion of the application
object concept.
<P>
The key to successful expansion of the object-oriented paradigm lies in
the definition of a data object. Whereas a data object was previously defined
as a manifestation of a logical<I> data</I> entity, the definition will
now be expanded to include any other type of logical entity or source of
information, such as an external system or a procedures manual.
