<H1>Technological Risk</H1><!-- entering slot 493 -->
<P>
Technological risks may take a wide variety of forms, and vary from simple
risks to highly complex instances involving the interrelationship of many
divergent technologies.  Some relatively simple examples of technological
risk are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Use of a new prototyping tool<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Use of a programming language other than that which
is normally used by the particular development organization<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Use of a new programming interface<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Incorporation of new analysis techniques for the gathering
of requirements.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The element of risk in the incorporation of new technologies arises from
the simple fact that they are new, and likely to be unfamiliar to the majority
of development personnel.  A period of learning will be necessary, and the
probable length of this period must be assessed in the light of required
development schedules.  Technological risk is always greater where new techniques
and procedures must be evolved in order to support and exercise the new
technologies, since elements of managerial risk are then involved.  Simple
technological tools are relatively easy to learn and use, but techniques
for their effective employment are often learned over a longer period.
<P>
The decision as to whether to utilize new technologies in a development
project must be based upon the question of whether the development organization
possesses the requisite skills to effectively exercise the new technologies,
or can acquire such skills within the timeframe of the development project,
without adversely affecting the schedule and budget of the project.  If
the first question can be answered in the positive, there is no risk involved;
if not, then it is the second question that constitutes the element of risk.

<P>
Technological risk may be mitigated by ensuring that development personnel
possess the necessary skills to effectively utilize the new technologies,
through the provision of relevant education.  The potential benefit to be
gained from the use of these technologies must be identified and quantified,
in terms of enhanced application functionality, reduced development time
and cost, etc.  This benefit must be weighed against the time and cost involved
in training personnel to a sufficient skill level in order to effectively
mitigate the risk, and against the schedule and budget imposed upon the
development organization.
<P>
Technological risk may also be mitigated by minimizing the managerial risk
involved in the use of new technologies.  If established managerial techniques
can be adapted and applied to the implementation of new technologies, the
use of these mechanisms may provide a greater degree of control over the
development process, and help to control and reduce the associated technological
risk.  Thus it can be seen that technological and managerial risk are closely
related and complimentary to one another.
