<H1>Accessing Presentation Manager Resources From a Workplace Shell Object</H1><!-- entering slot 311 -->
<P>
A Workplace Shell object may access and make use of Presentation Manager
resources such as icons, bitmaps, strings and dialogs. These resources may
reside in the same DLL as the object's code, or in another DLL.  However,
since the resources must reside in a DLL, the code that loads the resources
must use the<B> DosLoadModule</B> or<B> DosGetModuleHandle()</B> functions
to obtain module handles, as described in <A HREF="319_L3_LoadingResourcesFrom.html">Loading
Resources From a DLL</A>.  This is typically done by obtaining the module
handles as part of the<I> _wpclsInitData</I> method, and storing them either
in global variables or in class data until needed.
