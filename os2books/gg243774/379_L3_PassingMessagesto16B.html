<H1>Passing Messages to 16-Bit Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 421 -->
<P>
Passing data between 16-bit and 32-bit window procedures via message parameters
also requires consideration of the internal representations of the data
types passed within the parameter.  For system-defined message classes,
this is handled automatically by OS/2 Version 2.0, but for application-defined
message classes the conversion between addressing schemes must be handled
by the application, since the operating system has no way of determining
the intended contents of each parameter.
<P>
Simple "value" parameters (such as integers, characters, etc.) may be passed
without the need for translation.  It is recommended that message parameters
be constructed using the standard Presentation Manager macros described
in <A HREF="255_L3_CreatingMessageParam.html">Creating Message Parameters</A>.

<P>
When a pointer or handle is passed in a message parameter to a 16-bit window
procedure, the pointer or handle must be translated to the 16:16 addressing
scheme by the application.  Since the 16-bit module is unlikely to have
been written with code to achieve this conversion, it is the responsibility
of the 32-bit module.
<P>
Conversion may be achieved using the<I> _Seg16</I> keyword to explicitly
define a 16:16 pointer or handle, which is then placed in a message parameter
using the MPFROMP macro.  This is illustrated in <A HREF="115_L2_Passinga1616Pointera.html">Figure
"Passing a 16:16 Pointer as a Message Parameter"</A>.
<P>
The resulting message parameter may then be passed to a window in a 16-bit
module using the normal<B> WinPostMsg()</B> or<B> WinSendMsg()</B> functions,
using a 16:16 window handle obtained in the manner shown in <A HREF="114_L2_Creatinga16bitWindow.html">Figure
"Creating a 16-bit Window From Within a 32-bit Module"</A>.  Note that the
data structure referenced by the pointer may not be greater than 64 KB in
size, and must not cross a segment boundary.  This is ensured in <A HREF="115_L2_Passinga1616Pointera.html">Figure
"Passing a 16:16 Pointer as a Message Parameter"</A> by using the <A HREF="728_L2_#pragmaseg16.html"><B><I>#pragma
seg16</B></I></A> directive, since a structure defined using this pragma
will automatically be aligned on a segment boundary by the C Set/2 compiler.

<P>
Note also that defining a structure with the<I> #pragma seg16</I> directive
does not implicitly qualify pointers within the structure with the<I> _Seg16
</I>keyword.  Such pointers must be explicitly qualified, as shown in <A HREF="114_L2_Creatinga16bitWindow.html">Figure
"Creating a 16-bit Window From Within a 32-bit Module"</A>.  Further information
on the<I> #pragma seg16</I> directive can be found in the<I> IBM C Set/2
User's Guide</I>.
<P>
A 0:32 pointer may also be converted to a 16:16 pointer using the<B> DosFlattoSel()
</B>function provided by OS/2 Version 2.0.  This function provides the correct
remapping of pointer formats from the 32-bit flat memory model to the 16-bit
segmented memory model.
