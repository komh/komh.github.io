<P>
Accelerator keys are single keys or key sequences that are used to represent
a particular command (typically a pulldown menu item) within an application,
and provide a fast path for the entry of that command.  Accelerators are
defined for an individual window and are active whenever that window is
active.  According to Systems Application Architecture CUA conventions,
accelerator keys should be indicated to the user by placing the accelerator
key sequence alongside the command in the pulldown menu.  Accelerator keys
are defined in the resource script file using the ACCELTABLE keyword, as
shown in <A HREF="077_L2_AcceleratorTableReso.html">Figure "Accelerator
Table Resource Definition"</A>.
<P>
The symbolic name following the ACCELTABLE statement identifies the accelerator
resource, and is passed as a parameter to the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> or
<B>WinCreateStdWindow()</B> functions when the FCF_ACCELTABLE style attribute
is specified for the frame window.
<P>
In the above example, the F3 key is defined as a virtual key that when pressed
will generate a WM_COMMAND message with the value MI_EXIT.  This is equivalent
to the user having selected the "Exit" option from the menu bar. The Shift+F5
key sequence is also defined as a virtual key that will generate a WM_COMMAND
message with the value MI_TILE.  Note that the shifted state of the key
is indicated by use of the SHIFT option.  The Ctrl+D key sequence has also
been defined to generate a WM_COMMAND message with the value MI_DELETE.
 The Ctrl state of the key is indicated by the use of the CONTROL option
(in a similar manner to the SHIFT option on the previous line).  The various
options for defining accelerator keys are documented in the<I> IBM OS/2
Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
As already mentioned, an accelerator table is associated with a particular
window by specifying the resource identifier as a parameter to the<B> WinCreateWindow()
</B>or<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> functions.  In addition, the<B> WinLoadAccelTable()
</B>function may be used to dynamically load an accelerator table into memory.
The<B> WinLoadAccelTable()</B> function returns the handle of the accelerator
table in memory, which may then be passed as a parameter to the<B> WinSetAccelTable()
</B>function to activate the accelerator table for a particular queue or
window.
