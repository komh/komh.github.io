<P>
While the same techniques of management are valid in both host and workstation
environments, the distributed nature of the workstation environment presents
difficulties for the centralized control and administration of development
resources.  This section provides some suggestions as to the ways in which
a local area network (LAN) may be used to provide centralized control and
administration to a workstation-based application development environment.

<P>
In the case of C language applications developed for the Presentation Manager
environment, development resources include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Application source modules.  An application source
module is defined to comprise not only the source code itself, but also
the local and external interface include files that accompany the source
code (see <A HREF="464_L1_ApplicationProgramCo.html">Application Program
Construction</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Existing code libraries; these may need to be modified
or additional routines generated in order to meet the requirements of the
application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Presentation Manager resources such as icons, fonts,
bitmaps and dialog definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Test data sets or databases.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Compilers, link-editors, run-time libraries and other
development tools;  in an evolving development environment, it is crucial
to ensure that all development personnel use the same version and modification
level of compiler and linkage editor software, and that programming language
runtime libraries are consistent in their version.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

These resources must be created, tested and placed in locations from which
they may be accessed easily and concurrently by a number of application
developers, while at the same time maintaining adequate control over their
access and particularly over any modifications made to individual modules.

<P>
A LAN provides a useful means of enabling access by multiple developers
to a common repository of application resources.  The ways in which a LAN
may be used to address the configuration management issues arising from
the PWS development environment are described in the following sections.
