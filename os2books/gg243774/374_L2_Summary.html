<P>
Existing 16-bit applications written for OS/2 Version 1.3 may execute under
OS/2 Version 2.0 without modification.  However, significant enhancements
to performance and functionality are possible by taking advantage of additional
features provided by the 32-bit OS/2 Version 2.0 environment.  In order
to take full advantage of the 32-bit environment, applications must be modified
to use the new features.
<P>
In addition, a number of changes have been made in the 32-bit programming
environment to provide improved consistency and ease of use, simplifying
the task of learning the operating system interfaces and reducing the amount
of coding required by application developers.  The incorporation of these
changes into applications will also require source code modification.
<P>
It is not necessary for applications to migrate<I> all</I> their modules
and resources to the 32-bit environment, since OS/2 Version 2.0 allows mixing
of 16-bit and 32-bit code and resources within the same application.  However,
32-bit modules that make calls to 16-bit modules or resources must be aware
of the differences in addressing schemes between the the 16-bit and 32-bit
environments.
