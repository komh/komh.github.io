<P>
In order to enable the implementation of large-scale applications in the
programmable workstation environment, with multiple application developers
participating in design, coding and testing, it is important not only to
have an appropriate technological and architectural base for development,
but also to provide appropriate and effective management of and control
over the development process and development resources.  Established techniques
exist in the host-based application development environment for addressing
such issues, but historically, the considerations of large-scale management
and control have been overlooked in the workstation environment due to the
relatively minor nature of workstation-based development projects in the
past.
<P>
Two areas worthy of note in the workstation-based development environment
are the management of developmental risk, and the management and control
of development resources that are used and created during the application
development process.  This chapter will briefly describe these issues and
offer some suggestions as to how they may be effectively resolved.  Much
of the discussion in this chapter will deal with Presentation Manager applications
written using the C programming language, but the techniques described may
be adapted to suit other environments and programming languages.
