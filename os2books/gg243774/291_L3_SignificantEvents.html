<H1>Significant Events</H1><!-- entering slot 320 -->
<P>
There are a number of significant events that occur during a direct manipulation
operation, and which must be communicated to the source and/or target of
the operation.  These are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Initiation of the drag operation, which must be communicated
to the source so that it can initialize data structures with information
relating to the dragitem.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Dragging the object over a potential target, which
must be communicated to the target so that the target can determine whether
a drop operation is valid.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Dropping the object over a target, which must be communicated
to the target so that it may decide the form in which it wishes the dragitem
data to be passed, and allocate any necessary resources to receive the data.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Transferring the information between the source and
the target to complete the overall direct manipulation sequence.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Presentation Manager carries out much of the required notification of drag/drop
events using messages, which are passed to the source or target windows
as necessary during the drag/drop operation.  The required messages are
described in the<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming Guide Volume II</I> and their use
is discussed in <A HREF="298_L2_UsingDirectManipulat.html">Using Direct
Manipulation</A>.
<P>
In certain cases, the behavior of a Workplace Shell object participating
in a direct manipulation operation varies somewhat from that of a Presentation
Manager window.  This is due to the fact that the Workplace Shell implements
much of the required message handling itself, and directly invokes the appropriate
methods in the object.  Where the behavior of a Workplace Shell object differs
from that of a Presentation Manager window, this is noted in the text.
