<H1>Partitioning the Application</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->
<P>
With the dynamic linking capabilities of OS/2, it is possible to partition
an application into a number of executable modules.  A single base program
may be augmented by one or more dynamic link libraries.  Such an approach
has a number of advantages:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Application code that is only executed in exceptional
circumstances, such as little-used functions, exception and error-handling
routines etc, is not loaded unless it is required.  This may significantly
reduce the load time and memory requirements of the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Common functions may be shared between applications,
since dynamic link libraries are re-entrant and a single memory-resident
copy of the library code may be used by all applications.  This can further
reduce the memory requirements of an application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Functions placed in dynamic link libraries are isolated
from the main application, and may be modified without the need to re-link
the application.  This facilitates application maintenance and update, since
only the new version of the DLL need be distributed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Applications written for the Workplace Shell should be partitioned in this
manner.  Since the shell displays all objects on the desktop at system initialization,
all applications must potentially be loaded at this time.  This can dramatically
increase the time required for system initialization, along with the overall
memory requirements of the system.
<P>
These requirements may be significantly reduced by having only the minimum
code (that is, the code required to accept and identify messages) loaded
at application startup, and placing all processing function into dynamic
link libraries that are loaded only when one of their entry points is called.

<P>
Application developers must give careful consideration to correct partitioning
of the application. Groups of functions that are interdependent and which
call one another, or are typically called in close sequence should be placed
in a single DLL module.  Functions that are independent of one another should
be placed in separate DLLs.  This approach will minimize the load time and
memory requirements of the application.
