<P>
A queue can be used to pass information between the process that created
it and other processes in the system.  The process that creates the queue
is known as the owner of the queue, and is the only process that can read
 and remove elements from the queue.  Other processes may only add  elements
to the queue.
<P>
In a client-server environment, a queue is typically created by the  server
process.  If a requester wishes to receive returned data from  the server
process, it must therefore create its own queue.  <A HREF="094_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Queues (Part 1)"</A> shows a requester
process using the <B> DosCreateQueue()</B> function to create its own queue,
as well as using a queue owned by a server process.
<P>
Queues may be created with a number of different ordering mechanisms.  The
order of elements in a queue is determined when the queue is  created, and
may be specified as FIFO, LIFO, or priority-based.  When  adding an element
to a priority-based queue, a process must specify a  priority (from 0 to
15 with 0 being lowest and 15 being highest) for  the element.
<P>
Processes other than a queue's owner may gain write access to the  queue
using the<B> DosOpenQueue()</B> function to obtain a queue handle.  Once
this handle is obtained, the process  may use the<B> DosWriteQueue()</B> function
to add elements to the queue.  The example in <A HREF="094_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Queues (Part 1)"</A> shows  a requester
process that passes a request to a server process using a  queue created
by that server process.
<P>
The requester process first creates its own queue for returned data,  using
the<B> DosCreateQueue()</B> function.  This queue will be  accessed by the
server to write the returned data from the completed  request, which can
then be read by the requester.  The example shown in <A HREF="095_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Queues (Part 2)"</A> creates a FIFO queue
with the name specified in the  string constant REQQUENAME, and specifies
that the addresses of any  elements placed in the queue by 16-bit processes
are to be  automatically converted to 32-bit addresses by the operating
system.  This conversion, specified using the QUE_CONVERT_ADDRESS flag,
is used by 32-bit queue owners to avoid the need for the queue owner to
explicitly convert addresses.
<P>
The requester obtains access to the server's queue using the<B> DosOpenQueue()
</B>function, passing the queue name as a parameter.  This function returns
both a queue handle and the process identifier of the server process that
owns the queue.
<P>
The requester must allocate a shared memory object to contain the  request;
the actual queue element contains only a pointer to that  memory object.
The requester then invokes the <B> DosGiveSharedMem()</B> function to provide
read-only access (by  specifying only the PAG_READ flag) to that object
for the server  process, using the process identifier returned by the<B> DosOpenQueue()
</B>function.
<P>
The requester adds its request as a element in the queue, using the<B> DosWriteQueue()
</B>function.  Note that the second parameter to  the function is an unsigned
long integer, which may be used to pass application-specific information.
 The value specified in this  parameter is passed to the queue owner as
the<I> ulData</I> field  of a REQUESTDATA structure, which is returned by
the <B> DosReadQueue()</B> function.  In this example, the parameter is
 used to pass the window handle of the requester's object window to the
 server process, so that a notification message can be passed to the  requester
when the request has been completed.
<P>
Once the element has been written to the queue, the requester  immediately
relinquishes access to the server's queue by issuing a <B> DosCloseQueue()
</B>function call.  The shared memory object allocated for the request buffer
is  then released by the requester using the<B> DosFreeMem()</B>  function.

<P>
The server process is very similar in structure to the requester, in that
it creates its own queue, then awaits and services requests.  The server
process is illustrated in <A HREF="095_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Queues (Part 2)"</A>.
<P>
Note that the server process<I> does not</I> use an object window.  It simply
accepts requests from its own queue, using the DCWW_WAIT flag  to suspend
itself in the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> call until an  element becomes available
in the queue.  Once a request is complete, the server places the returned
data on the requester's queue, extracts the window handle of the requester
from the REQUESTDATA structure  provided by the<B> DosReadQueue()</B> call,
and posts a message to the requester indicating that the request is complete.
This message is processed by the requester to retrieve the returned data
from the queue. <A HREF="341_L3_Queuescontinued.html">Continue</A> on the
