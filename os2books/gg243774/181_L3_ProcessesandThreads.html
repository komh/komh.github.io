<H1>Processes and Threads</H1><!-- entering slot 188 -->
<P>
The term<I> task</I> (as in multitasking) refers to a hardware-defined task
state. While OS/2 supports multitasking, it does not directly use the concept
of a task as defined by the Intel 80386 processor architecture.  Instead,
OS/2 makes a differentiation between <A HREF="655_L2_process.html"><B>processes
</B></A>and <A HREF="698_L2_thread.html"><B>threads</B></A>.
<P>
<B>Processes</B>
<P>
A process is most easily defined as a program executing in the system. Since
it is possible for a single program to be invoked multiple times in a multitasking
system such as OS/2, multiple processes may be executing the same program,
and each such process is known as an <A HREF="565_L2_executioninstance.html"><I>execution
instance</I></A> of the program.  A process owns system resources such as
threads, file handles etc, and a memory map that describes the region of
memory owned by that process.  Since each process owns its own resources
and memory map, which are administered by the operating system on behalf
of the process, the resources of one process are protected from access by
any other process. In situations where communication between processes is
required, OS/2 provides a number of architected mechanisms by which they
may be achieved. These mechanisms are described in <A HREF="182_L3_InterprocessCommunic.html">Interprocess
Communication and Synchronization</A>.
<P>
<B>Threads</B>
<P>
A thread is the unit of dispatching for the operating system's scheduler,
and therefore equates closely with the notion of an 80386 task as defined
by the processor architecture.  Each thread is owned by a process, and a
single process may have multiple threads.  When a process is created, one
thread (known as the <A HREF="652_L2_primarythread.html"><I>primary thread
</I></A>) is always created to run the code specified in the process creation
system call.  Thus a process always has at least one thread.  Secondary
threads are often used to perform lengthy operations such as document formatting,
remote communications etc, thereby allowing the primary thread to continue
interaction with the user. <A HREF="674_L2_secondarythread.html"><I>Secondary
threads</I></A> may be created and terminated at any time during execution
of a process.  When the primary thread of a process is terminated, the process
itself terminates.
<P>
A thread executes for a short period of time before the operating system's
scheduler preempts the thread and gains control.  The scheduler may then
determine that there is some other thread that ought to run; if so, the
scheduler saves the task state of the current thread and dispatches the
new thread, which executes for a period of time until it too is preempted
and control returns to the scheduler.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 supports up to 4096 threads within the system.  Note that
this limit includes those threads used by the operating system and by applications
executing under operating system control, such as the print spooler.  The
number of threads available to applications will therefore be somewhat less
than 4096.
<P>
Since each thread is owned by a process, all threads within that process
share the resources and memory map belonging to that process, and thus have
access to those resources.  OS/2 does not protect memory resources from
being accessed by multiple threads within the same process; this is the
responsibility of the application developer.  However, OS/2 provides a number
of architected mechanisms to aid the application developer in maintaining
the integrity of the application's resources.
