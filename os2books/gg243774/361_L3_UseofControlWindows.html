<H1>Use of Control Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 400 -->
<P>
A number of control window classes are provided by Presentation Manager.
 Under CUA guidelines, these control windows should be displayed in standard
windows, although their use is more typically in dialog boxes.  This is
in accordance with the convention that windows display objects or the contents
of objects, and other more structured information such as object attributes
is displayed in a dialog box.  See also the proviso regarding listboxes
under <A HREF="352_L2_StandardWindows.html">Standard Windows</A>. The use
of control windows is defined in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture
CUA Advanced Guide to User Interface Design</I>. However, there are some
emerging conventions as to the exact interpretation of the CUA  guidelines,
and these are discussed in the following sections.
<P>
<B>Entry Field</B>
<P>
Entry fields are used where textual or numeric data is required from the
user, and where the set of possible entries is open-ended.  Examples of
such data items include file names, object descriptions etc.
<P>
<B>List Box</B>
<P>
A listbox is used to display a list of objects, where the contents of that
list may change from one execution to the next, based upon various external
or user-specified criteria.  One or more items may be selected from a listbox.
The listbox is typically created with a size sufficient to display a certain
number of items, and a scroll bar is provided if the number of items increases
such that not all items may be displayed at once.
<P>
Note that a listbox should not be used to display a set of choices where
that set is finite and unchanging.  In such a case, radio buttons  may be
used where the choices are mutually exclusive, or check boxes  used where
more than one choice may be made concurrently.
<P>
<B>Combo Box</B>
<P>
A combo box, also known as a<I> prompted entry field</I> is a combination
of the  entry field and listbox control window styles, and is supported
by  Presentation Manager in OS/2 Version 1.2 and above.  A combo box is
used where textual or numeric data is required from a user, where the set
of possible entries is finite, and where the application wishes to prompt
the user for a valid entry.  A combo box may be of three distinct types:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<B> simple</B> combo box is displayed as an entry
field with a  listbox directly below it.  The user may enter textual or
numeric data  into the entry field in the same way as for a normal entry
field, or  may select an item from the listbox.  The selected item will
then appear in the entry field.  The simple combo box provides a similar
function to that of a single-selection listbox.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<B> drop-down</B> combo box is displayed as an entry
field with an icon to its immediate right.  The user may enter textual or
numeric data into the entry field, or may select the icon.  When selected,
the icon causes a listbox to appear below the entry field, containing a
list of valid entries for the entry field.  When selected,  an item appears
in the listbox.  The drop-down combo box is recommended where the set of
valid entries is finite and limited, but where the user may already know
the required entry and may wish to save time by entering it him/herself.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<B> drop-down list</B> combo box is displayed in
a similar manner to a drop-down combo box, as an entry field with an icon
to its immediate right.  However, the user may not enter data directly into
the entry field, but must select an item from the listbox.  A drop-down
list combo box is recommended in situations where a number of control windows
are located in a dialog box, where the optimization of space is of primary
importance, and where the default entry is likely to be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The use of a combo box is typically recommended in place of a listbox in
order to save room within a dialog box, or in place of an entry field where
the application wishes to prompt a user with a list of valid entries.
<P>
<B>Radio Button</B>
<P>
Radio buttons are used to indicate a group of mutually exclusive options;
 that is, only one of the items in the group is selectable at any one time,
and selecting one item automatically deselects any previously selected item.
 Selecting a radio button does not<!-- entering slot 401 --> complete the
dialog; a user may revise his/her selection any number of times during the
dialog.  Once a final decision is made, the user completes the dialog using
a push button (see below).
<P>
Radio buttons are always displayed in groups; it makes no sense to have
a single mutually exclusive selection item.  Text is displayed along with
the buttons to indicate the choice represented by each button.  If multiple
groups of radio buttons are present within a dialog box or window, or if
radio buttons are combined with other types  of control window, it is recommended
for reasons of clarity that the  radio buttons be placed within a group
box, and that this group box be  named to indicate the nature or purpose
of the group as a whole.
<P>
As described above, radio buttons should be used to denote a set of mutually
exclusive options in the creation or manipulation of an object, as part
of a more complex dialog.  They should not be used to present a set of options
in response to an application or system event,  where this set of options
is the sole purpose of the dialog.  In such  cases, a message box is the
preferred mechanism to achieve this type of communication with the user,
since the processing overhead associated  with a message box is less than
that associated with a dialog box.  For example, a warning that the user
is about to exit the application  without saving his/her latest set of changes
would be presented using a  message box rather than a dialog box with radio
buttons.
<P>
The equivalent function of a group of radio buttons may also be provided
by a pulldown menu displaying a set of options, only one of which may be
selected at any one time, with the selected item indicated by a check mark.
 The use of  a pulldown menu is the recommended option in situations where
the selection of an option is the only action to be performed.  The use
of radio buttons is recommended where the selection of an option indicated
 by the radio buttons is part of a more complex dialog.
<P>
Note that from a programming viewpoint, "auto" radio buttons should be used
in preference to standard radio buttons since these buttons are drawn and
maintained by Presentation Manager.  The application need not concern itself
with redrawing the buttons when their state changes, thereby allowing simpler
programming.
<P>
<B>Check Box</B>
<P>
A check box is used to indicate a single option that may be toggled on or
off by the user.  Multiple check boxes may appear in a single dialog box
or window, and may refer to different attributes of the same object.  However,
these attributes are related to each other only by their application to
that same object, and should not be mutually exclusive.
<P>
A<B> 3-state</B> button is a special type of check box that, in addition
to being marked selected or non-selected, may be "grayed out" to indicate
that a choice is non-selectable in the current dialog.  A 3-state button
should be used whenever a dialog box is applicable to a range of objects,
but where certain options within the dialog box are not valid for all objects
dealt with by that dialog box.  A 3-state button may be enabled or disabled
using the<B> WinEnableWindow()</B> function, obtaining the window handle
of the button from a<B> WinWindowFromID()</B> call.
<P>
The equivalent function to a check box may be provided by a pulldown  menu
displaying a list of options, from which multiple items may be selected
 at any one time, with the selected items indicated by check marks.  The
 use of a pulldown menu is recommended where the selection of such an  option
is the only action to be performed.  The use of a check box or  3-state
button is the preferred solution where the selection is part of  a more
complex dialog.
<P>
Note that the "auto" versions of check boxes and 3-state buttons should
be used in preference to the standard versions, since the auto versions
are maintained by Presentation Manager, and the application need not concern
itself with redrawing these buttons when their state changes.
<P>
<B>Push Button</B>
<P>
Push buttons are used to initiate an immediate action by the application.
 If desired, push buttons can be used in conjunction with the menu bar and
context menu, to provide easy access to commonly used functions in both
primary windows and action windows.
<P>
Push buttons should not be used to form<!-- entering slot 402 --> menus
of selectable options that cause child windows to appear when a push button
is selected.  Such a practice effectively forms a hierarchical user interface,
which is in violation of object-oriented user interface principles.
<P>
An exception to this rule is a "Help" push button, which immediately displays
a window containing help information, while maintaining the previous window
or dialog on the screen.  Dismissing the help window returns the user to
the original window in which the "Help" push button was displayed.
<P>
<B>Slider</B>
<P>
The slider is used where a single value must be selected from a continuous
range of options.  For example, the brightness of the screen, the saturation
of a color or the speed of the mouse cursor on the screen are all values
selected from a continuous, though finite, range of options.
<P>
Under previous versions of OS/2, scroll bars were often used to provide
a portion of the slider's functionality.  The provision of the slider control
under OS/2 Version 2.0 allows the scroll bar to be used<I> only</I> for
its intended purpose of scrolling information within a window; this improves
the consistency of the user interface and removes a potential source of
user confusion.
<P>
<B>Value Set</B>
<P>
The value set control is used in a similar way to a set of radio buttons,
to indicate a group of mutually exclusive options.  Many of the comments
made for radio buttons apply equally to value sets.
<P>
However, while the use of radio buttons is effectively limited to text items,
a value set allows the use of text or graphical items, as well as color
patches.  Thus a value set provides additional flexibility where a selection
must be made from a set of mutually exclusive options, providing a mechanism
for the display of those options to the user, and allowing the user to directly
select the required choice.
