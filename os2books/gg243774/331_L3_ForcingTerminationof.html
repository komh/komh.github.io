<H1>Forcing Termination of a Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 365 -->
<P>
In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to terminate a secondary thread
without waiting for the thread to complete its processing; for example,
the user may decide to exit from the  application.  This capability is provided
under OS/2 Version 2.0 using the<B> DosKillThread()</B> function.  This
function is illustrated in <A HREF="088_L2_DosKillThreadFunctio.html">Figure
"DosKillThread() Function"</A>.
<P>
Note that the<B> DosKillThread()</B> function cannot be used to  terminate
the current thread; if the application attempts to issue a<B> DosKillThread()
</B>function call for the current thread, the function will return an error.
To terminate a secondary thread from within that thread, the<B> _endthread()
</B>function should be used  if the thread was created with the<B> _beginthread()
</B>function,  or the<B> DosExit()</B> function may be used if the thread
was  created using the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function.
