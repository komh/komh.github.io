<P>
Header files should be used wherever possible in order to isolate data and
function declarations from the application code, thereby enhancing modularity
and improving readability.
<P>
For management purposes and to facilitate subsequent maintenance of the
application code, a header file should include a prolog identifying the
application and source module with which it is associated, its author and
owner, and whether the header file is a private, public, global or generic
header file (see below for definitions of these terms).
