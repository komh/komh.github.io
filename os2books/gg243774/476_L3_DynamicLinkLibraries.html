<H1>Dynamic Link Libraries</H1><!-- entering slot 519 -->
<P>
The following routines and objects should, wherever possible, be placed
in dynamic link libraries:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Those application objects that have been identified
as having potential for future reuse by other applications<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Those routines identified as generic routines, which
will be accessed from more than one window procedure<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Those Presentation Manager resources (for example,
dialog definitions, along with their associated dialog procedures) that
are accessed from multiple window procedures within the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The placement of such items in dynamic link libraries enhances their independence
from the application's code, enabling changes to be made without affecting
the code or requiring application maintenance.  In addition, placement in
dynamic link libraries facilitates reuse of such items by multiple applications.
 It is thus possible to achieve object code reuse at both the application
object and at the subroutine level.
<P>
To this end, all items placed in dynamic link libraries should have their
external interfaces documented, baselined and included in an Interface Control
Document, for subsequent use as development library routines.  It is the
responsibility of the development organization to establish procedures for
the testing and acceptance of reusable code modules into libraries from
which they may subsequently be accessed by application developers, and the
creation of a repository of documentation detailing the application objects
that are available, their behavior and external interfaces.
