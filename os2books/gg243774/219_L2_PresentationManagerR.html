<P>
Presentation Manager allows the application developer to define application
<B>resources</B> externally to the application code.  Resources may include
definitions for the following items:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Fonts</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Graphic fonts may be created and modified
using the<B> Font Editor</B> supplied as part of the<I> IBM Developer's
Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Icons</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Application
and window icons, mouse-pointers and bitmaps may be created and modified
using the<B> Icon Editor</B> supplied as part of the<I> IBM Developer's
Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Menus</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Menu
bars and pulldown menus may be defined for display windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> String
Tables</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Tables of text strings may be defined
for use by an application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Accelerator Tables
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL>Tables of accelerator keys (for example, F3
for Quit) may be defined for display windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Help
Tables</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Tables of help panels may be defined
for each display window or each control window in a dialog box.  See <A HREF="397_L1_AddingOnlineHelpandD.html">Adding
Online Help and Documentation</A> for further discussion of help panels.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Dialog Templates</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Dialog
boxes may be created or modified and stored as dialog templates, using the
<A HREF="545_L2_DialogBoxEditor.html"><B>Dialog Box Editor</B></A> supplied
as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Window
Templates</B><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Window templates may be created or
modified and stored as window templates, using the dialog editor supplied
as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Except where noted above, resources are defined in a <A HREF="669_L2_resourcescriptfile.html"><B>resource
script file</B></A>, an ASCII text file that may be manipulated using a
standard text editor. This resource script file serves as input to a <A HREF="668_L2_resourcecompiler.html"><B>resource
compiler</B></A>, which is provided as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit
for OS/2 2.0</I>.  The resource compiler produces a precompiled version
of the resources, which is then incorporated into the application's executable
code or stored in a dynamic link library for use by one or more applications.

<P>
It is usual for simple text-based resources such as menus and string tables
to be placed directly into the resource script file using an ASCII text
editor.  However, non-textual resources such as icons or bitmaps, or more
complex text-based resources such as dialog templates, are typically stored
in separate files and referenced from the resource script file.
<P>
A major benefit of defining such resources externally to the application
is that changes may be made to resource definitions without affecting the
application code itself.  Modifications such as new icons, altered commands
or menus, etc., may be implemented quickly and easily by making simple changes
at a single point in the application.
<P>
As a further example, the task of providing national language versions of
an application is simplified, since all text such as menus and messages
may be defined outside the application code, and multiple language-specific
versions of such resources may be linked into a single version of the application
code.  In this way, the user interface properties of a display window may
be modified without affecting the internal implementation of the window
procedure or its methods.
<P>
The creation and use of Presentation Manager resources is discussed in <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation
