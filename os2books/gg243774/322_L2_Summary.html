<P>
It can be seen that Presentation Manager provides the mechanism by which
an application developer may externally define the user interface properties
of his/her application.  This ability provides the benefit that these external
properties may be modified, or different versions substituted, without the
need to modify the application code itself.  In addition, standard user
interface objects such as icons, pointers and dialog boxes, along with their
associated dialog routines, may be defined and stored in dynamic link libraries
for use by multiple applications.
<P>
Resources are defined using a resource script file, which is an ASCII text
file containing definitions for text-based resources and references to other
files that contain definitions for non-textual resources such as pointers
and icons.  The resource script file is used as input to the resource compiler,
which compiles resource definitions and incorporates them into an executable
module.
<P>
Resources may be incorporated into the application's main .EXE file, or
may be stored in a dynamic link library and loaded into memory using run-time
dynamic linking.  Application procedures such as dialog procedures, which
are associated with such resources, may also be defined and stored in the
same DLL module, thus providing the opportunity to create libraries of standard
resources, including standard dialogs, which may be used by multiple applications.
