<P>
Subroutines may be accessed from within a Workplace Shell object, in much
the same manner as from any other program.  Normal programming language
calling conventions are used.  Subroutines used by the object may reside
within the same DLL as the object itself, or may be in a different DLL.

<P>
A number of guidelines for the use of subroutines within Presentation Manager
applications are given in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>.  Note that similar guidelines
apply to the use of subroutines within Workplace Shell objects, since these
objects should also adhere to object-oriented programming principles.
