<P>
A <A HREF="625_L2_multiprogramming.html"><B>multiprogramming</B></A> operating
system allows the concurrent execution of multiple applications in the same
machine.  A <A HREF="626_L2_multitasking.html"><B>multitasking</B></A> operating
system is an extension of the multiprogramming concept, which distributes
processor time among multiple applications by giving each application access
to the processor for short periods of time.  OS/2 implements both multiprogramming
and multitasking.
<P>
Multitasking may be supported in two forms:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="534_L2_cooperativemultitask.html"><B>Cooperative
multitasking</B></A> requires the active support of applications running
in the system, which must explicitly relinquish control of the processor
to allow other applications to execute.  This form of multitasking is unreliable
and frequently leads to poor performance, since an ill-behaved application
can monopolize the processor.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="648_L2_preemptivemultitaski.html"><B>Pre-emptive
multitasking</B></A> uses a <A HREF="673_L2_scheduler.html"><I>scheduler
</I></A>as part of the operating system; the scheduler is responsible for
selectively dispatching and suspending multiple concurrent tasks in the
system.  This form of multitasking is more sophisticated, typically leads
to greater overall system throughput, and allows implementation of priority
dispatching schemes for various tasks.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Numerous mechanisms exist for providing multiprogramming support under DOS;
these include products such as Microsoft Windows.  However, since such facilities
are ultimately dependent upon the single-tasking architecture of the DOS
operating system, they typically provide only limited multitasking capabilities;
where pre-emptive multitasking is supported, schedulers are typically primitive
and performance is relatively poor.  Pre-emptive multitasking is not possible
during input/output operations, since these operations are performed by
the single-tasking DOS operating system.
<P>
OS/2 provides pre-emptive multitasking under the control of the operating
system, which is designed to use the multitasking protected mode of the
Intel 80286 and 80386 processors.  OS/2 implements a pre-emptive task scheduler
with a multi-level priority scheme, which provides dynamic variation of
priority and round-robin dispatching within each priority level.  The dynamic
variation of priority is achieved on the basis of current activity, and
is intended to improve overall system performance and ensure that the system
as a whole responds adequately to user interactions. For circumstances where
dynamic variation of priority is inappropriate, the dynamic variation may
be disabled using a command in the CONFIG.SYS file, and task priority then
becomes absolute.  In either case, task priority may be set and altered
dynamically using a number of operating system functions available to OS/2
application programmers.
<P>
The management of tasks executing in the system is further simplified and
streamlined under OS/2 Version 2.0.  This is due primarily to the fact that
support for processes executing in real mode (such as the DOS Compatibility
Box in OS/2 Version 1.3) is no longer required, since the execution of DOS
applications is supported using virtual DOS machines which run as protected
mode processes.  See <A HREF="183_L2_DOSApplicationSuppor.html">DOS Application
Support</A> for further information.
