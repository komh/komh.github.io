<H1>Control Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 271 -->
<P>
As mentioned in <A HREF="351_L1_SystemsApplicationAr.html">Systems Application
Architecture CUA Considerations</A>, control windows are typically used
in dialog boxes, and are hence accessed from the dialog procedure associated
with their parent dialog box.  Such communication is synchronous in nature,
since it usually involves insertion or retrieval of data into or from control
windows, or other tasks that are part of the modal dialog with the user.

<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, some additional functions have been introduced into
the Presentation Manager programming interface, to ease more complex communications,
such as those involving list boxes.  Since communication with list boxes
is therefore somewhat different from that involving other control window
classes, list boxes are discussed separately in List Boxes below.
<P>
<B>General Control Windows</B>
<P>
Communication between a dialog procedure and the control windows associated
with its dialog box is typically achieved using the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()
</B>function, which is documented in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation
Manager Reference</I>.  This function  is similar in function and behavior
to the<B> WinSendMsg()</B>  function, in that it passes a synchronous message
to the destination  window.  However, instead of accepting the handle of
the destination  window as its first parameter, it accepts the handle of
the control  window's parent and the window identifier of the control window
itself  as the first two parameters of the call.  For example, to send a
 message of class EM_SETTEXTLIMIT to an entry field named EF_PRODNAME,  which
is a child of the dialog box with handle<I> hDlgBox</I>, the function call
shown in <A HREF="033_L2_CommunicatingwithaCo.html">Figure "Communicating
with a Control Window"</A> is used.
<P>
It is possible to perform an equivalent function using the<B> WinSendMsg()
</B>call, by obtaining the control window's handle using the<B> WinWindowFromID()
</B>function.  However, for purposes of standardization and in accordance
with emerging conventions, it is recommended that the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()
</B>function be used to send messages to control windows.  Note that for
this purpose, the definition of control  windows includes both the system
menu and menu bar; messages sent to  these menus (in order to insert, modify
or delete items) should be sent  using the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()</B> function.

<P>
Similarly, it is recommended that the<B> WinSetDlgItemText()</B> and<B> WinQueryDlgItemText()
</B>functions be used to set and query the contents of control windows from
within the application.  For example, assume that the user has completed
interaction with a dialog box, and pressed the "Enter" or "OK" button, and
the application wishes to obtain the contents of an entry field named EF_PRODNAME,
which is child of the dialog box with  handle<I> hDlgBox</I>.  The function
call call shown in <A HREF="034_L2_QueryingInformationF.html">Figure "Querying
Information From a Control Window"</A> is used.
<P>
The<B> WinQueryDlgItemText()</B> function copies the contents of the entry
field into the string<I> szBuffer</I>, and returns the number of characters
copied.
<P>
The<B> WinSetDlgItemText()</B> function is typically used in situations
where some of the information necessary to complete an action is known;
this information is then displayed in the appropriate entry fields within
the dialog box, and the user fills in the missing fields.  Another use of
this function is to provide default values for entry fields.  Both the<B> WinSetDlgItemText()
</B>and<B> WinQueryDlgItemText()</B> functions are documented in the<I> IBM
OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
<B>List Boxes</B>
<P>
The complexity of communication with list boxes has been greatly reduced
under OS/2 Version 2.0.  The Presentation Manager programming interface
now includes a number of functions that allow most communication requirements
to be achieved in a single step.  Note that these functions may also be
used for communication with a combo box (prompted entry field).
<P>
Insertion and deletion of list box items is carried out using the<B><!-- entering slot 272 --> WinInsertLboxItem()
</B>and<B> WinDeleteLboxItem()</B> functions, which are new to OS/2 Version
2.0.  The<B> WinInsertLboxItem()</B> function is illustrated in <A HREF="035_L2_InsertinganItemIntoa.html">Figure
"Inserting an Item Into a List Box"</A>.
<P>
An application may obtain the text of a selected item in the list box using
the<B> WinQueryLboxSelectedItem()</B> and<B> WinQueryLboxItemText()</B> functions.
 The use of these functions is illustrated in <A HREF="036_L2_QueryingaSelectedLis.html">Figure
"Querying a Selected List Box Item"</A>.
<P>
Other functions include the<B> WinQueryLboxCount()</B> function, which returns
the number of items in a list box, and the<B> WinQueryLboxItemTextLength()
</B>function, which returns the length of list box item's text.
<P>
All of these list box manipulation functions are described in the<I> IBM
OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
