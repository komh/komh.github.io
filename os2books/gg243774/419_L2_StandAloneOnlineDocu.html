<H1>Stand-Alone Online Documentation</H1><!-- entering slot 461 -->
<P>
Panels containing text produced using IPF need not be called from an application;
IPF can be used to produce "stand-alone" online documentation, which is
viewed using the VIEW.EXE utility provided with OS/2 Version 2.0.  Online
documents have similar capabilities to help libraries; both text and graphics
may be included, and hypertext and hypergraphic links are supported.
<P>
Online documents also have a number of differences from help libraries:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->In an online document, a panel may be identified by
using the<I> name=</I> or<I> id=</I> attributes in the heading, rather than
the<I> res=</I> attribute.  These attributes allow the use of alphanumeric
characters, where the<I> res=</I> attribute must specify an integer identifier.
 Links are then defined using the<I> refid=</I> attribute in the<I> :link
</I>tag.
<P>
Note that the<I> name=</I> or<I> id=</I> attributes may not be used if files
will be concatenated and hypertext or hypergraphic links are required between
files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Online documents may not use hypertext or hypergraphic
links with<I> reftype=inform</I>, since there is no associated application
for the help instance, and IPF cannot determine the window to which the
message should be directed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->An online document has a main window created by IPF,
which contains the table of contents for the document.  The title of this
main window is determined by a<I> :title</I> tag.
<P>
Note that the :title tag may only be used for online documents, and not
for help libraries.  The title of an application's main help window is specified
in the<B> WinCreateHelpInstance()</B> function call.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The ability to include hypertext and hypergraphics in online documents allows
the creation of online procedure manuals that automatically invoke the appropriate
application or applications for each step of the procedure. This is achieved
by defining the hypertext or hypergraphic items with<I> reftype=launch</I>,
specifying the name of the executable file for the required application.
 See <A HREF="423_L2_SelfTeachingApplicat.html">Self-Teaching Applications
</A>for further discussion of such applications.
