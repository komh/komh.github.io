<P>
Where a secondary thread is created only to process a specific  event, and
where the thread terminates upon completion of that event,  communication
between the primary and secondary threads is usually not  required. Necessary
data is communicated to the secondary thread as  part of the<B> DosCreateThread()
</B>function, including pointers to the data objects upon which the thread
must operate.  The secondary thread then proceeds to process the event,
independently of the primary thread.
<P>
The only communication from the secondary thread to the primary  thread
occurs upon completion of the event, when the secondary thread  signals
this completion to the primary thread.  Completion may be  signalled by
Presentation Manager messages or via semaphores; see <A HREF="343_L2_MaintainingSynchroni.html">Maintaining
Synchronization</A> for further discussion.
