<H1>Preface</H1><!-- entering slot 165 -->
<P>
This document is intended as a general introduction to the concepts involved
in the design and implementation of applications which will execute in the
OS/2 Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell environments under OS/2 Version
2.0.  It is not intended to be an exhaustive reference on the subject of
Presentation Manager programming, and should be used in conjunction with
the official IBM product documentation, and other reference books and documents,
which are mentioned herein.
<P>
It must be stressed that this document is not intended to teach the reader
how to program in the "C" language or how to use the Presentation Manager
programming interface, nor is it intended to teach the theory of object-oriented
programming.  Rather, it serves as a guide to the integration of various
object-oriented software engineering techniques with the Presentation Manager
application model, in order to produce well-structured, easily-maintainable
applications which conform to CUA  guidelines.
<P>
The information given in this document is generally independent of programming
language implementations (with certain exceptions noted in the text), and
may be used to develop applications in any supported programming language.
 However, programming syntax examples used in this document are shown using
the "C" language, since this language is commonly used for Presentation
Manager application development, and most clearly illustrates the structure
of the Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell application models.
<P>
This document is intended for:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
