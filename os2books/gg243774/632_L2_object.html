object
<P>
A collection of data and methods (procedures) that operate on that data,
which together represent a logical entity in the system.  In object-oriented
programming, objects are grouped into classes that share common data definitions
and methods.  Each object in the class is said to be an instance of the
class.  See also instance, object class, data object, application object.
