<P>
As mentioned throughout this document, the Presentation Manager application
model promotes the reuse of application objects, by facilitating code modularity
through data abstraction and encapsulation. With correct design procedures,
it is possible to create generic application objects that may be used by
multiple applications.  Should subsequent applications require modification
to allow different processing of particular message classes, this may be
achieved through subclassing. The Workplace Shell application model introduced
in OS/2 Version 2.0 provides even more potential for reuse, due to its enhanced
support of inheritance and subsequently enhanced provision for object reuse.

<P>
Standardization and reuse of application code promotes consistency between
applications in terms of processing techniques and user interfaces, and
helps to enforce organizational programming and interface design standards.
It also reduces the amount of new code required for applications, potentially
shortening development time, and the use of previously developed and tested
code may also decrease application testing time.
<P>
In situations where reusability at the application object level is either
not possible or impractical, common application functions may still be developed
as subroutines, and placed in libraries for access by multiple applications.
 The use of such subroutines reduces application development time.
<P>
This chapter examines the creation of such generic objects and subroutines
within the Presentation Manager application model, and their placement in
dynamic link libraries for subsequent use by applications.  Since Workplace
Shell objects are by definition placed in DLLs and available for reuse,
they are not explicitly discussed in this chapter.
