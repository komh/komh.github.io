<P>
The Presentation Manager environment provides the application developer
with a rich set of functions that enable tasks to be performed in a variety
of ways. However, within the general Presentation Manager application model,
there are a number of considerations which, if observed, enable the design
and development of applications that comply more closely with the guidelines
and emerging conventions of the Systems Application Architecture CUA component.
 This  chapter will discuss some of the considerations involved in designing
 an object-oriented, CUA-conforming Presentation Manager application.
<P>
The Presentation Manager programming interface enables the creation and
manipulation of windows in a variety of ways by an application developer.
 However, there is considerable value in adopting a series of standard practices
for developing Presentation Manager applications, from the viewpoint of
consistency and ease of maintenance, and to enhance the degree of conformance
to SAA CUA guidelines.  The following points provide some guidelines on
the interpretation of CUA specifications, and outline some emerging trends
in the development of applications that use the Presentation Manager user
interface.
