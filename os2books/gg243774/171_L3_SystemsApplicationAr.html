<P>
While Presentation Manager supports and facilitates the implementation of
object-oriented design techniques and provides support for the user interface
constructs and guidelines laid down by the CUA component of Systems Application
Architecture, it does not force an application developer to conform to object-oriented
design principles or CUA-conforming user interface guidelines.  While the
rich function set provided by the Presentation Manager programming interface
allows an application developer to interpret and implement CUA guidelines
in a number of ways, there are emerging conventions with regard to the implementation
of these guidelines.
<P>
In order to achieve the benefits which accrue from adherence to object-oriented
and CUA principles, a measure of discipline is required on the part of the
application developer, so as to implement the application in such a way
that the maximum degree of object-independence and reusability is attained,
and that the optimal level of conformance to CUA conventions is achieved.
 The subject of CUA conformance is discussed in detail in <A HREF="351_L1_SystemsApplicationAr.html">Systems
Application Architecture CUA Considerations</A>.
<P>
Note that CUA conformance, along with consistency in the implementation
of application functions and user interface constructs, may be enforced
or enhanced through the use of standard functions and subroutines contained
in code libraries.  The creation of such libraries is facilitated by the
modular nature of the Presentation Manager environment, and by the dynamic
linking capabilities of the OS/2 operating system.  This subject is discussed
further in <A HREF="438_L1_GenericApplicationMo.html">Generic Application
Modules</A>.
