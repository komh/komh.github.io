<H1>Data Structures Used in Drag/Drop</H1><!-- entering slot 322 -->
<P>
Three structures contain the data that travels with an item while it is
being dragged; these are the DRAGINFO, DRAGITEM and DRAGIMAGE structures.
 A further structure, the DRAGTRANSFER structure, is used to transfer information
between source and target windows after a drop has occurred.
<P>
Details of the fields within these structures can be found in the<I> IBM
OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>, and full descriptions
will not be given here.  However, the following sections describe in general
terms the kind of data the structures contain, and particularly certain
critical fields.
