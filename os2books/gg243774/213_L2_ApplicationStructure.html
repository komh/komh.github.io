<H1>Application Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 225 -->
<P>
All Presentation Manager applications have a similar structure.  The application
is composed of a main routine, which performs initialization and termination
functions, and which contains the application's main message processing
loop, and a number of window procedures that process messages for window
classes created and/or used by the application.  These window procedures
are invoked and messages passed to them by Presentation Manager on behalf
of the application, as shown in <A HREF="012_L2_MessageFlowinaPresen.html">Figure
"Message Flow in a Presentation Manager Application"</A>.
<P>
Window procedures may also pass messages between one another in order to
communicate events.  The flow of messages between the window procedures
is also controlled by Presentation Manager on behalf of the application.
