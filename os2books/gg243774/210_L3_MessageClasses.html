<H1>Message Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 222 -->
<P>
Messages are grouped into <A HREF="616_L2_messageclass.html"><B>message
classes</B></A>, with each class representing a particular type of event
such as character input, mouse movement, etc.  Many message classes are
defined by Presentation Manager, and messages of these classes are usually
dispatched by Presentation Manager to inform an application of system-initiated
events.  These system-defined message classes are described, along with
the default processing provided by Presentation Manager for each class,
in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
An application developer may define additional message classes unique to
his or her particular application, for use by that application. Application-defined
messages typically serve as a means of communication between windows, where
one window passes information to another window, for processing by the window
procedure associated with that window.  The destination window may then
return a message to the calling window indicating completion, or may pass
a message to a third window to trigger an additional action, dependent upon
the requirements and design of the application.
<P>
For example, the user may elect to update a file by selecting an item from
a menu bar.  The window procedure associated with the display window to
which the menu bar belongs may pass a message to an object window associated
with the file to be updated.  The window procedure for this window would
make the change and then pass a message to a third object window, which
logs the update before passing a message back to the original window procedure
indicating that the update is complete.
<P>
Note that message classes need not be specific to a particular window class;
 messages of the same class may be passed to different window classes, with
different results depending upon the processing of that message by the window
procedure belonging to that window class.  This is in accordance with the
object-oriented principle of polymorphism.
