<P>
Data may be passed to a window upon its creation, using the<I> CtlData</I> parameter
of the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> function.  The contents of this parameter
(a 32-bit pointer) are passed  to the target window as a parameter to the
WM_CREATE message.  The contents may then be extracted from the message
parameter and used by the window procedure.
<P>
When an application wishes to pass a message between two standard windows
that currently exist, whether they are display windows or object windows,
either of two methods may be used, depending on whether the desired communication
is to be synchronous or asynchronous.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->When a synchronous message is to be passed, the<B> WinSendMsg()
</B>function is used, and the target window procedure is invoked directly
by Presentation Manager, in a similar fashion to a normal function call.
 The return code from the window procedure is passed by Presentation Manager
to the calling window procedure, where it may be interrogated and acted
upon.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->When a message is to be processed asynchronously,
the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> function is used.  In this case the message is posted
to a queue associated with the thread that created the target window, and
the return code to the calling window procedure merely indicates that the
message was successfully placed on the queue.  In order for the target window
procedure to pass a return code or acknowledgement back to the calling window
procedure, it must include another<B> WinPostMsg()</B> call as part of the
processing of the message.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The use of<B> WinPostMsg()</B> is recommended over that of<B> WinSendMsg()</B>,
since posted messages are processed in the order in which they arrive in
the queue, and the integrity of the user's intention is thus preserved in
the order of processing.  In addition, synchronous window procedures are
invoked and executed without the original window procedure completing its
processing and returning control to the message processing loop.  Thus the
application  is prevented from processing additional user interaction, which
may  lead to violation of the SAA CUA responsiveness guidelines.
