The Information Presentation Facility allows an application developer to
create online context-sensitive help panels and stand-alone online documentation
for Presentation Manager applications.  The ability to link between panels
and between a panel and applications provides a flexible and powerful tool
for developing:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The flexibility of IPF and the high level of interaction between a help
instance and its controlling application allows the application to exercise
significant control over the way in which help information is displayed
to the end user.  The ability to combine multiple viewports in a single
help window allows the simultaneous use of text, graphics and other technologies
such as image or full-motion video to provide help, documentation and tutorial
information.
