<H1>Window and Dialog Templates</H1><!-- entering slot 348 -->
<P>
Templates defining standard windows and dialog boxes may be defined within
the resource script file.  Typically, a window or dialog template is designed
using the Dialog Box Editor application supplied with the<I> IBM Developer's
Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>, and is saved in a text file with an extension
.DLG which is included in the resource script file with an<I> rcinclude
</I>statement.  A window or dialog template may also be defined directly
into the resource script file.  In either case, the template is defined
using the WINDOWTEMPLATE or DLGTEMPLATE keywords.  These keywords are actually
synonymous, and the resource compiler interprets either keyword in the same
way.
<P>
Within a single window or dialog template, there may be multiple WINDOW
or DIALOG statements that define individual windows or dialog boxes.  The
nesting of the statements defines the parent/child window hierarchy. <A HREF="078_L2_WindowTemplateResour.html">Figure
"Window Template Resource Definition"</A> shows an example of nested windows
within a window template.
<P>
The window template WCP_001 contains a frame window with the title "Window
Class X" and with size and positional coordinates as specified.  The style
attributes of the frame window are specified using the CTLDATA statement.
 The client window for this frame window is created using the WINDOW keyword
nested within the window template, with no window title, the identifier
FID_CLIENT, no size or positional coordinates (these are defined by the
frame window), the class "MyClass" and the default client style.
<P>
The use of the WINDOWTEMPLATE keyword and WINDOW statements is a useful
way for an application developer to predefine particular window types and
styles for use by one or more applications.  The template definitions may
be used to create modal dialog boxes, which are loaded into memory and executed
by the use of<B> WinLoadDlg()</B> and<B> WinProcessDlg()</B> calls.  Definitions
may also be created for standard windows or modeless dialog boxes, which
are loaded into memory using the<B> WinLoadDlg()</B> function and executed
by making the window or dialog box visible using the<B> WinShowWindow()
</B>function.
<P>
Predefinition of windows is particularly useful when applied to dialog boxes.
Here, the number and complexity of control window definitions is often such
that creating such windows dynamically is a complicated task.  A dialog
box is defined in the resource script file (or a .DLG file, which is incorporated
into the resource script file using the<I> rcinclude</I> statement) using
the DLGTEMPLATE keyword.
<P>
Within a dialog template, there may be multiple dialogs defined using the
DIALOG statement, and each dialog box may have multiple control windows
defined using CONTROL keywords.  <A HREF="079_L2_DialogTemplateResour.html">Figure
"Dialog Template Resource Definition"</A> shows an example of a dialog template
containing a dialog box with several control windows:
<P>
The dialog template is equivalent to a frame window, and is named DC_CREATE.
 This symbolic name is used to identify the dialog resource and is passed
as a parameter to the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function, which loads and processes
the dialog box.
<P>
The dialog box is defined with a title bar and a dialog border, and is also
named using the symbolic name DC_CREATE.  The dialog box contains a static
text control window providing instructions to the user, and an entry field
into which the user may enter text.  It also contains an "Enter" and a "Cancel"
pushbutton.
<P>
Note that the resource identifier for the static text string does not use
a symbolic constant, but simply has the value "-1".  This is done because
there is no need for the application to access the text string; it is merely
present as a prompt to the user.  It is therefore conventional to omit the
symbolic constant and use "-1" as the value.  Multiple text strings may
have the same value.
