<H1>Defining Help Panels</H1><!-- entering slot 442 -->
<P>
The IPF tag language contains "header" tags with levels from 1 to 6; by
default, levels 1 to 3 define the start of a new help panel, and are automatically
included in the table of contents for online documentation. Each help panel
therefore begins with one of these header tags, followed by the help text
to be displayed within that panel.

<P>
The<I> res=</I> attribute specified in the<I> :h1</I> through<I> :h6</I> tags
is used by IPF to uniquely identify the help panel, and to enable an application
to link to that panel when the user requests help.  See <A HREF="407_L2_LinkingHelpWindowsWi.html">Linking
Help Windows With Applications</A> for further information.
<P>
The<I> x=</I>,<I> y=</I>,<I> cx=</I> and<I> cy=</I> attributes define the
position and size of the window within its parent.  In the case of a help
window, the parent is the application window from which the help window
was invoked.
<P>
The header levels 1 to 3 are used when organizing help panels within the
table of contents.  Panels defined with header level 3 are grouped under
the last defined header level 2, and those defined with header level 2 are
similarly grouped under the last defined header level 1.  Thus the order
of definition within the source file<I> is</I> significant.
<P>
Note that multiple help panels may be placed within a single source file,
simply by including additional header tags.  By default, header levels 4
to 6 will not cause the display of a new help window, but will appear as
formatted subject headings within a help panel.
