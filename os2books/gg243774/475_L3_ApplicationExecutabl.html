<P>
The application's main executable file (that is, the file that is invoked
to start the application) should contain those object modules which are
required to execute the application, and that do not contain generic routines
or generic Presentation Manager resources.
<P>
Where it is envisaged that an application object is usable only by the current
application, and has no possible potential for future reuse, it may be bound
with the application's main executable file.  However, if such potential
for reuse exists, the application object should be placed in a dynamic link
library.
