<P>
Problems in Presentation Manager applications typically occur within window
procedures, or in subroutines invoked from within window procedures.  This
is not surprising, since all processing within a Presentation Manager application
takes place as a result of messages, which are received and processed by
window procedures.  However, the event-driven nature of the Presentation
Manager application model provides a built-in means of narrowing down the
location of a problem, provided the event that caused the problem can be
determined.
<P>
The initial documentation of an error may be performed by whoever is responsible
for application testing, since no great level of technical expertise is
required at this stage.  It is important that the error is effectively documented
in writing, at the time it occurs, along with relevant supporting information.
 Effective documentation greatly eases the task of recreating the error
and identifying the underlying problem.
<P>
A worksheet that may be used for problem documentation, and that records
the information required by the guidelines given in this chapter, is contained
in <A HREF="494_L1_ProblemReportingWork.html">Problem Reporting Worksheet</A>.
