<H1>Message Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 273 -->
<P>
Communication between a window or dialog procedure and a message box  is
relatively simple.  The message box is created and processed using  the
<B>WinMessageBox()</B> function, and the only input data provided to this
function is the title of the message box and the text of the message to
be displayed.  The application may affect the style of the message box,
by specifying style attributes in the function call, as described in the
<I>IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
An example of the<B> WinMessageBox()</B> function is given in <A HREF="037_L2_WinMessageBoxFunctio.html">Figure
"WinMessageBox() Function"</A>.
<P>
The result of the user's interaction with the message box (that is, the
identifier of the button that was pressed) is communicated to the application
in the form of an unsigned integer returned by the<B> WinMessageBox()</B> call.
 The application may then interrogate this returned value to determine the
subsequent action to be taken.
