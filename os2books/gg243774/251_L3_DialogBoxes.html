<H1>Dialog Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 270 -->
<P>
Communication between a standard window and a modeless dialog box is achieved
in a similar fashion to that used between two standard windows, since the
modeless dialog box is merely a normal window without a sizable border.
 However, communication between a standard window and a modal dialog box
must be achieved in a different manner, since a modal dialog box is typically
loaded and processed in a single<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function call, and the
dialog box only has an existence during the execution of that function call.
 An example of the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function is shown in <A HREF="032_L2_WinDlgBoxFunction.html">Figure
"WinDlgBox() Function"</A>.
<P>
Data may be passed to a dialog procedure at initialization time by creating
a data structure and passing a pointer to that structure in the<I> CreateParams
</I>field of the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function, as shown in <A HREF="032_L2_WinDlgBoxFunction.html">Figure
"WinDlgBox() Function"</A>.  This pointer is passed to the dialog procedure
as the second parameter of the WM_INITDLG message, and may be accessed by
the dialog procedure during the processing of this message.  Note that this
is the<I> only</I> time at which input may be passed to a dialog box, since
the dialog is processed within the scope of a single application statement;
either a<B> WinDlgBox()</B> call or a<B> WinProcessDlg()</B> call may be
used.  The WM_INITDLG message is described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0
Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
Information may be conveyed from a dialog procedure to its calling window
procedure in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The dialog box may provide an unsigned integer (USHORT)
parameter to the<B> WinDismissDlg()</B> function, and this value is passed
to the calling window procedure as the return code from the<B> WinDlgBox()
</B>function.  This technique is useful where an acknowledgement or simple
return data must  be conveyed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The dialog box may issue a<B> WinPostMsg()</B> call
to pass a message to the queue associated with its calling window. The window
procedure may then receive and process that message in the normal way.  This
technique is useful when more complex data or structures must be conveyed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The latter technique above may also be used to convey information to  a
window other than the window that invoked the dialog.  This may be necessary
in situations where a dialog box is invoked by one window procedure on behalf
of a group of windows.
