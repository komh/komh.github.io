<P>
Many definitions of the term<I> object-oriented programming</I> may be found
in various publications and presentations appearing over the last few years.
 These definitions often differ widely, and have resulted in a great deal
of confusion and debate as to the "true" meaning of the term. It may be
justifiably argued that there is no such true meaning, and the term<I> object-oriented
</I>may be used to describe techniques ranging from simple data abstraction
to the full inheritance hierarchies implemented by certain object-oriented
development tools.
