<H1>Adding Online Help and Documentation</H1><!-- entering slot 439 -->
<P>
In line with the philosophy of making applications easy to use through the
provision of an intuitive, graphical user interface, it is extremely useful
to have an application provide online, context-sensitive help and tutorial
facilities to the end user.  Such facilities further encourage learning
by exploration.
<P>
Presentation Manager provides such capabilities in the form of the <A HREF="594_L2_InformationPresentat.html"><B>Information
Presentation Facility</B> (<B>IPF</B>)</A>, which allows <A HREF="585_L2_helppanel.html"><B>help
panels</B></A> to be generated and displayed in <A HREF="586_L2_helpwindow.html"><B>help
windows</B></A> under Presentation Manager.  These help windows are linked
with the normal application windows in such a way that when the user presses
the "Help" key, selects a "Help" item from the menu bar or presses a "Help"
button in a dialog box, the appropriate help window is displayed.
<P>
In addition to providing online help for Presentation Manager applications,
IPF  can also be used in a stand-alone mode, to provide online documentation
for applications, or for business procedures that are independent of any
single application.  Using capabilities provided by IPF, an online procedure
manual may initiate appropriate applications, thus providing a "real-life"
tutorial capability for new or inexperienced users.
<P>
This chapter will describe the use of IPF for creating help libraries and
online documents, and examine some ways in which IPF  may improve the ease-of-use
of Presentation Manager applications.
