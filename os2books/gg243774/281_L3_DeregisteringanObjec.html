<H1>Deregistering an Object Class</H1><!-- entering slot 310 -->
<P>
An entire object class can be deleted from the system by deregistering it
from the Workplace Shell  This is achieved using the<B> WinDeregisterObjectClass()
</B>function, which is shown in <A HREF="065_L2_DeregisteringanObjec.html">Figure
"Deregistering an Object Class"</A>.
<P>
The<B> WinDeregisterObjectClass()</B> function accepts a string containing
the object class name.  Once a successful call is made to the<B> WinDeregisterObjectClass()
</B>function, the object class is deleted from the system and is no longer
available to other objects or applications. However, the DLL that contains
the code for the object class is not automatically deleted from the system;
if the<I> Templates</I> folder is subsequently opened with this DLL still
resident in a directory in the system's LIBPATH, a template for the class
will still appear in the folder. In order to prevent this, the DLL must
be explicitly deleted from the system.
<P>
During processing of the<B> WinDeregisterObjectClass()</B> call, the system
invokes the object's<I> _wpclsUnInitData</I> method, to free any instance
data or resources that were obtained when the object class was created.
 See <A HREF="278_L3_CreatinganObject.html">Creating an Object (Class Data)
</A>for an example of this method.
