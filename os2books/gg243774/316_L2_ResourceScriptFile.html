<P>
The resource script file is an ASCII text file in which Presentation Manager
resources are either defined or referenced.  A sample resource script file
is given in <A HREF="080_L2_ResourceScriptFile.html">Figure "Resource Script
File"</A>.
<P>
Note that the dialog templates are not defined directly in the resource
script file, but are incorporated at the end of the resource script file
using an<I> rcinclude</I> statement for the file<I> mydlg.dlg</I>. This
is the typical way to incorporate dialog templates that are created by the
Dialog Box Editor and stored in a DLG file.
<P>
The resource script file has a number of<I> #include</I> statements at the
start, similar to those typically found in C programs.  This is because
the symbolic names used throughout the resource script file represent integer
constants, and must be defined in the application's header file<I> myappl.h</I>.
Other symbolic names may be used in the .DLG file, and must also be defined;
 the header file<I> mydlg.h</I> for these symbolic names is generated by
the Dialog Box Editor.  Finally, a number of symbolic names such as DID_OK
and DID_CANCEL are actually defined by Presentation Manager rather than
by the application, and therefore the file<I> os2.h</I> is also required.

<P>
The resource script file is used as input to the resource compiler provided
as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.  For further
information on the resource compiler and its operation, see <A HREF="390_L2_ResourceCompilation.html">Resource
Compilation</A>.
