<H1>DosWaitThread() Function</H1><!-- entering slot 381 -->
<P>
Where a secondary thread must complete its processing<I> and  terminate
</I>before the primary thread can continue, the primary  thread may use
the<B> DosWaitThread()</B> function to determine whether the secondary thread
has terminated.  This function is used in conjunction with the Presentation
Manager timer facility, to periodically check whether the secondary thread
has issued a <B> DosExit()</B> function call.  An example of a secondary
thread  using this technique is given in <A HREF="102_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using the DosWaitThread() Function (Part 1)"</A>.
<P>
When the secondary thread has been started, the window procedure in the
primary thread stores the thread identifier in its instance data area (typically
using window words), and uses the Presentation Manager timer facility to
send periodic WM_TIMER messages to itself, as shown in <A HREF="103_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using the DosWaitThread() Function (Part 2)"</A>.
<P>
Whenever it receives a WM_TIMER message, the window procedure retrieves
the thread identifier from its instance data area and uses the<B> DosWaitThread()
</B>function to determine whether the thread has terminated.  If so, it
performs the required processing.  If the thread has not yet terminated,
it immediately returns control to Presentation Manager.  Note the use of
the<B> DosExit()</B> function in  <A HREF="102_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using the DosWaitThread() Function (Part 1)"</A>.  This
assumes that the processing  performed by the routine does not use an object
window, and does not  call C run-time library functions. As mentioned earlier
in this  chapter, secondary threads without object windows are typically
used to  perform a single, lengthy task, and terminate upon completion of
this  task.  Since they are able to use the<B> DosExit()</B> function and
 the completion of their task causes the termination of the thread, such
 threads are ideal candidates for use of the<B> DosWaitThread()</B>  function.
 For situations where the progress of execution must be  indicated to the
primary thread, an event semaphore is more suitable.
<P>
As already mentioned, there is very little difference between the  use of
the<B> DosWaitThread()</B> function and the use of an event  semaphore.
 Both are used in conjunction with the Presentation Manager timer facility
 and in fact, both use an event semaphore.  The <B> DosWaitThread()</B> function
avoids the need for the application  to explicitly open and check the semaphore,
since the<B> DosWaitThread()</B> function performs these operations  transparently.
However, while an event semaphore may be used to  indicate any significant
event during execution of a secondary thread,  while the<B> DosWaitThread()
</B>function can only signal  termination of the thread.  Hence the<B> DosWaitThread()
</B> function is slightly less flexible than the explicit use of an event
 semaphore with the Presentation Manager timer facility.
