<P>
Traditional functional decomposition techniques may then be used in the
design of the methods to complete the required actions.  If the high-level
design has been completed correctly, the application objects should be relatively
independent of one another. It should therefore be possible to complete
the development and testing of the methods for each object class as a separate
task with each class, its methods and valid interfaces defined and unit-tested
before the application is brought together for final integration-testing.
