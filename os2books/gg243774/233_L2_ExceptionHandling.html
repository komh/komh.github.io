<H1>Exception Handling</H1><!-- entering slot 250 -->
<P>
The following outcomes are possible when a memory object is referenced by
the application:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the memory has not been allocated or committed,
a general protection exception (Trap 000D) will occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the memory has been allocated but not committed,
a page fault exception (Trap 000E) will occur.
<P>
In both of the above cases, the exception is reported to the application's
general protection exception handler, if one has been registered by the
application.  The application may then deal with the error.  If an exception
handler has not been registered by the application, the default exception
handler provided by the operating system will terminate the application.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the page to be referenced has been defined as a
guard page, a guard page exception is generated.  If the application has
not registered its own handler for this exception, the system's default
handler will commit the page, and mark the next page in the memory object
as the new guard page for the object.  Once the guard page exception has
been processed, execution proceeds normally.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If none of the above conditions occur, the memory
object is accessed and execution proceeds normally.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Exception handlers for the various types of exception may be registered
using the<B> DosSetExceptionHandler()</B> function, as shown in <A HREF="021_L2_RegisteringaGuardPag.html">Figure
"Registering a Guard Page Exception Handler"</A>.
<P>
Note that unlike previous versions of OS/2, application handlers need not
be written in assembly language;  high-level programming languages may be
used.
<P>
Exception handlers are registered on a per-thread basis, and multiple exception
handlers may be registered for each thread.  When more than one exception
handler is registered, the handlers are chained, with the most recent addition
being placed at the start of the chain.  When an exception occurs, control
is passed to the first handler, which may handle the exception and return
XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION, in which case the operating system returns control
to the application.
<P>
If the exception handler cannot handle a particular exception, it returns
XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH, in which case the operating system passes control
to the next exception handler in the chain.  In this way, control is eventually
passed to the operating system's default exception handlers.
<P>
When an exception handler is no longer required, it can be removed from
the chain using the<B> DosUnsetExceptionHandler()</B> function.
<P>
Exception handling and the various operating system exceptions that can
occur are described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program Reference</I>.
