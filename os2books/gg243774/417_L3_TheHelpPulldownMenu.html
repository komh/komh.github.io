<H1>The Help Pulldown Menu</H1><!-- entering slot 459 -->
<P>
The menu bar of the main help window contains a "Help" pulldown menu which
in turn contains a number of options.  The resource definition for this
pulldown menu is included in the<I> hmtailor.rc</I> file provided with IPF,
and illustrated in <A HREF="135_L2_HelpPulldownMenuDefi.html">Figure "Help
Pulldown Menu Definition"</A>.
<P>
When the user selects an item from the help pulldown menu, a message is
generated, and is trapped by IPF and processed.  Typically, this message
causes IPF to query the application for the correct help panel.  The message
generated is dependent upon the pulldown menu item selected by the user.

<P>
<B>Help For Help</B>
<P>
When the user selects this item, IPF sends a WM_COMMAND message to the active
application window, with the first parameter containing the ID_HELP_FOR_HELP
identifier.  The application's window procedure should process this message
by sending an HM_REPLACE_HELP_FOR_HELP message containing the panel identifier
of its own "Help for help" panel if one exists, or by sending an HM_DISPLAY_PANEL
message with both parameters set to zero in order to display the default
panel.
<P>
<B>Extended Help</B>
<P>
When the user selects this item, IPF responds by displaying the "Extended
help" panel defined for the active application window in the help table.
 If no such help panel is defined for that window, IPF sends an HM_EXT_HELP_UNDEFINED
message to the application (see <A HREF="418_L3_CommunicationBetween.html">Communication
Between IPF and Applications (HM_EXT_HELP_UNDEFINED)</A>).
<P>
<B>Keys Help</B>
<P>
When the user selects this item, IPF sends an HM_QUERY_KEYS_HELP message
to the active application window.  The application's window procedure should
process this message by returning the panel identifier of its own "Keys
help" panel in the return code to Presentation Manager.
<P>
<B>Help Index</B>
<P>
Selecting this item causes IPF to display the index of the current help
library.
