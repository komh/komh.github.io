<H1>Dialog Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 486 -->
<P>
Standard dialog boxes to handle commonly performed user dialogs may also
be generated and placed in dynamic link libraries.  The inclusion of a dialog
box in a DLL however, is slightly more complicated than the inclusion of
a "normal" display or object window, due to the definition of the dialog
template as a Presentation Manager resource.  The DLL must therefore include
not only the dialog procedure and the invoking routine, but also the dialog
template definition.
<P>
This necessitates the invoking routine within the DLL not only executing
the<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function call, but also obtaining a module handle
for the DLL and an entry point address for the dialog procedure.  The necessary
steps are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The dialog procedure and the invoking routine
are developed and placed in a dynamic link library.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The invoking routine is declared as an exportable
entry point and may thus be called by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The dialog template is created using the Dialog
Box Editor, resource compiled and combined with the DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The invoking routine for a dialog box loaded from a DLL is described, along
with an example, in <A HREF="082_L2_LoadingaDialogResour.html">Figure "Loading
a Dialog Resource From a DLL"</A>.
