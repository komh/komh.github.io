<P>
The definition and use of Presentation Manager resources by applications
was mentioned in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The Presentation
Manager Application Model</A>.  The use of such resources greatly simplifies
the task of the application developer in creating windows, menu bars, etc.,
and provides a powerful tool for the externalization of the user interface
properties of an application object, thereby enabling easier modification
of these properties during development or maintenance of the application.
 This chapter will describe the definition of resources, and the ways in
which resources may be used within a Presentation Manager application.
