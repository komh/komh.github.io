<H1>Terminating a Process</H1><!-- entering slot 366 -->
<P>
A process may terminate another process running in the system, provided
it has access to the process ID of the process it wishes to terminate.  This
process ID is returned by the<B> DosExecPgm()</B> function when the process
is created and since, in the majority of  cases, a process is terminated
by the process that created it, this  presents no particular problem since
the process ID can be stored as a  global variable or as instance data in
window words, until it is needed  to terminate the process.
<P>
A process is terminated using the<B> DosKillProcess()</B>  function.  This
function may be used to terminate a single process, or  to terminate a process
and all its descendants (that is, its children,  along with their children,
and so on).  An example of the <B> DosKillProcess()</B> function is given
in <A HREF="089_L2_TerminatingaProcess.html">Figure "Terminating a Process"</A>.

<P>
The value of "1" specified for the first parameter in the <B> DosKillProcess()
</B>call causes the function to terminate only  the specified process and
not its descendants (if any).
