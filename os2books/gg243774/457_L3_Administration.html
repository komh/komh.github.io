<P>
As in any multi-user environment, some degree of system administration is
necessary in a LAN environment.  When a LAN is used to provide a workstation
application development platform, the LAN administrator must perform the
following duties:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->At the outset of development for a particular application,
create a network domain for that development project.  This is optional,
and it may be considered expedient to combine a number of smaller projects
into a single network domain.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Create the production libraries for the project's
network domain.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Register each developer as a user of the project's
network domain, and define each developer to have read-only access to production
libraries.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provide the appointed owner of each application resource
with write access to the resource or resources under his/her jurisdiction.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->In the case where an application resource has been
checked out and remains checked out for an unnecessary length of time (for
example, a developer checks out a resource and then goes on vacation without
first submitting the new version for promotion), provide an override capability
to cancel the checkout.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
It is recommended that the LAN administrator be the same person responsible
for administration of the production libraries that contain system software
such as compilers and link-editors, in order to place all such system administration
responsibilities with the same person.
