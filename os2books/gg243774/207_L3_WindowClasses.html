<H1>Window Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 219 -->
<P>
Since many windows may be in existence at any time, windows having similar
properties and behavior are grouped into <A HREF="710_L2_windowclass.html"><B>window
classes</B></A>, with each window belonging to a class being an <A HREF="598_L2_instance.html"><B>instance
</B></A>of that class. Window classes may be public (defined by Presentation
Manager and usable by all applications in the system) or private (defined
by the application and accessible only by that application unless an application
developer decides otherwise; see <A HREF="220_L2_CreatingReusableCode.html">Creating
Reusable Code</A>).  Private window classes are registered to Presentation
Manager by the application upon initialization of the application.
<P>
Presentation Manager maintains control information relating to each window
created in the system, including properties such as window text, current
size and location, etc.  In addition to this information, an application
may specify an additional area of storage to be included within the window
control block for application data relating to that window.  This storage
is known as <A HREF="713_L2_windowwords.html"><B>window words</B></A>. The
presence and size of window words is determined for each window class at
the time the class is registered to Presentation Manager.  However, a new
storage area is defined for<I> each</I> instance of the class, and window
words may therefore be used for instance data. Window words typically contain
pointers to dynamically-defined application data structures, which in turn
contain the instance data.
