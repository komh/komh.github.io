<H1>Dynamic Linking</H1><!-- entering slot 194 -->
<P>
OS/2 system services are requested by application programs using function
calls; the external code references generated by such calls are resolved
when the program is loaded or when the segments of the program are loaded,
rather than at link-edit time.  This deferred resolution of external references
is known as <A HREF="557_L2_dynamiclinking.html"><B>dynamic linking</B></A>,
and is available to applications, which may incorporate their own routines
into <A HREF="558_L2_dynamiclinklibrary.html"><B>dynamic link libraries
</B>(<B>DLLs</B>)</A>.
<P>
Dynamic linking may be achieved in two ways under OS/2;<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="608_L2_loadtimedynamiclinki.html"><B>Load-time
dynamic linking</B></A> resolves external references within a code segment
at the time the segment is loaded into memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="671_L2_runtimedynamiclinkin.html"><B>Run-time
dynamic linking</B></A> postpones the resolution until the actual execution
of the code, at which time the appropriate module is explicitly loaded and
invoked by the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Load-time dynamic linking is the simplest mechanism;  as already mentioned,
OS/2 system services are implemented in this way.  Load-time dynamic linking
is used whenever an application developer wishes to provide common services
that may be used by multiple applications, and which are implemented independently
of the applications that will use them.  Run-time dynamic linking is used
where particular routines may or may not be used by an application, and
thus should not be loaded into memory unless required. If an application
requires that such a routine be executed, the application may then explicitly
load the routine and execute it.
<P>
Dynamic linking provides an architected method of extending the services
of the operating system; all of the application programming interfaces supported
by OS/2 are implemented using dynamically linked modules.  An application
developer may use the same facilities to create his or her own dynamically
linked modules to provide additional services or standard routines that
may be used by applications executing in the system.
<P>
Dynamic linking is of benefit in that routines contained in DLLs are completely
independent of application code, and may be modified without the need to
re-link applications. In this way, DLLs contribute to the containment of
change within applications.  In addition, the contents of DLLs are not limited
to application code.  Presentation Manager <A HREF="667_L2_resource.html"><B>resources
</B></A>such as icons, bitmaps, graphics fonts, window definitions etc,
may be generated and stored in a DLL for subsequent use by applications.
 See <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager Resources
</A>for a further discussion of Presentation Manager resources.  DLLs thus
provide a powerful mechanism for the creation of reusable modules for both
full-screen and Presentation Manager applications.
<P>
Secondly, the creation of DLLs as re-entrant routines reduces the storage
requirements for OS/2 applications, since multiple applications may make
use of the same memory-resident copy of a DLL.  This re-entrancy and reusability,
in conjunction with the code independence gained by using a DLL, makes the
DLL a useful vehicle for implementation of standard service routines, which
may be accessed by any application or process within the system.  This contributes
to standardization within the business organization, which in turn can result
in improved productivity and reduced maintenance effort since the code to
implement a particular function need reside in only one location.
<P>
Note that a DLL is<I> not</I> a process under OS/2.  The re-entrant nature
of a DLL allows multiple applications to use the same memory-resident copy
of the code; however, each instance executes under the control of the process
that invoked it.
