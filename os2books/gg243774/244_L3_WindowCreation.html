<H1>Window Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 262 -->
<P>
A window is created by Presentation Manager in response to the application
issuing  a<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B> function call or a<B> WinCreateWindow()
</B>call; an example of the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> call is given in <A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure
"Sample Application Main Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A>.
<P>
The first statement in the example specifies the attributes of the frame
window, which are contained in the data variable<I> fcdata.flCreateFlags</I>.
These values determine the control windows that are created with the frame
window (FCF_SYSMENU, FCF_MINMAX etc), and also indicate to Presentation
Manager that it should select the position of the window on the desktop
(FCF_SHELLPOSITION).
<P>
The window is then created in two steps; firstly the frame window is created,
with the desktop as its parent, and then the client window is created with
the frame window as its parent.  The frame window belongs to the system-defined
window class WC_FRAME, whereas the client window belongs to an application-defined
window class WCP_MAIN, which is assumed to have already been defined to
Presentation Manager using a<B> WinRegisterClass()</B> call.
<P>
If it is necessary to pass initialization information to a window upon its
creation, this may be achieved using the<I> CtlData</I> parameter in the
<B>WinCreateWindow()</B> function.  This parameter is a 32-bit pointer,
which may reference an application-defined data  structure.  This pointer
is passed to the window as the first parameter of the WM_CREATE message.
 The window may, during its processing of this message, extract the pointer
from the message parameter and use it to access the data structure.  See
<A HREF="025_L2_SampleApplicationMai.html">Figure "Sample Application Main
Routine (Part 2) - Window Creation"</A> for an  example of this technique.

<P>
When an application requests that Presentation Manager creates a window
of a particular class, a message of the system-defined class WM_CREATE is
sent to the window procedure associated with that class.  The window procedure
may capture this message by including a case for it, and perform any processing
such as opening files or databases, allocating memory objects and setting
instance data to initial default values.
<P>
In coding the method for this message class, the first statement should
be a call to<B> WinDefWindowProc()</B>, which will enable Presentation Manager
to perform default processing and complete the initialization of  the window
(such as allocating a window handle) before the application-specific processing
is carried out.  If the default processing is not completed first, the window
handle and any window words may not be allocated before the application
makes function calls that reference them, thus causing these calls to fail.

<P>
Where instance data or resource handles will be used by the window, and
must be maintained beyond the processing of a single message, a data structure
should be defined to contain these items.  Memory for the data structure
should be requested from the operating system, and a  pointer to the memory
object stored in the window words, as part of the  WM_CREATE processing.
 See <A HREF="247_L3_InstanceDataandWindo.html">Instance Data and Window
Words</A> for further information.
