<H1>Data Abstraction and Encapsulation</H1><!-- entering slot 515 -->
<P>
In order to enhance reusability and to facilitate the containment (and therefore
the management) of change, data definition and initialization should, wherever
possible, be encapsulated within source modules as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Local variables should be used wherever possible.
 Where the value of a variable must be held between invocations of the same
function or subroutine, the<I> static</I> keyword may be used in declaring
the variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->For window procedures where the values of variables
must be held beyond the scope of processing a single message, a memory object
may be allocated for the variable(s) and a pointer to that object stored
in the window words of the window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->External data objects such as files, databases, etc.,
should be defined and accessed only from within a single window procedure
and its dependent functions and subroutines.  Definition of and/or establishment
of access to such data objects should be performed upon window creation
as part of the WM_CREATE message processing, and termination of access should
be performed upon window closure as part of the WM_CLOSE message processing.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The use of global variables should be avoided wherever
possible, although it is recognized that global variables are necessary
in certain circumstances within a Presentation Manager application.  Where
global variables are to be used, they should be declared in the application's
main source module (that is, the module that contains the application's
main routine) and referenced from the application's global header file using
the<I> extern</I> keyword.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Except in the case noted above, the use of external
variable declarations using the<I> extern</I> keyword should be avoided
wherever possible, since this creates an interdependence between source
modules (and therefore between application objects) that may subsequently
limit the potential for reuse of those objects.  Variables should preferably
be defined locally within a source module or alternatively, defined globally
and referenced in the application's global header file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where non-local variables and/or constants (that is,
variables and/or constants that are accessed only from within a particular
source module, but are not local to any routine within that module) are
declared, they should be placed in that source module's private header file
or, if the module does not possess its own header file, placed at the beginning
of the source module.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The practice of maximizing the use of local and encapsulated data, and of
minimizing and simplifying the external interfaces of application objects,
will achieve the maximum level of isolation and therefore of independence
between application objects, thus enhancing the potential for their reuse
and facilitating their future maintenance by isolating their internal workings
from those of other application objects.
