<H1>Message Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 223 -->
<P>
In order to allow any window the ability to process any message class, Presentation
Manager defines a standard format for messages.  In the Presentation Manager
environment, a message is composed of four distinct attributes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<B> window handle</B> identifying the window for
which the message is intended<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<B> message ID</B> identifying the particular class
of message<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Two<B> message parameters</B>, which are 32-bit fields
containing a variety of information, depending upon the class of message
received.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
All Presentation Manager applications must contain a message processing
loop, which receives the message from Presentation Manager (see <A HREF="213_L2_ApplicationStructure.html">Application
Structure</A>), and routes it, using Presentation Manager message-dispatching
functions, to the appropriate window procedure for processing.  Thus Presentation
Manager actually invokes the window procedure on the application's behalf.

<P>
<B>Message Identifier</B>
<P>
The message ID identifies the message class to which each message belongs,
and is in fact an integer value which is typically replaced by a symbolic
name for ease of use.  The symbolic names for all system-defined message
classes are defined by Presentation Manager; symbolic names for application-defined
(private) message classes must be declared by the application developer
in the application's source code.  This is typically achieved by declaring
an integer constant, the value of which is specified as an offset from the
system-defined value WM_USER.  For example:
<PRE>#define WMP_MYMESSAGE     WM_USER+6
</PRE>

<P>
The use of an offset to a system-defined constant, rather than an absolute
numeric value, eliminates the chance of using the same integer value as
a system-defined message class (with consequently unpredictable results),
and avoids the necessity to alter application code should the number or
definition of system-defined message classes be altered in future versions
of Presentation Manager.
<P>
<B>Message Parameters</B>
<P>
As noted above, message parameters may contain a variety of information.
 When used for communication between window procedures, the window handle
of the calling window may be passed to the destination window as one of
the message parameters, in order that the destination window procedure may
dispatch an acknowledgement or reply message to the calling window.  Qualifiers
to the message type or small items of data may also be passed; for example,
the Presentation Manager-defined WM_COMMAND message class (indicating a
menu selection by the user) uses the first message parameter to identify
the menu item selected.
<P>
When large data structures are required to be passed between window procedures,
and the data obviously cannot be contained within the two 32-bit message
parameters, the convention is to allocate a memory object for the required
data structure using the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function, and to pass a pointer
to that memory object as a parameter to the message.  Presentation Manager
provides a number of macros to enable various types of data to be placed
into and retrieved from message parameters.  The insertion and retrieval
of data into and from message parameters is described in <A HREF="255_L3_CreatingMessageParam.html">Creating
Message Parameters</A>.
