<P>
A secondary thread with an object window should be terminated by the window
procedure in the primary thread that initially created the secondary thread.
 This is achieved simply by posting a WM_QUIT message to the object window,
which will cause the message processing loop for the secondary thread to
terminate.
<P>
The thread's main routine then issues<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> calls for
its object windows.  These calls cause WM_DESTROY messages to be posted
to the object windows, which will process these messages in order to close
data objects, release any resources, etc., in accordance with established
conventions.
<P>
Once all data objects and other resources have been released or destroyed,
the thread should terminate itself using the<B> _endthread()</B> function.
The use of this function will ensure that the semaphores and control structures
used by the<B> _beginthread()</B> function are correctly  reset.
