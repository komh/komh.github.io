<H1>Link Edit</H1><!-- entering slot 431 -->
<P>
When using the IBM C Set/2 compiler, an application may be compiled and
link-edited in a single operation.  The following command sequence is used
to compile and link edit a program for Presentation Manager under OS/2 Version
2.0:
<PRE>CC /L- /G3 /Ti+ /Gm+ MYPROG OS2386.LIB MYPROG.DEF
</PRE>

<P>
This command sequence directs the linkage editor to compile the file MYPROG.C
to produce an object file named MYPROG.OBJ, and to link this file to produce
an executable file named MYPROG.EXE, without creating a list file, to use
the run-time library named OS2386.LIB and the module definition file named
MYPROG.DEF.
<P>
Note the use of the<B> /Gm+</B> option.  This option causes the multithreading
"C" run-time libraries to be used in linking, thereby enabling multithreadingin
the resulting application code.
