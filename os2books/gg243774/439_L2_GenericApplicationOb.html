<H1>Generic Application Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 482 -->
<P>
Within the Presentation Manager application model, a window procedure provides
both the definition of a data object and the methods that operate upon that
data object.  A window procedure may therefore be considered as a complete
application object in its own right.
<P>
Where the data object to be manipulated by a window will be accessed by
a number of applications, it makes sense to define the data object and its
methods once, in a single window procedure, and to make that window procedure
available to any application that needs to manipulate the data object.  Any
changes to the data object's characteristics or processing requirements
can then be contained within the application object, avoiding the need to
modify and recompile multiple applications.  The dynamic linking capabilities
of OS/2 facilitate such a technique, enabling such modifications to be automatically
incorporated into applications at load time or run time.
