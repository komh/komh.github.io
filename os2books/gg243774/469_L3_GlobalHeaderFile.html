<P>
An application may contain a global header file, which itself should contain:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Declarations for all global constants used by the
application; that is, those constants that are accessed from more than one
source module within the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Declarations for all global variables used by the
application; that is, those variables that are accessed from more than one
source module within the application.  Note that this does not include those
variables that are used by multiple routines within the same source module.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The global header file should be referenced, using an appropriate<I> #include
</I>statement, by all source modules within the application, other than
the module(s) containing generic routines.
