<H1>Object-Oriented Design</H1><!-- entering slot 204 -->
<P>
The success of object-oriented design lies in the correct and intelligent
definition of application objects and their methods as coherent and independent
units.  The secret of a successful approach to this task is the consideration
of the data objects themselves as the focus, rather than the procedures
that will operate upon these objects.  Since the objects are typically associated
with data, an entity-relationship model is often a useful starting point.

<P>
Correctly-designed application objects facilitate reusability, since the
data object and applicable actions are all defined within the application
object.  Additional applications that require manipulation of that data
object may use the existing application object to achieve the required actions.
 Certain applications may require additional, unforeseen actions, or that
existing actions be carried out in a different manner; in such cases, subclassing
the application object allows such modifications to be carried out.  One
of the aims in the high-level design of an object-oriented application should
be to make maximum use of existing application objects where possible, in
order to reduce the design, coding and testing effort required.  This not
only reduces the time and expense involved in application development, but
enables application solutions to be delivered in a shorter time frame, allowing
the business enterprise to respond more quickly to a dynamic marketplace.

<P>
The correct definition of application objects and their boundaries also
facilitates change management and maintenance of application code, since
changes to a particular data object should affect only the application object(s)
dealing with that data object.  Thus the effects of change are ideally confined
to a single application object.  Modifications to a method within an application
object should not affect the workings of other objects with which that application
object interacts, provided the external interfaces of that object are not
altered by the modification.  This containment of change within a single
application object has the potential, in conjunction with proper configuration
management techniques, to greatly ease the effort and cost involved in application
maintenance.
<P>
The following steps are necessary in the design of an object-oriented application:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Identify the data objects (that is, the different
representations of the logical data entity or entities upon which the application
is to operate) and the relationships between data objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Determine the set of applicable actions to be
performed on each data object.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Determine whether application objects have been
previously been created for the data objects to be manipulated by the application,
and to what extent these existing objects perform the required set of actions
for each object.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Determine the message classes required to achieve
the desired communication and to initiate required actions that are not
already satisfied through existing application objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Design the methods necessary to carry out the
additional actions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
These steps are generic in nature, and must be combined with suitable management
controls, checkpoints and documentation standards to ensure adequate design
quality at each stage in the process.
