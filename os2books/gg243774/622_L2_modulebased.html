module-based
<P>
Term used to describe an implementation of object-oriented programming,
whereby an object class is completely defined in its own right, and does
not depend upon the definitions of other classes. Such an approach provides
increased levels of granularity and thus enhances object reusability, albeit
at the expense of additional complexity during creation of the object.  Compare
with <A HREF="519_L2_classbased.html">class-based</A> approach.
