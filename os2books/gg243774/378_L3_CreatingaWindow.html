<H1>Creating a Window</H1><!-- entering slot 420 -->
<P>
When a 32-bit application module creates a window, and the window procedure
for that window resides in a 16-bit module (either statically linked or
in a DLL), the calling routine must explicitly declare the 16-bit nature
of the window procedure's entry point when registering the window class.
 This may become rather complex, since it involves invoking a 32-bit entry
point from a 32-bit module, but passing a 16-bit entry point as a parameter.

<P>
A simpler solution is to build a registration routine within the 16-bit
module, which registers the window class and creates the window.  The 32-bit
module then need only invoke this routine, and allow for the resulting 16-bit
window handle.  This technique has the added advantage that Presentation
Manager records the fact that the window was registered from a 16-bit module,
and will automatically perform thunking for system-defined message classes.
 The technique is illustrated in <A HREF="114_L2_Creatinga16bitWindow.html">Figure
"Creating a 16-bit Window From Within a 32-bit Module"</A>.
<P>
Since the 16-bit module would typically be a DLL, the registration routine
is declared in the 16-bit module as an exportable entry point using the
EXPENTRY keyword.
<P>
The 32-bit module declares the registration routine<I> MakeMyWindow()</I> as
a 16-bit function using the<I> #pragma linkage</I> directive with the<I> far16
</I>keyword. Since in 16-bit code, the EXPENTRY keyword forces use of the
<I>pascal</I> calling convention, the directive also specifies this calling
convention.  Note that if the registration routine and the window procedure
were to reside in a DLL, this declaration would typically take place within
a header file provided by the developer of the DLL.
<P>
The 32-bit module invokes the registration routine that registers the window
class and creates the window.  The registration routine then returns the
window handle to the 32-bit module, which stores it in 16:16 format. Note
that the registration routine in the 16-bit module is not aware that it
is being called from a 32-bit module.
<P>
This approach allows the same DLL to be accessed by both 16-bit and 32-bit
applications concurrently.  The developer of the DLL simply provides two
separate header files containing declarations of the DLL's entry points,
in the appropriate format for each programming environment.
