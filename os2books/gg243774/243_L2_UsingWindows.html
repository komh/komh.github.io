<P>
As mentioned in <A HREF="215_L3_WindowProcedures.html">Window Procedures</A>,
window procedures within a Presentation Manager application are reentrant;
that is, the same window procedure is used for multiple instances of the
same window class.  However, a window class may have separate data objects
associated with each instance of that class, which may be used to store
temporary data necessary during the existence of that object;  such data
is known as instance data.  These data objects may need to be  created/opened
and initialized.  Upon the window being closed, data  objects may need to
be closed or destroyed in a controlled fashion.
<P>
Presentation Manager allows such function to be performed by a window procedure,
since messages are sent to a window by Presentation Manager informing the
window procedure of events such as creation or closure of the window.  These
messages are discussed below.
