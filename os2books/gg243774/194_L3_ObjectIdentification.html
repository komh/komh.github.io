<P>
The identification of data objects and their relationships should begin
with the definition of a normal entity-relationship model, and the extension
of this model to reflect the representations of data objects as well as
the logical data entities involved.  The objective should be to achieve
an optimal balance between the number of object classes and the size and
complexity of each class, since each object may itself be composed of other
objects, also bearing in mind that multiple objects of the same class may
exist.  Optimizing the number of object classes will allow the number of
message classes to be minimized, which in turn simplifies the design of
the methods and the eventual testing of the object classes.
