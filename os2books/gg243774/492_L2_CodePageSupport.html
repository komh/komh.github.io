<H1>Code Page Support</H1><!-- entering slot 535 -->
<P>
Code page support has been simplified under OS/2 Version 2.0, and a number
of function names have been changed to conform to the consistent naming
rules introduced in Version 2.0.
<P>
<A HREF="159_L2_CodePageFunctions.html">Table "Code Page Functions"</A>
<P>
The<B> DosSetCp()</B> function is no longer implemented, since under OS/2
Version 2.0 an application may only set the code page for its own process,
using the<B> DosSetProcessCp()</B> function.
<P>
The<B> DosCaseMap()</B> function is no longer implemented since the same
task is performed by the<B> WinUpper()</B> function.
