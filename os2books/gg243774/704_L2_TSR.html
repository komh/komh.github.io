TSR

Terminate-and-Stay-Resident; term used to describe a DOS application that
modifies an operating system interrupt vector to point to its own location
(known as hooking an interrupt).  This process is not permitted under OS/2,
although facilities exist under OS/2 to provide the same capability for
applications.
