<H1>Resources and National Language Support</H1><!-- entering slot 354 -->
<P>
Since Presentation Manager resources provide the ability to define all the
user interface properties of a Presentation Manager application, externally
to the application code, they provide a useful means for implementing national
language support within Presentation Manager applications.  Resources may
be used to define:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Window titles<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Menu bar and pulldown menu entries, including mnemonics
and accelerator keys<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Dialogs<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Messages<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Symbols such as icons and pointers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
In short, all of the language-specific properties of an application may
be defined using Presentation Manager resources.  Icons and other graphical
symbols used by the user interface may also be tailored to suit different
cultures where such symbols may have different meanings.
<P>
The set of resources for each national language may be compiled and incorporated
into a separate dynamic link library, which may be accessed by the application
in order to load the required resources, as described in <A HREF="320_L3_LoadingDialogsFromaD.html">Loading
Dialogs From a DLL</A>.  The resource identifiers must, of course, be identical
in each DLL.  Upon installation of the application on a workstation, an
installation procedure can prompt the user to determine the required language,
and install the appropriate DLL for that language.
<P>
Where multiple languages must be supported in the same system, an application
may query the codepage currently in use by its parent process using the
<B>WinQueryCp()</B> function, and load resources from a specific DLL, depending
upon the result of the function call.  While this method is by no means
foolproof, it will suffice for many languages that use a single national
codepage and single-byte characters.
