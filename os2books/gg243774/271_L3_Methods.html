<H1>Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 291 -->
<P>
In a Presentation Manager application, a window procedure receives messages
from Presentation Manager, determines the type of message and invokes a
series of program statements (which effectively constitute a method) as
a result of that message.  A Workplace Shell object operates in a similar
fashion, except that the Workplace Shell itself determines the type of message
and invokes the corresponding method, without any explicit action on the
part of the object.
<P>
Therefore, whereas the Presentation Manager window procedure comprises a
<I>case</I> statement with each case being a method, the Workplace Shell
object eliminates the need for the<I> case</I> statement and allows the
Workplace Shell to invoke the methods directly.  The syntax for invoking
a method from within an object or application is hence very similar to that
for invoking a subroutine;  the only real difference is that a method may
be accessed from outside the object itself (that is, from another object
or from an application), while a subroutine is normally private to the object.

<P>
Many methods are defined by the<I> WPObject</I> class, from which application-defined
classes are typically descended.  When creating a new object class, a programmer
may override the methods already defined by the class's ancestors, and/or
include new methods specific to the class being created.  The methods defined
by the<I> WPObject</I> class are described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0
Presentation Manager Reference</I>.  Programmers who wish to create new
object classes descended from this case should read the descriptions of
these methods to determine the extent of the modifications necessary.
<P>
<B>Invoking a Method</B>
<P>
As mentioned in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The Presentation
Manager Application Model</A>, methods within an object are invoked as a
result of messages that communicate events to the object.  These events
may be initiated by the user (for example, as a result of clicking the mouse
on an object's context menu), by the object itself or another object, or
by the system to indicate a system event such as opening or closing a view
of the object.
<P>
The syntax for invoking a method is similar to that for invoking a subroutine,
with the exception that since a method is invoked by the Workplace Shell,
the first parameter passed in the call is therefore not a parameter used
by the method, but a pointer to an object that is capable of invoking the
method; this is typically a pointer to the object itself.  This is illustrated
in <A HREF="044_L2_InvokingaMethod.html">Figure "Invoking a Method"</A>,
where a sample invocation of a method named<I> _wpSetTitle</I> is shown.

<P>
The<I> _wpSetTitle</I> method is defined by the<I> WPObject</I> class, and
is inherited by all classes descended from the class.  The method accepts
a title string and sets the title of the object; that is, the text that
appears below the object's icon on the Workplace Shell desktop.
<P>
The pointer<I> somSelf</I> is defined by the SOM Precompiler when it creates
the "C" source code from the class definition file.  In the example above,
<I>somSelf</I> is defined as a pointer to an object of class<I> PWFolder
</I>and within a method, allows the method to access the instance data of
the object to which it belongs.  The need to pass this pointer arises from
the limitations of the "C" language syntax under which the current implementation
of the Workplace Shell operates; other languages such as C++ may be able
to invoke methods in a more elegant manner.
<P>
<B>Method Processing and Instance Data</B>
<P>
Within a method, the<I> somSelf</I> pointer, passed as the first parameter
in the call to the method, acts as a pointer to the method's own object,
and allows the method to access its instance data.  The SOM Precompiler
automatically provides a base pointer named<I> somThis</I> that references
the instance data, and includes a call to a method that initializes this
pointer from the object pointer:
<PRE>PWFolderData *somThis = PWFolderGetData(somSelf);
</PRE>

<P>
When this statement has successfully executed upon entry to the method,
the method has access to the object's instance data.  For example, the password-<!-- entering slot 292 -->protectedfolderhasapasswordstring
,whichmaybeaccessedbyamethodusingthefollowingname :
<PRE>somThis-&gt;szPassword
</PRE>

<P>
To make things simpler, the SOM Precompiler generates a macro for each instance
variable, in a manner similar to that used for function names:
<PRE>   #define _szPassword (somThis-&gt;szPassword)
   #define _szCurrentPassword (somThis-&gt;szCurrentPassword)
   #define _szUserid (somThis-&gt;szUserid)
</PRE>

<P>
This macro is included in a header file for the object class, and avoids
the need for the programmer to type the complete name throughout the source
code.
<P>
Once the instance data is available to the method, any application logic
may be performed, including the use of OS/2 and Presentation Manager resources.
 See <A HREF="282_L3_AccessingPresentatio.html">Accessing Presentation Manager
Resources From a Workplace Shell Object</A> for additional considerations
on the use of Presentation Manag er resources from within a Workplace Shell
object.
<P>
<B>Returning from a Method</B>
<P>
In order to return control to its calling routine, a method simply uses
the<I> return</I> statement.  Any valid form of return code may be passed
to the calling routine as a parameter to this statement, provided that the
data type of the return code is consistent with the declaration of the method.
The data type of the return code is typically set by the SOM Precompiler,
and a default<I> return</I> statement provided, based on information supplied
by the programmer when the method is defined in the<I> Methods</I> section
of the class definition file (see <A HREF="275_L3_ClassDefinitionFile.html">Class
Definition File</A>).
<P>
<B>Overriding Existing Methods</B>
<P>
A new object class may override one or more of the existing methods defined
by its parent class, either to completely replace the processing performed
by these methods, or to add its own processing to that already performed
by the parent.  An example of an object class overriding the<I> _wpSetTitle
</I>method is shown in <A HREF="045_L2_OverridinganExisting.html">Figure
"Overriding an Existing Method"</A>.
<P>
The example given in <A HREF="045_L2_OverridinganExisting.html">Figure "Overriding
an Existing Method"</A> shows the use of class-specific processing to modify
the title of a password-protected folder.  The inclusion of the string "&lt;LOCKED&gt;"
at the end of the user-specified title provides a visual indication to the
user that the folder is locked.  Additional visual indication is provided
by modifying the icon when the folder is in the locked state; the code that
carries out this operation is included in the<I> _LockFolder</I> method
shown in <A HREF="046_L2_AddingaNewMethod.html">Figure "Adding a New Method"</A>.

<P>
The strings<I> _szCurrentPassword</I> and<I> _szPassword</I> are instance
data items defined by the new object class.  These data items are actually
accessed using the<I> somThis</I> pointer; however, the SOM Precompiler
defines a macro for each instance data item, as described in Method Processing
and Instance Data above.
<P>
Note that the default processing supplied by the parent class is invoked
at the end of the class-specific processing.  For all but the most exceptional
circumstances, default processing should be allowed to occur in order to
ensure that the normal behavior of the object class is preserved.
<P>
<B>Adding New Methods</B>
<P>
In addition to overriding existing methods defined by the parent class,
an object class may also add new methods to carry out processing for events
not handled by the parent class.  For example, the password-protected folder
example must have a mechanism to lock the folder.  This is implemented as
a new method named<I> _LockFolder</I>, as shown in <A HREF="046_L2_AddingaNewMethod.html">Figure
"Adding a New Method"</A>.
<P>
This method simply copies a default string to the variable<I> _szCurrentPassword
</I>that contains the last supplied password entry from the user, so that
when a comparison is made between this variable and the folder's password,
the two do not match.  This<!-- entering slot 293 --> effectively locks
the folder and prevents any view of it being opened.  To provide a visual
indication to the end user that the folder is locked, a "locked" icon is
loaded using the Presentation Manager<B> WinLoadPointer()</B> function,
and the<I> _wpSetIcon</I> method is invoked to set this as the folder's
new icon on the desktop.
<P>
Note that the definition for adding a new method is very similar to that
for overriding an existing method.  The primary difference is that, since
the new method is specific to the object class and is not defined by the
parent class, there is no need to invoke the parent class's method to perform
default processing for the method.
<P>
<B>Attaching a Method to the Context Menu</B>
<P>
A method may be invoked as a result of the user selecting an item from the
object's context menu.  In order to allow this, an item must be added to
the context menu, and an appropriate action must be taken by the object
when that item is selected by the user.
<P>
An item can be added to the context menu for an object class by overriding
the<I> _wpModifyPopupMenu</I> method defined by the<I> WPObject</I> class,
and including a call to the<I> _wpInsertPopupMenuItems</I> method to insert
the item.  This technique is shown in <A HREF="047_L2_AddinganItemtoaConte.html">Figure
"Adding an Item to a Context Menu"</A>.
<P>
The example shown in <A HREF="047_L2_AddinganItemtoaConte.html">Figure "Adding
an Item to a Context Menu"</A> adds a<I> Lock</I> item to the context menu
for the password-protected folder object.  This allows the folder to be
locked by the user at any time, irrespective of whether a view of the folder
is currently open.
<P>
The<I> _wpInsertPopupMenuItems</I> method adds a menu item or a submenu
to the existing context menu for the object.  The item identifier for the
menu item or submenu (MI_LOCK in the above example) is an integer constant
that is typically defined in the header file.  Note that the value of this
constant should be specified as an offset from the system-defined constant
WPMENUID_USER, rather than an absolute integer value.  Following this convention
will avoid any clashes with item identifiers defined by the Workplace Shell
for default context menu items.
<P>
Since the password-protected folder is a descendant of the<I> WPFolder</I> class
defined by the Workplace Shell, the default context menu items for the<I> WPFolder
</I>class should also appear.  The default processing for the parent class
is therefore invoked as part of the<I> _wpModifyPopupMenu</I> processing
for the new object class.
<P>
Once the required item is added to the context menu, the object must be
able to detect when the item is selected in order to invoke the appropriate
method.  By default, the<I> _wpMenuItemSelected</I> method is invoked by
the system whenever the user selects an item from the context menu.  This
method, which is defined by the<I> WPObject</I> class, may be overridden
by a new object class in order to check for the presence of a new item and
invoke the appropriate method.  The item identifier of the selected item
is passed as a parameter to the<I> _wpMenuItemSelected</I> method, and is
normally interrogated using a<I> case</I> statement, as shown in <A HREF="048_L2_InvokingaMethodviaaC.html">Figure
"Invoking a Method via a Context Menu Item"</A>.
<P>
The<I> _wpMenuItemSelected</I> method consists of a<I> case</I> statement
that determines the item selected from the context menu.  In the above example,
an explicit case is included only for the MI_LOCK item defined by this class.
 All other menu items are defined by the parent class, and their selection
is therefore handled by allowing the parent class's default processing to
occur.
<P>
<B>Class Methods</B>
<P>
Most object methods are instance methods; that is, they act upon one particular
instance of an object class, rather than upon all instances of the class.

<P>
However, there are times when it is useful to have methods that operate
on the object class itself.  These methods may operate on class data rather
than instance data, thereby affecting the entire class rather than a single
instance of the class.  Such methods are known as class methods.  The class
method<I> _wpclsQueryTitle</I> is defined by the<I> WPObject</I> class,
and is overridden in the password-protected folder example.  An example
of the overridden<I> _wpclsQueryTitle</I> method is given in <A HREF="049_L2_ClassMethodExample.html">Figure
"Class Method Example"</A>.
<P>
The purpose of this class method is to provide the password-protected folder
with a default title.  This is the title that will appear with the folder's
template icon in the<I> Templates</I> folder, and which is given to any
instances of the class that are instantiated without a title.  Since the
default title applies to all instances of the class, it is implemented in
a class method rather than an instance method.
<P>
The prefix "M_" denotes the metaclass in the SOM-generated "C" source.  As
already mentioned, the<!-- entering slot 294 --> first parameter passed
to a method is a pointer to a type of object that can invoke that method;
this is true for both instance methods and class methods; for a class method
the first parameter contains a pointer to an instance of the metaclass.

<PRE>            Pointer to instance of metaclass
            which is a class object ─────────┐
                                             
   pwfoldercls_wpclsQueryTitle(M_PWFolder *somSelf)
                                  
        Type is Metaclass ────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
Since a class is also an object, it follows that the class itself has its
own "instance data"; hence the next line of code appears as follows:
<PRE>    /* M_PWFolderData *somThis = M_PWFolderGetData(somSelf); */
</PRE>

<P>
This statement would access the SOM object's class data.  However, since
no class data is specified in the .CSC file, there is nothing to access
and so the SOM Precompiler has commented the line out to reflect this.
<P>
For simple examples, it is easier to use global variables in the DLL for
class data.  This technique has been used in <A HREF="049_L2_ClassMethodExample.html">Figure
"Class Method Example"</A>; the default title string is stored at the beginning
of the program into the global variable<I> szDefaultTitle</I>.  However,
using this technique means that class data can be accessed by instance methods,
which is never desirable, and may have adverse consequences, although these
may generally be avoided by sound programming techniques.
<P>
<B>Invoking Another Object's Methods</B>
<P>
An object may invoke a method in another object class.  This technique is
useful in a client-server situation, where one object creates another object
of a different class and then wishes to have that object perform certain
actions.  The system object model provides programming functions that can
be used to determine the necessary information and invoke the method.  An
example is given in <A HREF="050_L2_InvokingaMethodinAno.html">Figure "Invoking
a Method in Another Object Class"</A>.
<P>
The example given in <A HREF="050_L2_InvokingaMethodinAno.html">Figure "Invoking
a Method in Another Object Class"</A> shows part of a "database client"
object that sends a database query to a "database server" object.  The client
first allocates a shared memory object into which it loads the query.  The
client then uses the<I> _somFindClass</I> method and the<I> SOM_IdFromString
</I>macro to determine the object pointer for the object, and the method
identifier for the required method. The<I> _somDispatchL</I> method is then
used to invoke the method.
<P>
It is also possible to invoke a class method using the object pointer to
that class, obtained using the<I> _somFindClass</I> method shown in <A HREF="050_L2_InvokingaMethodinAno.html">Figure
"Invoking a Method in Another Object Class"</A>.  This requires the header
file for the class to be included in the source code for the class that
will invoke the method, using a<I> #include</I> statement.  In the module
definition file for the invoking class, the following IMPORT statements
must be provided:
<PRE>        IMPORTS
           record.RecordCClassData
           record.RecordClassData
           record.RecordNewClass
           record.M_RecordCClassData
           record.M_RecordClassData
           record.M_RecordNewClass
</PRE>

<P>
When these steps have been carried out, a method in the other class may
be invoked directly, as follows:
<PRE>_clsQueryDatabase(RecordClass,         /* Invoke class method   */
                  pQuery,              /* Method specific       */
                  Folder);             /* parameters            */
</PRE>

<P>
While this technique is less clean than the previous approach since it requires
the inclusion of the header file and import statements, it provides better
performance.
