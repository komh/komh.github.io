<P>
Windows may be subclassed by replacing the window procedure defined by the
window class with another window procedure.  This new subclass window procedure
typically processes some of the messages routed to it, and then calls the
original window procedure to process any other messages.  This technique
parallels the definition of subclassing given in <A HREF="187_L1_ObjectOrientedApplic.html">Object-Oriented
Applications</A>.
<P>
Presentation Manager implements subclassing by having the application call
the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function, specifying the handle of the window
to be subclassed and the new subclass window procedure.  Note that only
the window specified is affected by the<B> WinSubClassWindow()</B> function
call; other windows of the same class are not subclassed.  Once the call
is successfully issued, any messages destined for the original window procedure
are automatically routed to the subclass window procedure by Presentation
Manager.  The object (whether a window or the operating system) from which
the message originated is unaware of the subclass window procedure's interference.
 An example of a subclass window procedure is given in <A HREF="031_L2_SubclassWindowProced.html">Figure
"Subclass Window Procedure"</A>.
<P>
The subclassing concept enables messages destined for particular windows
to be intercepted and the processing resulting from certain messages to
be altered.  This provides a powerful mechanism that facilitates the creation
and use of generic windows (application objects), while retaining the ability
for the application to modify the behavior of such windows should the need
arise.  The use of subclassing enables a newly created window to take on
the properties and methods of existing window classes in accordance with
the principle of inheritance.
<P>
Presentation Manager enables the effect of subclassing a window to be reversed
by the application issuing the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> call a second
time for the same window, specifying the original window procedure.  Presentation
Manager then routes messages directly to their intended destination.  This
capability allows windows to be<I> temporarily</I> subclassed to meet changing
requirements at different points during application execution.
