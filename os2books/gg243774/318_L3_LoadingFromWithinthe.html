<H1>Loading From Within the Application</H1><!-- entering slot 351 -->
<P>
In the typical case, resources are incorporated into an application by passing
the resource script file to the resource compiler.  The resource compiler
compiles the resource definitions and incorporates them into an executable
file that has already been created.
<P>
Many of the functions that require a resource identifier, such as<B> WinLoadString()
</B>and<B> WinLoadPointer()</B>, also accept the identifier of a resource
file as one of their parameters.  For resources that are incorporated into
the application's .EXE file, this parameter should be specified as NULL.
 For example, to load a pointer from a resource defined within the .EXE
file, the following call is used:
<PRE>hPointer = WinLoadPointer(hDesktop,     /* Desktop handle           */
                          NULL,         /* Within .EXE file         */
                          DRAW);        /* Resource symbolic name   */
</PRE>

<P>
Other Presentation Manager functions that use this convention include<B> WinLoadAccelTable()</B>,
<B>WinLoadMenu()</B> and<B> WinCreateStdWindow()</B>.
