<P>
An application may also pass control synchronously to an external routine
such a macro or subprogram written using the <A HREF="670_L2_REXX.html"><B>Restructured
Extended Executor</B> (<B>REXX</B>)</A> procedure language.  This can be
achieved quite easily by calling the REXX command interpreter using the
<B>RexxStart()</B> function from any point within the application.  This
function is illustrated in <A HREF="042_L2_CallingExternalMacro.html">Figure
"Calling External Macros"</A>.
<P>
Commands are passed to the REXX interpreter using command strings defined
using the RXSTRING data type, which is defined in the<I> rexxsaa.h</I> header
file.  This structure contains the string pointer and an unsigned long integer
containing the length of the string in bytes.  A number of commands may
be passed in a single operation, by specifying an array of RXSTRING structures
in the second parameter to the<B> RexxStart()</B> function.  The first parameter
specifies the number of commands being passed.
<P>
The third parameter to the<B> RexxStart()</B> function defines the name
of the REXX procedure to be invoked.  In <A HREF="042_L2_CallingExternalMacro.html">Figure
"Calling External Macros"</A>, the procedure is contained in the file REXXPROC,
with an assumed default file extension of .CMD.
<P>
If the REXX procedure invoked by the application issues its own commands
such as SAY (to output information to the screen), a subcommand handler
must be specified in the<B> RexxStart()</B> function call, in order to trap
such output.  A subcommand handler is simply a subroutine which accepts,
as parameters, the function and subfunction names issued by the REXX procedure,
along with a pointer to an RXSTRING structure which may be used by the subcommand
handler to return any information to the REXX procedure. A subcommand handler
may reside within the application's main executable module or in a DLL,
and must be registered prior to issuing the<B> RexxStart()</B> function
call, using the<B> RexxRegisterSubcomExe()</B> or<B> RexxRegisterSubcomDll()
</B>functions.
<P>
The REXX interpreter's operating environment may be customized through the
use of user exits, whereby special routines may be inserted at particular
points in the interpreter's execution.  Such routines are specified using
an array of RXSYSEXIT structures, which identify the exit point and the
entry point address of the routine to be invoked at that point.  The address
of this array is passed in the<B> RexxStart()</B> function call.
<P>
Use of the REXX interpreter, the<B> RexxStart()</B> function and its supporting
functions are described in detail in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Technical
Library - Procedures Language/2 REXX Reference</I>.
