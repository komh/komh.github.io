<P>
Systems Application Architecture CUA guidelines recommend that an application
should complete  the processing of a user- or system-initiated event within
0.1 seconds and be ready to continue interaction with the end user.  The
particular implementation of the message handling concept under Presentation
Manager means that  the application's primary thread must complete the processing
of a Presentation Manager message<I> before</I> any further messages can
be passed to applications; thus it is possible for the user to be "locked
out" of the system if an application does not complete its processing within
a reasonable period of time.
<P>
While the 0.1 second time period is adequate for the processing of most
events, it may be insufficient for those that result in lengthy processing
such as access to a remote system.  It is therefore recommended that any
window procedure performing some processing that is likely to take longer
than 0.1 seconds to complete should carry out this processing using a separate
thread of execution under OS/2.  The application's primary thread may then
initiate the secondary thread and immediately return control to Presentation
Manager, thereby enabling the primary thread to continue with user interaction.

<P>
The separation of processing into a primary and one or more  secondary threads
may occur in a number of ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where the window procedure is an object window procedure,
and the majority of its methods may result in lengthy processing, the window
procedure itself may be implemented in a secondary thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where only a single method results in lengthy processing,
or where  the window procedure is concerned with a display object, a single
subroutine containing that method may be started in a secondary thread.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
In certain circumstances where the different portions of an  application's
task are entirely self-contained, and where it is  desirable to isolate
the portions from one another, the application may  be divided into separate
processes. Division of the application in this way means that each portion
resides and executes in its own address space, fully protected from other
 portions of the application.  This approach is particularly useful for
 applications that exploit the Workplace Shell, since the implementation
of the  Workplace Shell in OS/2 Version 2.0 causes Workplace Shell objects
to execute, by default, under the  control of the Workplace Shell process.
 The use of multiple processes within an  application provides better protection
for resources used by Workplace Shell  objects.
<P>
Note that for performance reasons, the use of multiple threads  within the
same process is preferable to the use of multiple  processes.  This is because
switching between threads involves far less  system overhead than switching
between processes.
<P>
Processes and threads may communicate with one another in a number  of ways
for the purposes of exchanging information, and for  synchronizing execution
flow and access to data objects.  The  techniques of communication between
threads and processes are described  in <A HREF="333_L2_CommunicatingWithaSe.html">Communicating
With a Secondary Thread</A> and <A HREF="336_L2_CommunicatingWithAno.html">Communicating
With Another Process</A>.
<P>
Maintaining synchronization between threads and processes is discussed in
