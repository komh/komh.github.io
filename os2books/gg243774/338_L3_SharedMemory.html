<H1>Shared Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 372 -->
<P>
Shared memory objects may be allocated and used to pass information between
specific processes.  Such memory objects may be named or anonymous.
<P>
The example that follows assumes that two processes are created in the system:
a client process that accepts user input and displays results, and a server
process that accepts requests from the client,  accesses data objects and
returns the requested data to the client.  Both of these processes create
windows.
<P>
In order to communicate a request to the server, the client must  first
allocate a shared memory object, using the <B> DosAllocSharedMem()</B> function
as described in <A HREF="227_L1_TheFlatMemoryModel.html">The Flat Memory
Model</A>.  Since the process  ID of the server process is known to the
client, the client can provide  access to the shared memory object for the
server process, using the <B> DosGiveSharedMem()</B> function, which is
also described in <A HREF="227_L1_TheFlatMemoryModel.html">The Flat Memory
Model</A>.  This technique  is shown in <A HREF="090_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Shared Memory (Part 1)"</A>.
<P>
If the technique described in <A HREF="327_L2_CreatingAnotherProce.html">Creating
Another Process</A> is followed, and the  server process has posted a message
to the client at the completion of  server initialization, containing the
window handle of the server's  object window, the client can dispatch the
request as an  application-defined Presentation Manager message to the server's
object window, with  a pointer to the memory object as a message parameter.
 The server process then obtains access to the object using the<B> DosGetSharedMem()
</B>function, as shown in <A HREF="091_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Shared Memory (Part 2)"</A>.
<P>
In the simplest case where the client process has only one window,  the
handle of this window is passed to the server process when it is  created,
as part of the<B> DosExecPgm()</B> call, as shown in <A HREF="087_L2_StartingaChildProces.html">Figure
"Starting a Child Process"</A>.  Hence the server has access to the client's
 window handle and can pass the return data to the client.  In a more complex
situation where the client process has several windows and where a request
can come from any of these, the handle can be passed as part of the request
structure, as shown in <A HREF="090_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Shared Memory (Part 1)"</A> and  <A HREF="091_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure
"Interprocess Communication Using Shared Memory (Part 2)"</A>.
<P>
Another issue that arises when using shared memory to communicate  between
processes is that of freeing the shared memory object.  When a  process
issues a<B> DosGiveSharedMem()</B> or<B> DosGetSharedMem()</B> call, the
operating system increments a usage counter for the shared memory object,
and will not release the memory until all processes  using the object have
issued a<B> DosFreeMem()</B> call.
<P>
For the server process that receives access to the shared memory  object,
the<B> DosFreeMem()</B> call is simply made whenever the server process
has finished with the contents of the memory object.  For the client process
that initially creates the memory object, the<B> DosFreeMem()</B> call can
be made  at either of two points:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the client process does not care whether the request
is  correctly received by the server process, the<B> DosFreeMem()</B>  call
can be made immediately after passing the message to the server,  as shown
in <A HREF="090_L2_InterprocessCommunic.html">Figure "Interprocess Communication
Using Shared Memory (Part 1)"</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the client wishes to guarantee delivery of the
request, it must pass the message, wait for an acknowledgement of receipt
from the server, and then issue the<B> DosFreeMem()</B> call.  This  acknowledgement
may simply be an indication of receipt, prior to the  server processing
the request, or may be the returned data from the  request.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that it is common for returned data from a request to be passed  using
the same memory object as was used to contain the original  request.  In
such cases, the memory object cannot be freed by the  client process until
the returned data is received and processed.
