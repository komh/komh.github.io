<H1>Generic Routines Header File</H1><!-- entering slot 513 -->
<P>
One or more source modules in an application may contain generic routines
that are accessed from multiple source modules within the application. These
source modules may possess their own local header files to define data and
functions accessed only from within their own module.  In addition, such
source modules should possess a single generic routines header file per
application, which should contain:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Prototypes for all generic functions and subroutines
that will be accessed from other source modules within the application<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Declarations for data types and constants necessary
to the invocation of these generic routines.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The generic routines header file should be referenced, via an appropriate
<I>#include</I> statement, by its own source modules and by each source
module within the application that requires access to generic routines.
