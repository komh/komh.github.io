class-based
<P>
Term used to describe an implementation of object-oriented programming,
whereby object classes are defined in terms of other, previously-defined
object classes; the new class takes on the properties and methods of the
existing class or classes, in accordance with the principle of inheritance.
 The various dependencies thus formed constitute an inheritance hierarchy.
 Such an approach facilitates the creation of new object classes with minimal
effort, but at the expense of increased interdependence and reduced object
granularity.  Compare with <A HREF="622_L2_modulebased.html">module-based
