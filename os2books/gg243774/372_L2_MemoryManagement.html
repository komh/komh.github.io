<P>
The 64KB segment size limitation imposed by the Intel 80286 processor architecture
has been eliminated in OS/2 Version 2.0, avoiding the need for applications
to allocate large data structures in individual units of 64KB. The flat
memory model implemented under OS/2 Version 2.0 allows applications to request
the allocation of individual memory objects up to 512MB in size, using the
<B>DosAllocMem()</B> function, an example of which is shown in <A HREF="112_L2_DosAllocMemFunction.html">Figure
"DosAllocMem() Function"</A>.
<P>
The above example shows the allocation of 73KB of memory as a single memory
object, with read and write access permitted.  The PAG_COMMIT flag is set
in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call, in order to commit the storage
immediately.
