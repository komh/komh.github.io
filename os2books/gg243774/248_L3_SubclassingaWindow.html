<H1>Subclassing a Window</H1><!-- entering slot 266 -->
<P>
The use of subclassing to modify the methods of an existing window class
has been described in <A HREF="225_L2_Subclassing.html">Subclassing</A>.
 An application subclasses a particular window instance (rather than the
entire window class) by creating a<B> subclass window procedure</B>, and
registering this window procedure to Presentation Manager using the<B> WinSubclassWindow()
</B>function.
<P>
The use of the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function is shown in <A HREF="030_L2_WinSubclassWindowFun.html">Figure
"WinSubclassWindow() Function"</A>.
<P>
The<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function substitutes a new window procedure,
known as the<B> subclass window procedure</B>, for the original window procedure
associated with the window being subclassed.  The window handle of the window,
along with the entry point of the  subclass window procedure, is passed
to the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> function.  The function returns the entry
point address of the original window procedure for that window.
<P>
Once a window has been subclassed, Presentation Manager routes messages
destined for that window to the subclass window procedure. The subclass
window procedure may:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Process the message itself, if it indicates an action
for which the method must be modified.
<P>
The subclass window procedure then returns control immediately to Presentation
Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Pass the message on to the original window procedure
for that window, if the subclass window procedure is not explicitly concerned
with the action indicated by the message.
<P>
The original window procedure is directly invoked by the subclass window
procedure; note that this is one of the few instances where direct invocation
of a window procedure is recommended.  The return code from the original
window procedure is then returned to Presentation Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Both of the above, if the subclass window procedure
must perform some processing in addition to that normally performed by the
original window procedure.
<P>
The additional processing performed by the subclass window procedure may
be performed either before or after the processing performed by the original
window procedure.  This sequence is at the discretion of the application
developer, and depends largely on the desired modification in the window's
behavior.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
A subclass window procedure is similar in structure to a "normal" window
procedure, except that instead of calling the<B> WinDefWindowProc()</B> function
as its default case, it should invoke the original window procedure.  This
means that the entry point address of the original window procedure must
be known to and accessible from the subclass window procedure.  Note also
that the entry point address might not be that of the original window procedure
specified when the window class was registered to Presentation Manager,
since the window might previously have been subclassed, and the current
subclassing operation might be effectively subclassing the subclass window
procedure.
<P>
The entry point address of the original procedure can be supplied to the
subclass window procedure in a number of ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It may be determined from the information returned
by the<B> WinSubclassWindow()</B> call, and passed to the subclass window
procedure in an application-defined message.  The subclass window procedure
may then store the entry point address in a global variable or in the window
words of the window, assuming the available window words are not already
in use.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It may be determined by the subclass window procedure
itself by querying Presentation Manager.  Note, however, that this method
will only work if the window has not previously been subclassed, since Presentation
Manager only records the original window procedure (as specified in the
<B>WinRegisterClass()</B> function call) in the CLASSINFO structure for
the window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
An example of a subclass window procedure, including a query to obtain the
original entry point address from the Presentation Manager class information,
is given in <A HREF="031_L2_SubclassWindowProced.html">Figure "Subclass
Window Procedure"</A>. <A HREF="031_L2_SubclassWindowProced.html">Figure
"Subclass Window Procedure"</A> shows each of the possible cases listed
above.  The message class WMP_MESSAGE1 is explicitly processed by the subclass
window procedure, which then returns control to Presentation Manager with
a<I> return</I> statement upon completion.
<P>
The message class WMP_MESSAGE2 is also explicitly processed by the subclass
window procedure, but in this case it is required that the processing performed
by the original window procedure be allowed to occur, after the subclass
window procedure's processing.  The subclass window procedure therefore
does not return control immediately to Presentation Manager, but merely
terminates the<I> switch</I> statement, allowing  the final four statements
to be executed.
<P>
For other message classes with which the subclass window procedure is not
concerned, the default case also terminates the<I> switch</I> statement,
allowing the final four statements to be executed.
<P>
These final statements determine the entry point address of the original
window procedure, using the<B> WinQueryClassName()</B> and<B> WinQueryClassInfo()
</B>functions to access control information held by Presentation Manager.
 This entry point address is then used to invoke the original window procedure
to process messages with which the subclass window procedure is not concerned,
or for which the normal processing must be allowed to occur.
<P>
The last four statements in the example above are common to all subclass
window procedures, and organizations undertaking development of Presentation
Manager applications may wish to incorporate them<!-- entering slot 267 --> into
a standard subroutine and place them in a library for access by developers.

<P>
Note that a subclass window procedure, like all window and dialog procedures,
must use the<I> system</I> linkage convention.  This is normally achieved
by declaring the subclass window procedure using the EXPENTRY keyword.
