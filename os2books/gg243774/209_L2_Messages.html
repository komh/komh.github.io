<P>
All interaction between the user and windows, or between one window and
another in the Presentation Manager environment, takes place by way of <A HREF="614_L2_message.html"><B>messages</B></A>.
Whenever the user presses a key, moves or clicks the mouse, selects an item
from a menu, etc., a message is generated and placed on a system message
queue.  Presentation Manager takes these messages in the order they were
received by the system, determines the window for which each message is
intended, and routes the message to a message queue belonging to the application
that "owns" that window.  The application then dequeues each message in
turn, and routes the message via Presentation Manager to the window procedure
associated with that window, which processes the message.
<P>
Messages may be of three types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>User-initiated</I> ; that is, the message is generated
as the result of the user selecting an action-bar item, pressing a key,
etc.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Application-initiated</I> ; that is, the message
is generated by one window within the application for the communication
of an event or required action to another window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>System-initiated</I> ; that is, the message is
generated by Presentation Manager as the result of some system event such
as a window having been resized or moved.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
A Presentation Manager application has the ability to process messages of
any of the three types, which allows the application to respond to any type
of event, regardless of its origin.
