Linkage convention used in C programming that causes the compiler to generate
object code for a function or subroutine, such that parameters are placed
on the stack in left-to-right order when the subroutine is called, and the
stack is cleared by the called subroutine when control is returned.  Originally
introduced by Microsoft with early versions of Microsoft Windows, when this
convention saved several hundred bytes of system memory, and adopted by
Presentation Manager under OS/2 Version 1.3.  Contrast with <A HREF="516_L2_cdecl.html"><I>cdecl
