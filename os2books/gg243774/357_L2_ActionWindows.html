<P>
Under the guidelines provided by CUA'91, a dialog box is known as an <A HREF="499_L2_actionwindow.html"><B>action
window</B></A>.  Since this chapter discusses CUA guidelines, this term
will be used herein when referring to the provisions made by CUA.  The term
"dialog box" will be used when referring to the implementation of these
concepts under Presentation Manager.
<P>
Action windows used by an application may be either modal or modeless, although
modeless windows are preferred under CUA. Both types of action window are
defined as <A HREF="638_L2_optimizedwindow.html"><B>optimized windows</B></A>;
that is, they are created at a predefined optimal size for their function,
and may not be resized by the user.  However, the use of each type of action
window is different, as explained below.
<P>
A dialog box is typically created using the Dialog Box Editor application
supplied as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>, and
is defined in a dialog template which is stored in a .DLG file and referenced
from  the application's resource script file.  Dialog templates are fully
 described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application Design Guide</I>.

<P>
It is recommended that wherever possible, action windows should be created
with a title bar.  Since action windows typically appear as the result of
a menu bar item being selected, the title bar should contain the name of
the parent object, plus the same text as the menu bar item.  This provides
the user with a visual indication of the action which led to the action
window being displayed.
<P>
As already mentioned, an action window should not be sizable by the user,
although it may be movable.  Similarly, a modal action window should not
include minimize or maximize icons, since the user must complete the interaction
with the action window at its optimal size prior to continuing with execution.
 In the case of a modeless action window, there is no point in providing
a maximize icon since the window is created at an optimal size for the information
it will contain. However, since a user may wish to suspend the dialog in
order to interact with other windows, the user may wish to remove the action
window from the desktop.  In such cases, a modeless action window should
include a minimize icon.
