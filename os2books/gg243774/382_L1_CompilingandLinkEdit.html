<H1>Compiling and Link Editing an Application</H1><!-- entering slot 424 -->
<P>
A Presentation Manager application, written in a high-level language such
as C, is compiled and link-edited in a similar fashion to a regular OS/2
or DOS application.  System Object Model object classes are created in a
similar way.  However, additional steps are required for the creation of
a Workplace Shell object class, prior to compilation of the C source code.

<P>
This chapter describes the process of creating an executable Presentation
Manager application or system object model object class.  The chapter describes
the process of precompilation for system object model object classes, and
the compilation, link edit and resource compilation stages for both system
object model object classes and Presentation Manager applications.
<P>
<A HREF="119_L2_DevelopmentProcessfo.html">Figure "Development Process for
New WPS Classes"</A> shows the overall process used to create a new class
in the Workplace Shell:
<P>
The starting point for a system object model class is the class definition
file which, for classes written using the C language, has an extension of
.CSC.  The class definition file is used as input to the SOM Precompiler,
which will generate a number of files from the class definition file:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B><LI>H</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> A public header file for programs that
use the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .PH</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> A
private header file, which provides usage bindings to any private methods
implemented by the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .IH</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> An
implementation header file, which provides macros, etc., to support the
implementation of the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .C</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> A
template C file, to which code may be added to implement the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .SC
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>A language-neutral class definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .PSC
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>A private language-neutral core file, which contains
private parts of the interface for the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> .DEF
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>An OS/2 DLL module definition file containing
the relevant exports needed to implement the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
