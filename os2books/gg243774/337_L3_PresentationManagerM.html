<P>
When a child process creates its own windows, Presentation Manager messages
can be  used to signal events and/or pass information between the parent
and  child processes, provided the windows' handles are known to one another.
 One technique for passing window handles during process creation is described
in <A HREF="327_L2_CreatingAnotherProce.html">Creating Another Process</A>.
 Even where the child process does not create its  own windows, it may use
Presentation Manager messages to indicate events and pass  information to
its parent process.
<P>
The amount of information which can be passed in a Presentation Manager
message is somewhat limited, due to the four-byte size of each message parameter.
 The use of Presentation Manager messages for passing information is therefore
 typically combined with other mechanisms such as shared memory or atoms.
 The message parameters are then used to carry pointers to shared memory
objects, or string handles that are then used by the child process to access
the required information.
