<H1>Maintaining User Responsiveness</H1><!-- entering slot 405 -->
<P>
The particular implementation of the message handling concept under Presentation
Manager means that it is possible for a user to be "locked out" of the system
if a window procedure does not return from processing a message within a
reasonable period of time, since Presentation Manager only dispatches messages
from the system queue to other applications when the currently active application
attempts to retrieve  a message from its queue.
<P>
The "reasonable" period of time is defined under Presentation Manager guidelines
to be 0.1 seconds; a window procedure should complete the processing of
a message within this period and return control to the application's main
routine in order that the main routine may issue its next<B> WinGetMsg()
</B>call.  While this time period is adequate for processing of most messages,
it may be insufficient for some messages; for examples, those that involve
lengthy operations such as access to a remote system.
<P>
In order to avoid the situation where an application or the entire Presentation
Manager environment is unresponsive to the end user, OS/2 allows applications
to create secondary threads of execution to handle lengthy  processing,
thus enabling the application's primary thread to continue  responding to
user interaction.  Presentation Manager also provides a number of methods
by which synchronization between threads may be achieved in order to ensure
the integrity of the user's intention and of data resources manipulated
by the application.  The use of secondary threads, and techniques for synchronizing
execution between threads and processes, are discussed in <A HREF="323_L1_MultitaskingConsider.html">Multitasking
Considerations</A>.
