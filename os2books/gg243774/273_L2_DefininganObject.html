<H1>Defining an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 296 -->
<P>
The definition of an object is achieved using a language known as the<B> Object
Interface Definition Language</B>. The statements that define an object
class are entered into the class definition file for the class, which is
an ASCII file and may thus be created using any normal text editor.  The
class definition file is used as input to the SOM Precompiler, which will
generate a number of files from the class definition file.
