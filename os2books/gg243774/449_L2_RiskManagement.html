<P>
In any application development project, there are risks imposed by the use
of new technologies and methods.  These risks may be divided into two basic
types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Technological risk; that which is imposed by new or
unfamiliar technologies which will be used in an application or during the
creation of the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Managerial risk; that which arises from the lack of
established management techniques to support new technologies and methods.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
These two elements of risk are closely related, and affect one another in
a variety of ways.  The following sections discuss both elements and suggest
some mechanisms for their mitigation.
