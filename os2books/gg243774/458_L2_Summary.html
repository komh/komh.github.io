<P>
The management and mitigation of risk during the application development
process is an important aspect of managing application development, particularly
where new or unfamiliar technologies are to be used.  There are two closely
related elements of risk that arise from the incorporation of new technologies.
 These are<I> technological risk</I>, which arises from the need for adequate
skills to exercise the technologies, and<I> managerial risk</I>, which arises
from the need for adequate administration and control mechanisms to ensure
that maximum benefit is gained from the use of the technologies.  It is
the responsibility of a development manager to assess, quantify and weigh
the potential benefits of new technologies against the risk involved in
their use, and to provide adequate mitigation of these risks.
<P>
The issue of configuration management in a distributed, workstation-based
development environment is another issue that must be addressed in order
to support the large-scale development of workstation-based applications.
 The use of a local area network as a development platform for such applications
has a number of benefits, particularly from the viewpoint of configuration
management and control over application resources such as source code, Presentation
Manager resources, test data and the like.  The use of a LAN provides:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Common access by all developers to production level
versions of application resources<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The ability to directly access these production level
versions during the build process<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The ability to combine production level versions with
user level versions of application resources during the build process<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The ability to manage and regulate the modification
and update of production level application resources.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The proper use of a LAN in the workstation-based development environment,
and the achievement of the aforementioned benefits, requires the adoption
of and adherence to a consistent set of standards in the areas of module
naming, access and testing, and a measure of discipline on the part of application
developers.  However, it is considered that the increased time and effort
expended in maintaining these standards is more than offset by the reduced
incidence of error and wastage of development time and effort imposed by
the lack of adequate coordination and control in a multi-developer project.

<P>
The issues of management and control in the workstation-based development
environment are of increasing importance as organizations begin to develop
and deploy line-of-business applications on workstation platforms.  These
issues may be adequately addressed by the use of appropriate tools and the
adaptation and application of existing management techniques.  With the
proper care and planning, the maximum benefit may be obtained from the use
of the workstation as a development and delivery platform for business applications.
