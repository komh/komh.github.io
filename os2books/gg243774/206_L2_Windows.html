A window is the embodiment of an application object within the Presentation
Manager application model.  To the end user, a window appears as a rectangular
display area on the screen.  From an application viewpoint however, the
concept of a window is far more powerful than this. Windows may be of two
basic types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Display windows</B> have a physical identity represented
by a rectangular area on a screen; in this case the window represents a
view of a conceptual display surface known as a <A HREF="651_L2_presentationspace.html"><B>presentation
space</B></A>, which is in fact a data entity being represented on the screen.
 This is the average end user's concept of a window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="634_L2_objectwindow.html"><B>Object windows
</B></A>have no physical manifestation, and are merely addresses or "handles"
to which messages may be directed.  An object window is typically associated
with an entity such as a file or database, and is used to access this entity
and perform actions upon it.  The object window concept is very important
to the implementation of object-oriented principles under Presentation Manager,
since it enables the creation of non-visual objects within the Presentation
Manager application model.  See <A HREF="222_L3_ParentChildRelations.html">Parent/Child
RelationShip (Object Windows)</A> for further information.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Windows respond to events, communicated by way of <A HREF="614_L2_message.html"><B>messages</B></A>,
which may originate from Presentation Manager as a result of user interaction,
or from other windows existing in the system.  Messages are routed to and
between windows by Presentation Manager on behalf of the application.  Windows
may interpret and process messages in different ways, in accordance with
the concept of polymorphism.
<P>
Each window existing in the system has a unique identifier known as its
<A HREF="711_L2_windowhandle.html"><B>window handle</B></A>, which is assigned
by Presentation Manager when the window is created. This handle is used
to identify a window in all communication between that window and other
parties, such as Presentation Manager or the user.  The window handle is
specified as the destination address used when passing messages to a window.
 See <A HREF="209_L2_Messages.html">Messages</A> for further discussion
of Presentation Manager messages.  A window is always aware of its own handle,
since the handle is part of every message passed to the window.  Presentation
Manager provides a number of mechanisms by which a window may determine
the handles of other windows in the system in order to pass messages to
those windows; these mechanisms are described in <A HREF="249_L2_WindowCommunication.html">Window
Communication</A>.
