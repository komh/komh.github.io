<P>
This section of the document describes the functions that are available
to application programs for accessing operating system services.  Note that
only the operating system kernel functions are described in this section,
since the Presentation Manager programming interface has not significantly
changed, although a number of new Presentation Manager functions have been
added.
<P>
The following tables list the kernel functions available under OS/2 Version
1.3 and their equivalent function under OS/2 Version 2.0, categorized by
function area.
