<H1>Using an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 306 -->
<P>
A user typically accesses an object by opening a <A HREF="706_L2_view.html"><B>view
</B></A>of that object.  For example, to access the contents of a folder
object, the user opens the default view (usually an icon view) of the folder,
which then displays its contents.  This is certainly true for container
objects such as folders, and for the password-protected folder class used
as an example in this chapter, although other "device" objects such as printers
or the shredder may be used without a view.
<P>
When no view of an object is open,<I> and</I> the folder within which the
object resides is not open, the object is said to be <A HREF="550_L2_dormant.html"><B>dormant</B></A>;
 typically, no system resources are allocated to the object and its instance
data is in an unknown state.  Opening and closing views of an object therefore
involve not only the opening and closing of windows, but also allocating
and freeing resources, and saving and restoring the instance data of the
object.  Similarly, opening a folder requires saving and restoring the instance
data of the objects in that folder.
<P>
<B>Opening an Object</B>
<P>
As mentioned above, a user typically interacts with an object using a view
of that object.  An object may support various types of view; for example,
the<I> WPFolder</I> object class supports icon, tree, details and settings
views. By default, an object class supports the view types defined by its
ancestors, and a programmer may also define new view types for the object
class.
<P>
When a view of an object is opened, a method named<I> _wpOpen</I> is invoked
by the Workplace Shell.  This method is defined and implemented by the base
storage class<I> WPObject</I>, and may be overridden by a new object class
to perform its own class-specific processing.  The supported views for each
object class are implemented as part of the<I> _wpOpen</I> method, using
Presentation Manager windows.
<P>
When a view is opened by the user from a context menu, the<I> _wpMenuItemSelected
</I>method is invoked (see <A HREF="271_L3_Methods.html">Methods (Attaching
a Method to the Context Menu)</A> for more detailed discussion of this method).
 The<I> _wpMenuItemSelected</I> method typically invokes the<I> _wpOpen
</I>method, and passes the identifier of the requested view as the third
parameter.  The<I> _wpOpen</I> method may then interrogate this parameter
to decide which view to open.
<P>
When the user opens a view by double-clicking the mouse on an object's icon,
the system invokes the<I> _wpOpen</I> method and passes an OPEN_DEFAULT
value.  The default processing for the<I> _wpOpen</I> method invokes the
<I>_wpQueryDefaultView</I> method to determine the default view for the
object, and immediately invokes the<I> _wpOpen</I> method a second time
with the identifier for that view.
<P>
An example of an overridden<I> _wpOpen</I> method is given in <A HREF="058_L2_OpeninganObject.html">Figure
"Opening an Object"</A>.  This example shows a password-protection facility
being added to a folder to prevent access by unauthorized users.  Upon invocation
of the<I> _wpOpen</I> method, the password-protected folder object class
displays a dialog box to accept a password from the user.  It then compares
that password with the correct password for that folder before actually
opening the folder.  Visual cues such as the folder's icon and the word
"Locked" on the folder's title are modified or removed during the<I> _wpOpen
</I>processing.
<P>
Since the view being opened in this case is the icon view defined by the
<I>WPFolder</I> class, the actual opening of the view and presentation of
the folder's contents is handled using the default processing supplied by
the parent class, which is called after the class-specific processing has
completed.
<P>
If an object class wishes to create a new view, it must add the name of
the view to the<I> Open</I> submenu in the object's context menu, and include
a case for that view in the<I> _wpMenuItemSelected</I> method. This method
then invokes<I> _wpOpen</I> with a specific value in the<I> ulView</I> parameter,
indicating the view to be opened.  The class-specific processing for<I> _wpOpen
</I>must test for this value, open a window and display the correct information
using Presentation Manager functions.
<P>
The example in <A HREF="058_L2_OpeninganObject.html">Figure "Opening an
Object"</A> does not include the code to set the folder's icon to the "unlocked"
state.  This code is identical to the code used in <A HREF="046_L2_AddingaNewMethod.html">Figure
"Adding a New Method"</A> to set the icon to the "locked" state; the resource
identifier of the "unlocked" icon is simply substituted in the<I> _wpOpen
</I>method for the identifier of the "locked" icon.
<P>
Note that in many cases, it is important for an object class to allow the
default processing for<I> _wpOpen</I> to occur<I> before</I> it<!-- entering slot 307 --> attempts
to carry out its own processing.  This allows instance data and control
information to be established and initialized before the object attempts
any processing using these items.  In <A HREF="058_L2_OpeninganObject.html">Figure
"Opening an Object"</A> however, the additional class-specific processing
determines whether the object should open<I> at all</I>; if processing is
allowed to proceed, no alteration to the default processing takes place.
 The default processing may therefore be carried out after the additional
class-specific processing introduced by the password-protected folder class.

<P>
The default processing for the<I> _wpOpen</I> method supports a number of
views, depending upon the parent class of the object; for example, the processing
for the<I> WPFolder</I> class supports ICON, TREE and DETAILS views.  For
new object classes which support additional views, the<I> _wpOpen</I> method
must be overridden and the additional view types opened explicitly as windows
using appropriate Presentation Manager functions.  Since a view of an object
is essentially a window, new views can be implemented as normal Presentation
Manager windows and the correct information displayed using text or graphical
programming functions, according to the requirements of the object class.

<P>
Note that upon opening a view using a Presentation Manager window, an object
should add itself to the "Use List" maintained by the Workplace Shell.  If
the view is the first view of the object to be opened, this causes the Workplace
Shell to modify the object's icon to indicate the "in use" state.  The object
should also register the view with the Workplace Shell, which will then
subclass the view's frame window, automatically attach the object's context
menu to the window's system menu icon, and add the view to the Workplace
Shell's Window List.  These steps are done using the<I> _wpAddToObjUseList
</I>and<I> _wpRegisterView</I> methods, as shown in <A HREF="059_L2_OpeningaCustomViewof.html">Figure
"Opening a Custom View of an Object"</A>.
<P>
The Workplace Shell makes use of a USEITEM and a VIEWITEM structure in the
<I>_wpAddToObjUseList</I> method.  It assumes that these structures are
contiguous in memory; hence they should be allocated as part of a larger
data structure such as the OBJECTVIEW structure shown in <A HREF="059_L2_OpeningaCustomViewof.html">Figure
"Opening a Custom View of an Object"</A>.  A pointer to this structure is
stored in the window words of the view window, so that information such
as the object's pointer can be accessed from the view's window procedure.

<P>
Note that upon closing a view, the view's window procedure should invoke
the<I> _wpDeleteFromObjUseList</I> method to remove the view from the Use
List.  If the view is the only open view of the object, the object's icon
is modified to remove the "in use" emphasis.
<P>
<B>Automatic Opening Upon Instantiation</B>
<P>
In many cases, it is desirable to automatically open a view of an object
when the object is created.  This may be achieved by using the OPEN= keyword
in the setup string passed to the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> function.  An
example of this technique is shown in <A HREF="060_L2_AutomaticallyInstant.html">Figure
"Automatically Instantiating an Object"</A>.
<P>
The opening of the view specified in the OPEN= keyword is handled by the
default processing for the<I> _wpSetup</I> method, as defined by the<I> WPObject
</I>class.  The default processing supports the icon, tree and details views,
specified using the ICON, TREE and DETAILS values for the OPEN= keyword
respectively.  For new object classes that support additional views, the
<I>_wpSetup</I> method must be overridden and the additional view types
opened explicitly as windows using appropriate Presentation Manager functions.

<P>
<B>Closing an Object</B>
<P>
When all open views of an object are to be closed, the<I> _wpClose</I> method
is invoked.  This method is normally invoked when the user selects the<I> Close
</I>option from a view's context menu.
<P>
The<I> _wpClose</I> method may be overridden to perform class-specific processing
for closing views, or to free system resources allocated during processing
of the<I> _wpOpen</I> method.  For example, <A HREF="061_L2_ClosinganObject.html">Figure
"Closing an Object"</A> shows the<I> _wpClose</I> method being overridden
to automatically lock a password-protected folder whenever it is closed
by the user.
<P>
When a view of an object is closed, the system sends a WM_DESTROY message
to the view's frame window.  This allows the object to release any allocated
resources and save its instance data, so that the object may be reopened
in its<!-- entering slot 308 --> current state at some future time.
<P>
Note that since the<I> _wpClose</I> method is defined by the parent class
and is overridden, the default processing performed by the parent is called
after the class-specific processing has completed.
<P>
<B>Saving and Restoring the Object State</B>
<P>
As already mentioned, an object is persistent; that is, it remains in existence
even when all views of the object are closed.  In order to maintain its
instance data so that it may subsequently be opened in the same state in
which it was closed, the object must save this data when its views are closed
and restore it when a view is opened.  The Workplace Shell provides methods
that handle the saving and restoration of instance data on behalf of object
classes; these methods are automatically invoked by the system at the appropriate
times, and are described below.
<P>
When an object is made dormant, the system invokes the object's<I> _wpSaveState
</I>method, which allows the object to save its instance data.  A number
of predefined methods are available to the object to save its data, such
as<I> _wpSaveString</I>. These methods may be called by the object during
the processing of its<I> _wpSaveState</I> method, in order to save instance
data.  An example of the<I> _wpSaveState</I> method for the password-protected
folder example is given in <A HREF="062_L2_SavinganObjectsState.html">Figure
"Saving an Object's State"</A>.
<P>
An object's instance data items are saved in different locations, depending
upon the class of the object.  Object classes that are descendants of the
<I>WPAbstract</I> class store their instance data in the OS/2 initialization
file OS2.INI.  Object classes that are descendants of the<I> WPFileSystem
</I>class store their instance data in extended attributes.  Since the password-protected
folder class is descended from the<I> WPFolder</I> class defined by the
Workplace Shell, which in turn is a descendant of the<I> WPFileSystem</I> class,
the instance data of this object class is saved as extended attributes in
the OS/2 file system.
<P>
The class-defined key passed to the<I> _wpSaveString</I> method is used
to save the data item in a particular location, which can then be accessed,
using the same key, to restore the item.  In addition to strings, numeric
data may be saved using the<I> _wpSaveLong</I> method, and other binary
data such as application-defined data structures may be saved using the
<I>_wpSaveData</I> method.
<P>
Note that since the<I> _wpSaveState</I> method is defined by the object's
class's ancestors and overridden, it must invoke the default processing
supplied by the parent class in order to correctly save any instance data
defined by ancestor classes.  Failure to do so may cause unpredictable results
upon awakening the object from its dormant state.
<P>
An object must retrieve its instance data and restore its state whenever
it is made awake.  At this point, the system invokes an object's<I> _wpRestoreState
method</I>, which allows the object to restore its state.  During the processing
of this method, the object can invoke other methods such as<I> _wpRestoreString</I>,
which restore specific instance data items.  An example of the<I> _wpRestoreState
</I>method is given in <A HREF="063_L2_RestoringanObjectsSt.html">Figure
"Restoring an Object's State"</A>.
<P>
The class-defined key passed to the<I> _wpRestoreString</I> method is used
to locate the required data item, and the item is restored into the specified
target string variable.  Numeric data can be restored using the<I> _wpRestoreLong
</I>method, and other binary data such as application-defined structures
can be restored using the<I> _wpRestoreData</I> method.
<P>
Since the<I> _wpRestoreState</I> method is an overridden method, it is important
that the default processing supplied by the parent class be invoked. Failure
to do so will result in any instance data defined by ancestor classes being
in an unknown state, with unpredictable results.
