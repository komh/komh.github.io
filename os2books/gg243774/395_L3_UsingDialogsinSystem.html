<H1>Using Dialogs in System Object Model Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 437 -->
<P>
In the folder example, a dialog box is used to prompt the user for the folder's
password, and for the user to enter the password.  Creating and invoking
the dialog is done in the normal way.  However, invoking an object's methods
from within a dialog procedure requires that the dialog procedure know the
pointer to the object that invokes the method (that is,<I> somSelf</I>).
 This is done through the use of the<I> pCreateParams</I> parameter of the
<B>WinDialogBox()</B> function.  In this way, the pointer to somSelf is
passed to the dialog procedure as follows:
<PRE>   pCreateParams = (PVOID)somSelf;
</PRE>

<P>
The dialog procedure may then store the pointer in the reserved window word
QWL_USER:
<PRE>    case WM_INITDLG:
         WinSetWindowULong(hwndDlg,      /* Set window word           */
                           QWL_USER,     /* Offset of window word     */
                           (ULONG) mp2); /* Value to be stored        */
        break;
</PRE>

<P>
When an instance method must be invoked from the dialog procedure, the object
pointer may easily be retrieved from the window words and used to invoke
the method.
<PRE>   {
      PWFolder *aPWF;                         /* Object pointer       */

      PWF_INFO pwfolderInfo;                  /* Folder info struct   */

      aPWF = (PWFolder *)WinQueryWindowULong( /* Get object pointer   */
                            hwndDlg,          /* Dialog box handle    */
                            QWL_USER);        /* Offset of win word   */

      _QueryInfo(                             /* Invoke method        */
                 aPWF,                        /* Object pointer       */
                 &amp;pwfolderInfo);              /* Folder info struct   */
   }
</PRE>

<P>
In the above example, a<B> WinQueryWindowULong()</B> call is used to retrieve
the object pointer from the window word, and store it in<I> aPWF</I>.  This
variable is then used as the first parameter when invoking the method<I> _QueryInfo</I>.

<P>
Note that the method name<I> _QueryInfo</I> is in fact fully defined as
<I>pwfolder_QueryInfo</I>.  However, as noted in <A HREF="276_L3_CImplementationofanO.html">C
Implementation of an Object Class</A>, the SOM Precompiler automatically
generates a macro to define the abbreviated form of the function name, in
order to avoid the necessity for the programmer to type the full name.
