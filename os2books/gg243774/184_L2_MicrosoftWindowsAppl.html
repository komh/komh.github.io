<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability for Microsoft Windows applications
to run under OS/2 Version 2.0, in virtual DOS machines.  This support allows
applications written for Windows 3.0 and previous versions of Windows to
coexist and execute concurrently in the same machine.
<P>
Each Windows applications executes as a protected mode process.  Windows
applications are therefore subject to the full memory protection facilities
provided to protected mode applications under OS/2 Version 2.0, and are
protected from one another and from DOS or OS/2 applications executing in
the system. This is in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment, where
limited protection is provided for Windows 3.0 applications, and none at
all for DOS applications unless Windows is running in enhanced mode.
<P>
The execution of Windows applications as protected mode tasks also allows
these applications to take full advantage of the pre-emptive multitasking
capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0, with full pre-emptive multitasking between
Windows applications, DOS applications and OS/2 applications.  This is again
in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment, where pre-emptive multitasking
is available only for DOS applications, only when Windows 3.0 is running
in enhanced mode, and only when no input/output operations are being performed,
thereby impacting performance and preventing many applications written for
previous versions of Windows from executing. OS/2 Version 2.0 has no such
restriction.
<P>
As with DOS applications, Windows applications may make use of EMS and XMS
memory extenders in order to access memory above 640 KB.  This support is
provided in an identical manner to that provided for DOS applications.
<P>
Support for Microsoft Windows applications under OS/2 Version 2.0 is discussed
in more detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I>.
