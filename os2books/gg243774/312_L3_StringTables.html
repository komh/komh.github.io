<H1>String Tables</H1><!-- entering slot 345 -->
<P>
Tables of text strings may be defined within a resource script file for
use by an application.  A string table is defined using the STRINGTABLE
keyword, as shown in <A HREF="075_L2_StringTableResourceD.html">Figure "String
Table Resource Definition"</A>.
<P>
String tables may be used to contain titles, messages and other common text
used by an application.  The external definition of these strings makes
it easy to change a title or message without modifying source code.  String
tables may also be used to contain menu bar or pulldown menu text for dynamic
insertion by an application.  Special characters such as mnemonic indicators
and tab characters for columnating display may be incorporated into the
string definition.
<P>
The symbolic name following the STRINGTABLE keyword identifies the string
table and is used as a parameter when loading strings from the resource
into application buffers using the<B> WinLoadString()</B> function.  The
PRELOAD keyword specifies that the resource will be incorporated into the
application's main .EXE file, and is to be loaded into memory immediately
rather than being loaded when called by the application.
<P>
Multiple string tables may be defined by an application.  Each string table
must have its own symbolic name (note that the same name may be used for
a string table and another type of resource such as a menu bar) and is enclosed
within the BEGIN and END keywords of a STRINGTABLE statement. Each string
has its own symbolic name within the string table.
<P>
As mentioned above, strings are loaded from the string table into application
buffers using the<B> WinLoadString()</B> function.  For example, to load
the string STR_MAINTITLE from the string table MAIN into a buffer named
szTitle, the function shown in <A HREF="076_L2_LoadingaTextStringRe.html">Figure
"Loading a Text String Resource"</A> is used.
<P>
The<B> WinLoadString()</B> function returns an unsigned integer representing
the number of characters loaded into the target buffer.  Once loaded, the
buffer may then be manipulated using standard programming language functions,
or used as a parameter to other Presentation Manager function calls.
