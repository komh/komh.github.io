dynamic linking
<P>
Process under OS/2, whereby resolution of external references within an
application to modules in dynamic link libraries (DLLs) is deferred until
load time or run time.  This allows modification of modules contained in
DLLs without the need to link-edit an application once more.  Since DLLs
are normally written as reentrant code, dynamic linking also allows multiple
applications to use the same copy of a DLL in memory, thus reducing the
storage requirements of OS/2 applications.
