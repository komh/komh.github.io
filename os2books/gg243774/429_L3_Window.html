In order to narrow down the location of the problem, it is first necessary
to identify the window that was active when the error occurred.  This is
usually self-evident when the window is a display window, but may be less
so if the window is an object window.  However, an object window is activated
upon receiving a message that typically originates from a display window,
and therefore the problem may be effectively tracked down by beginning the
search with the display window.
<P>
The first step is therefore to determine the display window with which the
user was interacting when the error occurred.  For documentation purposes,
the window's title may be used to identify the window.

Identification of the active window allows the search for the problem to
be focused on the window procedure for that window.  It is likely that the
problem lies within that window procedure or a subroutine invoked from that
window procedure.  If not, the active window usually passes a message to
another window which in turn causes the problem; this may be determined
in the isolation phase (see <A HREF="432_L2_ProblemIsolation.html">Problem
Isolation</A>).
