<H1>Instance Data and Window Words</H1><!-- entering slot 265 -->
<P>
For data that is private to a particular instance of a window class, each
window may have an area of storage associated with it, assigned by Presentation
Manager and located within the Presentation Manager control block for that
 window.  This area is known as the <A HREF="713_L2_windowwords.html"><B>window
words</B></A>. The amount of space allocated for window words in a particular
window class is variable, and is defined in the<B> WinRegisterClass()</B> function
call at the time the class is registered to Presentation Manager.
<P>
It is recommended that for storage of amounts of data larger than four bytes,
a memory object is obtained from the operating system using  the<B> DosAllocMem()
</B>or<B> DosSubAlloc()</B> functions, and a pointer to this object is placed
in the window words of the associated window.  An example of this technique
is given in <A HREF="027_L2_StoringInstanceDatai.html">Figure "Storing Instance
Data in Window Words"</A>.
<P>
A memory object corresponding to the size of the data structure MYSTRUCT
is obtained from the operating system using the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function,
and a pointer to this memory object is set by the application. This pointer
is then placed in the window words of the current window's parent (that
is, the frame window) using the<B> WinSetWindowULong()</B> function, at
offset QWL_USER.  A number of predefined Presentation Manager window classes,
including the frame window class, contain a 32-bit word at this offset,
which is available for application use.
<P>
Note the use of the PAG_COMMIT flag in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function
call. This flag causes storage to be allocated immediately for the memory
object being created, since OS/2 Version 2.0 by default uses a two-phase
process for dynamic memory allocation.
<P>
The concept of committing memory is new to Version 2.0, and allows a storage
map for the application to be defined, but the storage is not reserved in
memory until it is needed, at which time the application may explicitly
commit the storage using the<B> DosSetMem()</B> function.  Optionally, the
application may set the PAG_COMMIT flag in the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function
call to commit the storage immediately upon allocation.
<P>
Failure to commit storage, either by use of the PAG_COMMIT flag or the<B> DosSetMem()
</B>function, will result in a page fault exception (Trap 000E) when the
application attempts to write to the storage area.  The concept of allocating
and committing storage is explained fully in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume
1:  Control Program</I>, and the use of these techniques by applications
is described in <A HREF="227_L1_TheFlatMemoryModel.html">The Flat Memory
Model</A>.
<P>
After the memory object containing instance data is initially allocated,
the window procedure may access it during processing of subsequent messages
by issuing a<B> WinQueryWindowULong()</B> call to Presentation Manager,
as shown in <A HREF="028_L2_RetrievingInstanceDa.html">Figure "Retrieving
Instance Data from Window Words"</A>.
<P>
Upon termination of the window by the application, the window procedure
receives a WM_DESTROY message.  As described in <A HREF="246_L3_WindowClosure.html">Window
Closure</A> , the window procedure should process this message by releasing
any resources to which it has access.  This includes the instance data control
block, which must be released using the<B> DosFreeMem()</B> function as
shown in <A HREF="029_L2_ReleasingInstanceDat.html">Figure "Releasing Instance
Data Storage"</A>.
<P>
In the above example, the pointer to the instance data control block is
first retrieved from the window words, giving access to the handles of any
data objects or Presentation Manager resources obtained by the window, in
order that these may be released.  Once this has been achieved, the memory
object containing the control block is released by the window procedure.
 Failure to release the data objects and resources before freeing the memory
object would result in a general protection exception (Trap 000D) when the
data objects or resources were subsequently released.
