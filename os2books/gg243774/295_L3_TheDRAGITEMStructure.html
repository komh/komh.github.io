<H1>The DRAGITEM Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 324 -->
<P>
The DRAGITEM structure contains information about an individual dragitem.
A drag operation may include one or more dragitems, and a separate DRAGITEM
structure is used for each.  The number of dragitems, and an array of pointers
to the DRAGITEM structures, is contained in the DRAGINFO structure.  In
conjunction with the information contained in the DRAGINFO structure, the
DRAGITEM structure provides the information required by a potential or actual
target window, to determine whether a drop operation is valid for the dragitem.

<P>
Several of the fields in the DRAGITEM structure are defined as being of
type HSTR.  These fields refer to ordinary null-terminated character strings
that are given string handles by Presentation Manager when the<B> DrgAddStrHandle()
</B>function is called.  It is the string handles that are stored in the
DRAGITEM structure; the strings themselves are stored by Presentation Manager
and may be accessed by any other process that has access to the string handle,
using the<B> DrgQueryStrName()</B> function.
<P>
For Presentation Manager windows, the DRAGITEM structure is normally allocated
by the source of the drag/drop operation as a local variable, since it only
persists for the duration of the operation.  For Workplace Shell objects,
the structure is allocated by the Workplace Shell and a pointer to it is
passed to the object by the Workplace Shell when it invokes the object's
<I>_wpFormatDragItem</I> method when the drag is initiated.
<P>
A number of fields in the DRAGITEM structure are of primary importance;
these fields are described in the following sections.
<P>
<B>lItemID</B>
<P>
This field contains a value provided by the source window, which uniquely
identifies the dragitem.  For example, the value might be a listbox index
value, a customer number, or any other value that is unique and meaningful
to the source window.  The reason for having this identification is that
later in the drag/drop processing, the target window may need to ask the
source window for more information about the dragged item.  The identifier
can then be used to identify the item concerned.
<P>
<B>hstrType and hstrRMF</B>
<P>
These values refer to character strings containing details of the type of
data represented by the dragitem, and the rendering mechanisms and formats
that the source is able support for the item.  The types correspond to the
<I>file type</I> extended attribute, and are identified by names of the
form DRT_xxxx; for example, DRT_TEXT for plain text, or DRT_BITMAP for bitmap
data.
<P>
The rendering mechanism is specified in the<I> hstrRMF</I> field, and may
refer to any of the standard mechanisms described in <A HREF="292_L3_RenderingMechanisms.html">Rendering
Mechanisms</A>, identified by the names DRM_PRINT, DRM_DISCARD, DRM_OS2FILE
and DRM_DDE, or to any user-defined rendering mechanism for which a similar
name should be defined.  More than one rendering mechanism can be specified;
for example, a program that allows the dragging of files may allow the file
to be moved or copied to another directory, or to be printed by being dropped
on a printer object.  In this case the program would include the names of
both the Print and OS/2 File rendering mechanisms in its hstrRMF string,
allowing the target window to decide which is more suitable.
<P>
The format specifications, which are also contained in the<I> hstrRMF</I> field,
inform a target window of the data formats supported by the dragitem for
each of its supported rendering mechanisms.  Data format names use the convention
DRF_xxxx.
<P>
To illustrate the use of format specifications and rendering mechanisms,
consider a spreadsheet program that allows the user to drag an icon representing
a particular spreadsheet; the user may choose to drag the data into a word-processor,
into another spreadsheet, or onto a printer object for printing. For dragging
the file to another spreadsheet or to a word-processing document, the DRM_OS2FILE
rendering mechanism is<!-- entering slot 325 --> appropriate but for dragging
to a printer object, the DRM_PRINT mechanism is required.  In the case where
the target is the printer or the word-processing document, clearly the required
format for the data is text, but in the case of a drag to another spreadsheet
it would be more convenient to have the numerical data and the cell relationships
transferred too, so a different data format should be used, perhaps SYLK.

<P>
The dragitem therefore needs to indicate that it supports the following
rendering mechanism/data format combinations:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DRM_OS2FILE with DRF_TEXT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DRM_PRINT with DRF_TEXT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DRM_OS2FILE with DRF_SYLK.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The<I> hstrRMF</I> string provides a syntax for defining this in a fairly
straightforward way.  Complete details are given in the<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming
Guide Volume II</I> but, for the above example, the<I> hstrRMF</I> string
is as follows:
<PRE>&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,DRF_TEXT&gt;,&lt;DRM_PRINT,DRF_TEXT&gt;,&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,DRF_SYLK&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This can be expressed slightly more concisely as:
<PRE>(DRM_OS2FILE,DRM_PRINT)x(DRF_TEXT),&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,DRF_SYLK&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Here the first two bracketed items, connected with an "x", indicate that
all possible pairs made up of one from the first bracket and one from the
second, are implied.  This notation is very useful in more complex examples,
where it can save the programmer from having to enumerate all possible combinations
in the string.
<P>
<B>hstrContainerName, hstrSourceName, hstrTargetName</B>
<P>
The meaning of these three fields depends on the rendering mechanism to
be used; with some rendering mechanisms, certain fields are not needed.
 They apply most directly to the DRM_OS2FILE mechanism where they are used
to define the source directory, source file name, and a suggested target
filename (which may be overridden by the target window if it so chooses).
