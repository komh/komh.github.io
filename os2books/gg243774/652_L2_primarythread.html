primary thread
<P>
The first thread of execution created by an OS/2 application upon application
startup.  In a Presentation Manager application, the primary thread typically
provides processing for user interaction and short-lived application functions.
 Lengthy processing is typically carried out by a secondary thread, to preserve
user responsiveness goals as defined in Common User Access guidelines.
