<H1>Object-Oriented vs Functional Decomposition</H1><!-- entering slot 199 -->
<P>
Under a traditional <A HREF="577_L2_functionaldecomposit.html"><B>functional
decomposition</B></A> approach to program design, often referred to as <A HREF="689_L2_structuredprogrammin.html"><B>structured
programming</B></A>, the function or procedure is the unit of modularity;
programs are designed and implemented by placing a number of well-defined
procedures in a particular order, and executing these procedures to achieve
a desired result.  The focus of the design is the procedure or action to
be performed.  Objects such as data structures are attached to procedures
and passed between them using parameters.  A user typically selects an action
to be performed, and then selects or enters a data object upon which to
perform that action.

Decomposition Approach"</A>
<P>
The functional decomposition approach is best suited to situations where
the procedure is necessarily the focus of the application (for instance,
a process management application), and where the correct sequencing of operations
to be performed is a crucial factor in the successful execution of the required
task.  Under this approach, the application defines the sequence of actions
which the user performs;  that is, the application controls the user interface.

<P>
In an object-oriented approach, the application object is the unit of modularity.
 Application objects communicate with each other and pass messages containing
actions to be performed.  Object-oriented programming is hence the conceptual
inverse of functional decomposition, and is a logical extension of the industry
trend toward data-centric application design.
<P>

Approach"</A>
<P>
This is not to say that an object-oriented application should not be structured.
 Although such an application consists of objects that are largely independent
of one another in programming terms, normal structured coding techniques
should be followed in the creation of the methods within each application
object.
<P>
The object-oriented approach also requires firm management of the application
development process in order to achieve the greatest possible level of productivity
through code reuse.  Administration and control of existing objects is vital
in order to allow application developers to access and use these objects
in their applications.  Management of the application development process
is discussed in greater detail in <A HREF="448_L1_ManagingDevelopment.html">Managing
Development</A>, and the structuring of application source modules in order
to provide optimal granularity is described in <A HREF="464_L1_ApplicationProgramCo.html">Application
Program Construction</A>.
<P>
While it is possible for an application designed according to functional
decomposition principles to implement some of the characteristics of object-oriented
applications such as message passing, such applications should not be regarded
as truly object-oriented.  If the design approach centers on procedures
rather than data objects, then the application is designed along functional
decomposition guidelines.  In this case, message passing is merely a replacement
of the normal subroutine call mechanism, and does not significantly affect
the structure of the application.
