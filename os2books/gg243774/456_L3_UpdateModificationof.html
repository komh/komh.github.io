<H1>Update/Modification of Resources</H1><!-- entering slot 499 -->
<P>
When an application developer wishes to make a modification to an application's
resources, those resources should be copied from the production library
to the developer's local work directory.  This is known as <A HREF="556_L2_drawdown.html"><B>drawdown</B></A>,
and must be recorded, including the date, time, the identity of the developer
and the name of the module being copied.  This recording process is known
as <A HREF="517_L2_checkout.html"><B>checkout</B></A>.  Only one developer
at any time must be allowed to check out and draw down a particular module,
in order to avoid the problems inherent in the well-known simultaneous update
situation. Control over checkouts may be achieved in a number of ways.  However,
it is recommended that the drawdown process be achieved by way of a simple
utility application that performs the following steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Accesses a central database that contains the
name of each application resource under development, and determines whether
that resource is currently checked out.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If the resource has been checked out, the utility
application returns the identity of the developer by whom the resource has
been checked out<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If the resource has not been checked out, the
utility application performs a checkout operation, recording the identity
of the application developer and that of the application resource in the
central database, and draws down the application resource into the developer's
local work directory, ready for modification.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When modification of a resource is complete and the resource has been adequately
tested, the user level version should be passed to the resource's owner
who, after determining that appropriate testing has been satisfactorily
carried out, should then promote the new version to production level, ready
for access by other developers.
<P>
When a user level version of an application resource is consigned to the
resource owner, that version must be deleted from the developer's local
work directory, in order to ensure that only the latest production level
version is accessed by the compiler or link editor during the next build.
This operation may be automated as part of the promotion process, or may
be left as an explicit task for the developer.
