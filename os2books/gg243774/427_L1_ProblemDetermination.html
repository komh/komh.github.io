<P>
The steps required for identification and resolution of application errors
and "bugs" in the Presentation Manager application environment are basically
similar to those required for conventional programming environments.  However,
the event-driven nature of the Presentation Manager application model often
causes unnecessary confusion when developers attempt to test and debug their
applications.  This chapter describes a simple approach to problem determination
and resolution under Presentation Manager, which will help in locating and
removing the majority of application problems.
<P>
Successful problem determination in the Presentation Manager environment,
as in any programming environment, requires some basic ingredients:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Effective problem documentation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A methodical approach to problem resolution<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Knowledge and experience of the application environment
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A symbolic debugging tool such as CodeView or Multiscope**
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A measure of luck (!)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When these requirements are satisfied, problem determination may proceed
through the following three phases:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Documentation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Isolation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Diagnosis and resolution.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The remainder of this chapter describes each of these phases in detail,
discussing each step in the resolution process, and also describes the symptoms
and likely solutions for some common application problems.
