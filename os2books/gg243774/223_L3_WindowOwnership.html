<H1>Window Ownership</H1><!-- entering slot 238 -->
<P>
A window may have an<I> owner</I> as well as having a parent.  While a window's
relationship to its parent is mainly concerned with display, the relationship
with its owner is concerned primarily with function.  The owner is assumed
to have some interest in events that take place within a window.  For example,
a frame window is the parent of its frame control windows (icons, menu bar,
etc.,) and is also their owner.  When certain events take place, such as
the user selecting an item from a menu bar, the control windows notify their
owner by dispatching notification messages (the menu bar for instance, typically
dispatches a message of class WM_COMMAND).  Thus the owner receives notification
of the event, and may perform some action in response.
<P>
The concept of ownership is usually applied to system-defined window classes
such as control windows.  Since the window procedures for these window classes
are defined by Presentation Manager rather than by the application, it is
necessary for a control window to notify its owner of any event that may
be significant to the owner.
<P>
There is typically no owner relationship between frame and client windows.
Messages received by the frame window that are deemed to be of possible
interest to the client window are passed to the client window automatically
by the system-supplied frame window procedure, by virtue of the predefined
parent/child relationship between the frame and client windows.
<P>
Should application requirements dictate, the application developer may establish
an owner relationship between any two windows within his/her application,
provided those windows are created by the same thread.  Owner relationships
are not permitted between windows created by different threads.
