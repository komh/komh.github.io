<H1>Application-Initiated Communication</H1><!-- entering slot 315 -->
<P>
In the former case, the communication is quite simple since the initiator
of the communication typically has knowledge of the type of object to which
the communication is being passed, and can usually initiate the communication
by simply invoking a method in the receiving object, in a similar manner
to that discussed in <A HREF="271_L3_Methods.html">Methods (Invoking Another
Object's Methods)</A>.
<P>
However, it is often necessary to determine the identity of the object for
which a method must be invoked.  The Workplace Shell provides access to
objects using the HOBJECT and the OBJECTID and, at a base level, system
object model provides pointers to objects and SOM IDs.  Each of these is
described in the following sections, and some discussion is included on
converting between identifiers.
<P>
<B>HOBJECT</B>
<P>
This identifier is the object handle, which is allocated by the Workplace
Shell and passed as the return value from the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> function.
 It is a persistent object handle that remains allocated to an object for
the duration of its existence.  Object handles persist across system restarts,
and may therefore be used by one object to refer to another object at any
time.
<P>
An object handle can be determined from the object's OBJECTID using the
<B>WinQueryObject()</B> function, as follows:
<PRE>HOBJECT  hObject;                            /* Object handle         */
PSZ      szObjectID = "&lt;OBJECTID&gt;";          /* OBJECTID string       */

hObject = WinQueryObject(szObjectID);        /* Query object handle   */
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this function may be called from any process; its use is not restricted
to objects in the Workplace Shell process.
<P>
<B>OBJECTID</B>
<P>
The OBJECTID is provided by an application or object class as part of the
setup string parameter in the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> call, when an object
is created.  It is persistent in the same way as an object handle, but provides
a more meaningful reference for an object, which can be used by other objects.

<P>
<A HREF="068_L2_ReferencinganObjectU.html">Figure "Referencing an Object
Using OBJECTID"</A>
<P>
Note that the angle brackets ("&lt;" and "&gt;") used within the OBJECTID
are an important part of the syntax.
<P>
Note also that the Workplace Shell provides a number of predefined OBJECTIDs
for system-defined objects.  The first and third<B> WinCreateObject()</B> calls
in <A HREF="068_L2_ReferencinganObjectU.html">Figure "Referencing an Object
Using OBJECTID"</A> use the &lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt; OBJECTID to place the objects
on the desktop.
<P>
<B>SOM Pointer</B>
<P>
SOM pointers come in various forms, but can all be typecast to<I> SOMAny
*</I>.  From a Workplace Shell perspective, a SOM pointer is the return
value of the<I> _wpclsNew</I> class method; this is the method used for
creating objects within the Workplace Shell process.  An object's public
methods and data can be accessed using the object's SOM pointer.
<P>
A SOM pointer for an object may be obtained from an object handle using
the<I> _wpclsQueryObject</I> method provided by the<I> WPObject</I> class,
as follows:
<PRE>SOMAny *Asomptr;                             /* SOM pointers          */
SOMAny *Bsomptr;

Asomptr = _wpclsQueryObject(_WPObject,       /* Query SOM pointer     */
                            hObject);        /* Object handle         */
</PRE>

<P>
A SOM pointer for a class may be obtained from the SOM ID for that class,
using the<I> _somFindClass</I> method shown below:
<PRE>Asomptr = _somFindClass(SOMClassMgrObject,
                        AsomId,
                        1,
                        1);
</PRE>

<P>
A SOM pointer for a class may be obtained from the SOM pointer for any object
within that class, using the<I> _somGetClass</I> method as follows:
<PRE>Asomptr = _somGetClass(Bsomptr);
</PRE>

<P>
The SOM pointer is typically used to invoke class methods from an object
in another class.  The<I> _SOMDispatchL()</I> method shown in <A HREF="050_L2_InvokingaMethodinAno.html">Figure
"Invoking a Method in Another Object Class"</A> requires a SOM pointer as
a parameter.
<P>
<B>SOM ID</B>
<P>
A SOM ID is simply a way of mapping a unique number to a string.  This string
may represent the name of a method or class.  SOM IDs are integers that
are managed by the Workplace Shell using the Atom Manager facility of Presentation
Manager.  A SOM ID is obtained using the<B> SOM_IdFromString()</B> function
as follows:
<PRE>somId    AsomId;

AsomId = SOM_IdFromString("WPFolder");
</PRE>

<P>
The SOM ID is typically used to obtain a SOM pointer, which can then be
used to invoke a method.
