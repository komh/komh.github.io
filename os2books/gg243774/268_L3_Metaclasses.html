<P>
Just as each Workplace Shell object is an instance of a class, the class
itself is an instance of another class known as its <A HREF="617_L2_metaclass.html"><B>metaclass</B></A>.
Just as an object has instance data and methods that pertain only to a specific
instance of the class, so the metaclass has class data and methods that
pertain to the<I> entire</I> class.  Such methods are known as<B> class
methods</B>, whereas methods that operate only for a particular instance
of the class are known as<B> instance methods</B>.
<P>
Class methods and data are available to the programmer when creating new
object classes.  A programmer may introduce new class data and methods for
an object class, as well as instance data and methods.  Similarly, a new
object class may override existing class methods to modify the processing
performed by those methods.
