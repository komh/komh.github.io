<P>
Under OS/2 Version 1.3, the Presentation Manager provides a basis for the
implementation of object-oriented software engineering principles, allowing
the developer to take advantage of the benefits inherent in the object-oriented
approach. However, the Presentation Manager application model lacks a built-in
inheritance hierarchy, and therefore prevents the developer from realizing
the productivity and consistency benefits that may be achieved under the
principle of inheritance.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 extends the object-based Presentation Manager user interface
with the introduction of the <A HREF="716_L2_WorkplaceShell.html"><B>Workplace
Shell</B></A>*, and also provides an object-oriented application model that
allows applications to exploit the principle of inheritance. The Workplace
Shell application model views an application as a series of objects, typically
represented by icons on the Workplace Shell desktop, which are manipulated
by the user to achieve the required result.
<P>
Objects may represent entities such as files, programs or devices, or may
be containers that allow the user to logically group related objects.  The
properties or contents of an object may be examined using a <A HREF="706_L2_view.html"><B>view
</B></A>of the object, which is typically implemented as a Presentation
Manager window.
<P>
The Workplace Shell application model is based upon the <A HREF="694_L2_systemobjectmodel.html"><B>system
object model</B></A>, which defines a set of classes to form a basic inheritance
hierarchy, and a set of protocols for interaction between application objects.
 The Workplace Shell defines its own object classes that extend the inheritance
hierarchy, and an application developer can continue to extend the hierarchy,
subclassing existing object classes to create new classes.
<P>
The Workplace Shell therefore brings both the end user and the application
developer closer to the concept of direct object manipulation, and allows
exploitation of the class-based theory of object-oriented programming.  The
Workplace Shell application model, along with the creation and manipulation
of Workplace Shell objects, is described in detail in <A HREF="265_L1_WorkplaceShellandthe.html">Workplace
Shell and the System Object Model</A>.
