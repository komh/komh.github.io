<H1>32-Bit Interface Constraints</H1><!-- entering slot 410 -->
<P>
The following subsystems, present in OS/2 Version 1.3, have no 32-bit equivalents,
since they are not portable and are device-dependent.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>VIO</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL> Video subsystem; these function calls
should be replaced with Presentation Manager GPI calls or AVIO (advanced
video) calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> KBD</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL> Keyboard
subsystem; these function calls should be replaced by processing WM_CHAR
messages from a Presentation Manager application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> MOU
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL>Mouse subsystem; these function calls should
be replaced by processing WM_MOUSEMOVE and WM_BUTTON messages.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> MON
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL>Device monitor subsystem; these function calls
should be replaced by using appropriate message queue hooks in a Presentation
Manager application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that these subsystems are supported under OS/2 Version 2.0 as 16-bit
service layers, for access by existing applications.  However, OS/2 Version
2.0 does not provide thunk layers to enable 32-bit applications to access
these service layers.  32-bit applications that use these subsystems must
employ mixed model programming techniques to access the 16-bit services;
see <A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing 16-Bit and 32-Bit
Application Modules</A> for further discussion.
<P>
Only two forms of input/output are supported in the 32-bit environment;
the<I> stdin/stdout</I> C interface (producing command line-based applications
that can be run in a text window) and Presentation Manager applications.
 Programs wishing to perform graphics, handle keyboard or mouse input, or
intercept and modify device information should do so using Presentation
Manager functions.
<P>
Certain other functions have also been removed from the 32-bit programming
interface.  These are primarily concerned with the management of memory
in the segmented memory model.  Therefore functions such as<B> DosSizeSeg()</B>,
<B>DosLockSeg()</B> and<B> DosUnlockSeg()</B>,<B> DosR2StackRealloc()</B> etc
are not implemented in the 32-bit programming interface, although the 16-bit
entry points are still supported for compatibility purposes.
