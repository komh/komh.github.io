<H1>Workplace Shell and the System Object Model</H1><!-- entering slot 285 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell provided under OS/2 Version 2.0 introduces an object-oriented
layer into the Presentation Manager environment.  It provides a mechanism
for the registration of object classes, creation of objects within those
classes, and the inheritance of characteristics and behaviors from existing
object classes.  Using the Workplace Shell, an application may be created
as a series of objects that interact on the desktop, and which the user
manipulates to perform the required application processing.  Each object
possesses data, which may be defined for the entire class or for each instance,
and a set of methods that operate upon that data.
<P>
The Workplace Shell functions that allow the creation and manipulation of
objects are based upon the <A HREF="694_L2_systemobjectmodel.html"><B>system
object model</B></A>, which establishes a basic inheritance hierarchy for
objects in the system and defines the underlying protocols which regulate
the relationships between objects.  The concepts behind the system object
model are described in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation
Manager and Workplace Shell</I>.
