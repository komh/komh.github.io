<H1>DOS Application Support</H1><!-- entering slot 191 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 1.3 provides the capability for a single DOS application to
be executed in the system using a facility known as the <A HREF="552_L2_DOSCompatibilityBox.html"><B>DOS
Compatibility Box</B></A>. The DOS application executes in real mode, and
is automatically suspended if the DOS Compatibility Box is switched to the
background; that is, pre-emptive multitasking is not supported in the DOS
Compatibility Box under OS/2 Version 1.3.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability to pre-emptively multitask DOS
applications along with OS/2 applications, using the <A HREF="624_L2_MultipleVirtualDOSMa.html"><B>Multiple
Virtual DOS Machines</B></A> feature of OS/2 Version 2.0.  The DOS support
has been totally rewritten in OS/2 Version 2.0  and allows multiple concurrent
DOS applications where each is executed as a single-threaded, protected
mode OS/2 program.  This method of implementation provides pre-emptive multitasking
for DOS applications, and allows normal OS/2 levels of memory protection;
that is, it provides isolation of system memory and other applications,
protection from illegal memory accesses by ill-behaved applications, and
the ability to terminate sessions where applications are "hung".
<P>
DOS support is achieved through the use of virtualization techniques, allowing
the creation of multiple instances of separate, independent virtual DOS
machines. Through this technique, a virtual interface is provided to each
DOS machine, giving the impression that each application owns all of the
required resources, both hardware and software.
<P>
Each virtual DOS machine has more memory than the DOS Compatability Box
implemented in previous versions of OS/2, and OS/2 Version 2.0 supports
the use of Lotus**-Intel-Microsoft (LIM) expanded memory (EMS) and extended
memory (XMS) to provide additional memory for those DOS applications that
are capable of using such extensions.  OS/2 Version 2.0 maps this extended
or expanded memory into the system's normal linear memory address space,
and manages it in the same manner as any other allocated memory.
<P>
The ability of a virtual DOS machine to run within a Presentation Manager
window provides immediate productivity gains to existing DOS applications,
since they may utilize Presentation Manager desktop features.  These features
include window manipulation and the ability to cut/copy/paste information
between applications using the clipboard.
<P>
Application compatibility in the virtual DOS machine is also enhanced over
previous versions of OS/2.  The virtual DOS machine can be used to execute
DOS-based communications applications and other applications that address
hardware I/O devices, through the use of virtual device drivers that map
the device driver calls from the applications to the appropriate physical
device driver within the operating system.  Applications using hardware
devices that are not required to be shared with other applications in the
same system may be accessed using the standard DOS device drivers, without
the need for a virtual device driver.  Certain restrictions still apply
with respect to communications line speed and time-critical interrupt handling.

<P>
For applications that require specific versions of DOS in order to operate,
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability to load a physical copy of that
version into a virtual DOS machine.  This provides compatability for those
applications that internally manipulate DOS data structures or that use
undocumented interfaces.
<P>
Application compatability in a virtual DOS machine is further enhanced by
the <A HREF="553_L2_DOSsettings.html"><B>DOS settings</B></A> feature, which
allows virtual DOS machines to be customized to suit the requirements of
the applications running in them.  Properties such as video characteristics,
hardware<!-- entering slot 192 --> environment emulation, and the use of
memory extenders can all be customized using this feature.
<P>
Multiple Virtual DOS Machines is described in more detail in<I> OS/2 Version
2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I>.
