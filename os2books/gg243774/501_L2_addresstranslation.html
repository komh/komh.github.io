address translation
<P>
<B>(1)</B> The process of resolving a 0:32 memory reference into a physical
memory address.  When using the paged memory option in the 80386 processor,
a memory pointer passed by an application consists of Page Directory and
Page Table entries, and an offset within a physical page.  This is resolved
by the processor into a 32-bit physical memory address.  The validity and
legality of the memory reference is also checked during the translation
process, and a general protection exception is generated if necessary. <B> (2)
</B>The process of resolving a 16:16 memory reference into a physical memory
address using a process's local descriptor table.  The validity and legality
of the memory reference is also checked during the translation process,
and a general protection exception is generated if necessary.
