<P>
Having defined the data objects and their relationships, the set of actions
pertaining to each data object should be determined. Once this point is
achieved, the high-level design of the application objects, and therefore
of the application itself, is essentially complete, and should be documented
and approved by all concerned parties before the detailed design of methods
commences.  Note that it is not necessary to define<I> all</I> of the applicable
actions for each data object, since the essentially independent nature of
methods allows additional actions to be added to an application object.
