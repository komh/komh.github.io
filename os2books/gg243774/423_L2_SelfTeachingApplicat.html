<P>
An extension of the tutorial concept is possible, where the user invokes
an online procedure manual that describes a business process; hypertext
and hypergraphic links can be imbedded in this manual to start the application
or applications that support the business process.  This can be performed
in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where the steps in the business process are largely
independent of one another, a separate application may be used for each
step.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where the steps are interdependent, a single application
can be used, with links triggering application events by way of messages.
