<H1>Destroying a Secondary Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 362 -->
<P>
Secondary threads should be terminated when they are no longer required,
to reduce the context-switching  overhead of the operating system.  The
method of termination depends  upon how the secondary thread was created,
and whether or not it has  created object windows.
