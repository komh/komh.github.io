direct manipulation
<P>
User interface technique whereby application functions are initiated by
the user manipulating objects, represented by icons, on the Presentation
Manager or Workplace Shell desktop.  The user typically initiates an action
by selecting an icon, pressing and holding down a mouse button while "dragging"
the icon over another object's icon on the desktop.  The user then "drops"
the icon over the target object by releasing the mouse button.  For this
reason, the technique is also known as "drag and drop" manipulation.
