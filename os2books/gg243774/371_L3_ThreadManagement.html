<P>
The<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function has been enhanced in OS/2 Version
2.0 to facilitate the creation of secondary threads.  Under previous versions
of OS/2, an application was required to explicitly allocate a memory segment
for the stack to be used by a secondary thread.  Under OS/2 Version 2.0
however, stack allocation is performed as a built-in part of the<B> DosCreateThread()
</B>function, and deallocation is performed automatically by the operating
system upon termination of a thread.
<P>
Applications that use the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function should be modified
to use the new form of the function call, as shown in <A HREF="111_L2_DosCreateThreadFunct.html">Figure
"DosCreateThread() Function"</A>.
<P>
Note that the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function under OS/2 Version 2.0 also
allows parameters to be passed to the thread as part of the<B> DosCreateThread()
</B>function.  The third parameter to the function is a 32-bit pointer,
which may be used to pass the address of an application-defined data structure
containing the required parameter data.
<P>
The<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function and its implementation under OS/2
Version 2.0 are described in greater detail in<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Control
Program Reference</I>.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also allows an application to forcibly terminate a thread
using the<B> DosKillThread()</B> function. This function allows an application's
primary thread to terminate any secondary threads prior to its own shutdown,
in a more elegant manner than was possible under previous versions of OS/2.
