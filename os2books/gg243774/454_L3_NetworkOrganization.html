<H1>Network Organization</H1><!-- entering slot 497 -->
<P>
The topology of a local area network is very much determined by the structure
of the development organization, and by the size and nature of the projects
undertaken by that organization.  The techniques of LAN installation, configuration
and management are beyond the scope of this document.  However, it is possible
to formulate some simple guidelines which facilitate management of the development
process.
<P>
Local area networks are typically divided into logical partitions known
as <A HREF="549_L2_domain.html"><B>domains</B></A>. A domain is defined
as a logical subgroup of a network, which contains a defined group of network
nodes (machines), a defined set of network resources such as shared disks,
directories and printers, and a defined set of authorized users.  Each domain
thus forms a logical network in its own right, and multiple domains may
exist on a single physical network.  A domain may include resources residing
on multiple network server nodes, and multiple domains may access the resources
of any particular server.  Each user on the network is provided with a unique
user ID and password.  An application developer may be defined as an authorized
user of multiple domains within the same physical network; the same or different
user IDs and passwords may be used. <A HREF="136_L2_NetworkDomains.html">Figure
"Network Domains"</A> illustrates a network with three domains, each containing
a number of network nodes.  Each domain has one or more server nodes (marked
<I>S</I>) upon which reside shared resources accessible by users on other
nodes. Note that the servers may be accessed from within a single domain
or from multiple domains, and that other network nodes may also belong to
multiple domains.  Note also that there is no direct mapping between a network
node and a network user; a user may, in principle, sign on and access server
resources from any network node in the domain.
<P>
Assuming a project-team orientation in the development organization, it
is expedient to logically group the members of a particular project team,
in order that they may be treated as a distinct group and separated from
other project teams for purposes of resource access and administration.

<P>
In the simplest case, a number of project teams in the same physical location
would use the same physical network, partitioned into separate domains for
each project team.  Each domain would possess its own set of production
libraries for application resources; other development resources such as
compilers and generic code libraries, which are common across the entire
development organization, would be stored in a production library on a single
server, and defined within all domains.  This technique provides isolation
of application resources while also allowing common access to other development
resources, and eases the task of maintaining and updating these common resources
since only one copy need exist on the network.
<P>
The principle of one domain per project team is obviously a "rule of thumb"
and must be evaluated in light of the individual development organization.
In the case of very large projects, it may be necessary to subdivide the
project team into manageable subgroups.  This would probably be necessary
purely for managerial purposes, irrespective of whether a LAN were to be
used.  Conversely, very small project teams may not warrant the effort of
establishing a separate domain, and several such small teams may be combined
in a single management unit with a single network domain.
