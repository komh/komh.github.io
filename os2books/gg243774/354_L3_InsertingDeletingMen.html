<H1>Inserting/Deleting Menu Bar Items</H1><!-- entering slot 390 -->
<P>
The insertion of an item is achieved by sending a message of class MM_INSERTITEM
to the system menu (or to the menu bar or appropriate pulldown menu) using
the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()</B> function.  The menu item information is placed
into a data structure of type MENUITEM, as shown in <A HREF="105_L2_DynamicallyInserting.html">Figure
"Dynamically Inserting a Menu Bar Item"</A>.
<P>
In the example shown above, an item is to be inserted into a standard "File"
pulldown menu.  The menu item information is placed  into the data structure
<I>MenuItem</I>, and the text to appear in  the pulldown menu is contained
in the string variable<I> szItemText</I>.
<P>
Note however, that the menu bar is a child of the frame window, and the
pulldown menu is a child of the menu bar.  In order to successfully pass
the message, the handle of the frame window must be obtained, and used to
obtain the handle of the menu bar window.  This  handle is then used in
the<B> WinSendDlgItemMsg()</B> call, along  with the window identifier MN_FILE,
to send the MM_INSERTITEM message  to the pulldown menu.  The frame window
handle is obtained using the <B> WinQueryWindow()</B> function, and the
QW_PARENT attribute causes the function to return the handle of the client's
parent (that is, the frame window).
<P>
Once the frame window's handle is obtained, the various attributes of the
<I>MenuItem</I> structure are initialized.  An MM_INSERTITEM  message is
then sent directly to the pulldown menu.
<P>
Deletion of an item is accomplished in a similar fashion using a message
of class MM_DELETEITEM.  Both message classes and the MENUITEM data structure
are described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.

<P>
<B>Inserting/Deleting Separators</B>
<P>
Where more than one logical group of items is contained within a single
pulldown menu, these groups should be divided by a<I> separator</I>, which
is a horizontal bar appearing between the last item of one group and the
first item of the next, in order to provide a visual indication of the group's
distinct identities.  A separator may be defined within the resource script
file (see <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager
Resources</A>) or may be inserted and deleted dynamically by the application.
This dynamic insertion/deletion is carried out in a similar manner to that
already described for "normal" pulldown menu items.  However, the<I> afStyle
</I>field in the MENUITEM structure is specified as MIS_SEPARATOR, and the
text of the item is set to NULL.  In such  cases, an item identifier is
not required for the separator, although  it is recommended since an identifier
must be specified in order to  delete the separator from the pulldown menu
should this be necessary at  a later time.
<P>
Deletion of a separator is achieved in exactly the same manner as that described
for a normal pulldown menu item, using a message of class MM_DELETEITEM
and specifying the identifier of the separator to be deleted.
<P>
<B>Inserting/Deleting Pulldown Menus</B>
<P>
The technique for dynamically inserting a pulldown menu or cascade pulldown
into the menu bar is basically similar to that already described for inserting
a menu bar or pulldown menu item. An example is given in <A HREF="106_L2_DynamicallyInserting.html">Figure
"Dynamically Inserting a Pulldown Menu"</A>.
<P>
The difference lies in the fact that a pulldown menu or cascade pulldown
requires a menu template to be reserved in memory in order to contain the
items that will subsequently be inserted into the pulldown.  This template
is created using the<B> WinCreateMenu()</B> function, which returns a handle
to the menu template.  This handle is then used in the<I> hwndSubmenu</I> field
of the MENUITEM structure.
