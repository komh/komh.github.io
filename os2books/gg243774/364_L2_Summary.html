<H1>Summary</H1><!-- entering slot 406 -->
<P>
It can be seen that there are emergent programming conventions governing
the use of Presentation Manager and operating system constructs to implement
CUA-conforming, object-oriented applications under the Presentation Manager
application architecture.  These principles facilitate the achievement of
the many benefits attributable to the use of an object-oriented design approach,
while remaining within the framework of Systems Application Architecture.

<P>
Guidelines have been established, in accordance with emerging conventions,
with regard to the use of standard and control windows, dialog boxes and
message boxes, and the nature of their interaction with the user.  Each
type of window has its own particular role in the interaction between the
application and the end user; adherence to these conventions will provide
a greater level of consistency between applications, within the parameters
of the CUA specifications.
<P>
The CUA guidelines specify that an application should have a response time
of no more than 0.1 seconds, after which time the application should be
ready to process the next user interaction.  However, the situation may
arise where a unit of processing takes longer than the allowed time period.
A number of ways exist by which the application may overcome this problem,
typically involving the use of asynchronous threads, either with or without
object windows.
<P>
The embodiment of these principles into Presentation Manager applications
at the design stage results in closer conformance to Systems Application
Architecture guidelines.  The enterprise may thereby achieve the benefits
of a consistent and intuitive approach to the human-machine interface between
users and applications.
