<H1>Timers and Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 380 -->
<P>
Another method of achieving synchronization between threads or  processes
involves the use of an event semaphore and the Presentation Manager timer
 facility. The timer facility may be used from within a window procedure
to create and start a timer that periodically sends messages of class WM_TIMER
to the window, at intervals specified by the window procedure when the timer
is created.
<P>
In this case, the WM_TIMER message is used by the window procedure in the
primary thread or process, to periodically check the state of an event semaphore
that indicates whether the secondary thread or process has completed its
processing.  The secondary thread or process sets the event semaphore upon
commencing its processing, and releases (posts) it upon completion.  The
primary thread or process queries the state of the semaphore to determine
when the secondary thread or process has completed its processing.
<P>
Note that when using this technique for synchronization between  processes
(rather than between threads within the same process), the  event semaphore
must be created as a shared semaphore, either by giving  it a name or by
specifying the DC_SEM_SHARED flag when invoking the <B> DosCreateEventSem()
</B>function.
<P>
An example of a secondary thread using this technique is shown in <A HREF="100_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using an Event Semaphore (Part 1)"</A>.
<P>
Note that the event semaphore is created as a shared semaphore and named.
 A named semaphore is recommended since, if the secondary thread routine
is placed in a  dynamic link library for subsequent use by other applications,
or the  secondary thread executes in a separate process, the name of the
 semaphore may be included in the documentation for that library,  enabling
calling window procedures to access the semaphore using the <B> DosOpenEventSem()
</B>function (see <A HREF="101_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure "Synchronization
Using an Event Semaphore (Part 2)"</A>).  Using this technique promotes
code reusability.
<P>
<A HREF="101_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure "Synchronization Using
an Event Semaphore (Part 2)"</A> shows a window procedure using the <B> WinStartTimer()
</B>function to start a timer, immediately after dispatching a secondary
thread such  as the one shown in <A HREF="100_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure
"Synchronization Using an Event Semaphore (Part 1)"</A>.  This timer in
this example  will cause a WM_TIMER message to be passed to the window every
0.5  seconds (500 milliseconds).
<P>
Since the primary thread or process must remain responsive to the  end user
and thus cannot wait indefinitely for the semaphore to be  released, the
Presentation Manager timer facility is used to generate periodic WM_TIMER
messages to the invoking window procedure in the primary thread or process.
 Upon receipt of each WM_TIMER message, the window procedure checks the
state of the semaphore, timing out immediately if  the semaphore has not
yet been released by the secondary thread or  process.  This technique is
illustrated in <A HREF="101_L2_SynchronizationUsing.html">Figure "Synchronization
Using an Event Semaphore (Part 2)"</A>.
<P>
Note once again the use of a named shared semaphore, in order to  reduce
the level of interdependence between the primary and secondary threads/processes,
thus facilitating the inclusion of the secondary routine into a dynamic
link library for subsequent use by other applications.
