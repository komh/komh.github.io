<P>
It can be seen from the foregoing discussion that Presentation Manager provides
a base that facilitates the implementation of module-based object-oriented
conventions by application programs.  The concepts of an application object
and its methods are implemented under Presentation Manager as a window and
its window procedure.
<P>
Windows are grouped into classes and a window procedure is associated with
a window on the basis of its class, in a parallel to the concept of allocating
methods to an object class rather than to individual instances of that class.
 Window classes are defined in isolation however, and the concept of an
inheritance hierarchy is not imposed by Presentation Manager, thus further
enhancing the potential for efficient reuse by increasing object granularity.
 Presentation Manager allows windows to be subclassed, in order to allow
additional or modified methods to be applied to an object in response to
new or specialized actions.  This provides an additional enhancement to
the capability of code reuse, since it is not necessary to create a new
object class in order to implement small modifications to an existing class.

<P>
Windows communicate with the system and with each other by way of messages,
which are queued and routed by Presentation Manager, and which are processed
in a serial fashion by the target window procedure.  This messaging model
is a practical implementation of the message-driven communication precept
of object-oriented application design.
<P>
While not supported explicitly by Presentation Manager, the object-oriented
concept of encapsulation is supported implicitly by the ability of a window
procedure to define and thus "own" a data object.  The concept of polymorphism
is also supported by Presentation Manager, since the behavior and results
obtained from a window procedure are dependent upon, and only upon the class
and contents of messages sent to that window procedure.  In a similar fashion,
the result of a message is dependent upon the window procedure (application
object) to which it is passed.  The isolation of data objects within an
application object facilitates the containment of change by enhancing application
modularity, thus easing the task of change management and application maintenance.

Correlation"</A>
<P>
The ability to encapsulate the definitions of data objects with the methods
used to manipulate those objects, and to store the resulting application
objects in object libraries, facilitates the notion of reusability, which
is one of the central precepts of object-oriented programming.  The dynamic
linking facilities provided by OS/2 further extend the potential for reusable
application objects.  Reusable objects may be defined and stored for use
by multiple applications;  indeed, multiple objects may direct messages
to a single instance of an object executing in the system.  The message
queueing and serialization provided by Presentation Manager ensures the
correct sequence of processing to preserve the user's intention and facilitate
the integrity of data objects.
<P>
It may be seen that the concept of an application object as defined in <A HREF="187_L1_ObjectOrientedApplic.html">Object-Oriented
Applications</A> and the implementation of a window under Presentation Manager
have a strong correlation.  A window may be regarded as the identity of
an application object.  That object is associated with a data object and
a set of methods (the window procedure) that perform actions upon the data
object.  Class-specific data is defined within the window procedure, while
storage for instance data is defined dynamically and pointers typically
stored in window words.  Windows communicate with the user and with one
another by way of messages.  Thus the window is the implementation of an
application object under Presentation Manager.
<P>
Hence Presentation Manager provides an execution environment and a basic
application architecture that supports the implementation of object-oriented
applications, within the boundaries of IBM Systems Application Architecture.
 Although it does not provide a complete development environment that<!-- entering slot 242 --> enforces
object-oriented guidelines, it offers the basis upon which such a development
environment may be based.
