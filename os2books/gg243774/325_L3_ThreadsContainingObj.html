<H1>Threads Containing Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 358 -->
<P>
In the case where the processing of an event involves access to and manipulation
of another data object, the secondary thread should create its own message
queue and one or more object windows with window procedures to process any
messages passed by the primary thread.  This technique preserves the object-oriented
nature of the application by isolating data objects from one another.
<P>
The primary thread then passes messages to the secondary thread's object
windows, in an identical manner to that used when passing  messages to a
window procedure in the primary thread; it is recommended that this be achieved
using the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> function, since this call allows asynchronous
processing of the message and preserves the correct serialization of messages
in the system, as described in <A HREF="215_L3_WindowProcedures.html">Window
Procedures (Invoking a Window Procedure)</A>.
<P>
Asynchronous threads with object windows are normally created by  window
procedures in the application's primary thread issuing a<B> _beginthread()
</B>function call.  This call is typically made  by a window procedure during
its processing of the WM_CREATE message;  the secondary thread and its object
window (or windows) are then  initialized and able to accept any requests
passed to them.  An example  of the<B> _beginthread()</B> function is shown
in <A HREF="083_L2_CreatingaThreadWitha.html">Figure "Creating a Thread
With an Object Window"</A>.
<P>
Note that when using the IBM C Set/2 compiler, the second parameter in the
<B>_beginthread()</B> function call (the pointer to the stack)  is ignored,
since the<B> _beginthread()</B> function automatically  allocates memory
for the stack. This parameter is included merely to allow source code compatibility
with applications written for the earlier IBM C/2 and Microsoft C compilers,
which required the  application to explicitly allocate stack space for a
secondary thread.  Note that the minimum recommended stack size for a thread
containing object windows is 8192 bytes (8 KB).
<P>
The handle of the window from which the secondary thread is being created
is passed to the thread in the<B> _beginthread()</B> call.  The secondary
thread's main routine may then pass this handle to the object window created
in the thread.  Upon successful creation, the object window can then pass
an acknowledgement message back to the window that created it, containing
the handle of the object window, in order that the calling window may then
post messages to the object window.  This acknowledgement message also ensures
that the object window is correctly created and initialized before any messages
are posted to it.
<P>
The secondary thread's main routine is similar in structure to the main
routine of the primary thread in a Presentation Manager application.  The
main  routine registers the object window class, creates a window of that
 class and enters a message processing loop.
<P>
It should be noted that the secondary thread's main routine is  identical
to that of the application's primary thread, with the  exception that a
secondary thread need not register itself to Presentation Manager, since
this is typically done once per application, by the primary thread.  However,
if certain functions such as error processing are required on a per-thread
basis, a separate anchor block must be created for the secondary thread,
and hence an additional<B> WinInitialize()</B> call must be made.
<P>
<A HREF="084_L2_SecondaryThreadCreat.html">Figure "Secondary Thread Creating
an Object Window"</A> shows a secondary thread that registers an  object
window class and creates a window of that class.
<P>
An object window is created using the normal<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> call,
as illustrated in <A HREF="084_L2_SecondaryThreadCreat.html">Figure "Secondary
Thread Creating an Object Window"</A>.  The window's parent is  specified
as the conceptual object window, the handle of which is obtained from the
<B>WinQueryObjectWindow()</B> function, or using the defined constant HWND_OBJECT.
 Note that the  handle of the window that created the thread is passed to
the object  window in the<I> CtlData</I> parameter of the<B> WinCreateWindow()
</B>call, in order that the object window may pass its handle back to the
calling window to indicate its readiness to receive messages.
<P>
The secondary thread retrieves messages from its input queue in the conventional
manner using<B> WinGetMsg()</B>, and invokes Presentation Manager  using
<B>WinDispatchMsg()</B> to pass the message to its object window procedure.
 Thus a secondary thread has a message processing loop similar to that of
the application's (primary thread's) main routine.
<P>
An object window procedure is identical in structure to a "normal" display
window procedure.  An example of an object window  procedure is illustrated
in <A HREF="085_L2_SampleObjectWindowPr.html">Figure "Sample Object Window
Procedure"</A>.
<P>
Upon creation, an object window receives a WM_CREATE message in the same
way as a standard window.  The window may capture and explicitly process
this message in order to open or create data objects, initialize instance
data, etc., as illustrated in <A HREF="085_L2_SampleObjectWindowPr.html">Figure
"Sample Object Window Procedure"</A>. <!-- entering slot 359 --> Once opened,
however,  an object window typically only receives a number of application-defined
<BR>
messages requesting certain actions on  data objects owned by the window.

<P>
The object window procedure shown in <A HREF="085_L2_SampleObjectWindowPr.html">Figure
"Sample Object Window Procedure"</A>  also extracts the handle of the window
that issued the<B> WinCreateWindow()</B> function call, which is normally
passed to the object window as part of the WM_CREATE message.  The window
procedure then uses this handle to send an acknowledgement message back
to this window, containing its own window handle and thus enabling the two
windows to communicate with one another.  This is necessary when object
windows are created in secondary threads, as described in <A HREF="333_L2_CommunicatingWithaSe.html">Communicating
With a Secondary Thread</A>.  Note that the object window procedure must
use  the<I> system</I> linkage convention; this is achieved using the EXPENTRY
keyword.
<P>
The only other system-defined message class normally received by an  object
window is the WM_DESTROY message class passed to the window by  Presentation
Manager when a<B> WinDestroyWindow()</B> call is issued by the  thread.
 An object window should respond to the WM_DESTROY message by  closing,
destroying or freeing any data objects to which it has  obtained access,
and backing out any uncommitted units of work.
<P>
<A HREF="085_L2_SampleObjectWindowPr.html">Figure "Sample Object Window
Procedure"</A> shows a number of application-defined message  classes being
processed by the object window procedure.  These message  classes are typically
defined by the application during its initialization.  For message classes
that will be processed by an object window procedure loaded from a DLL module,
the message classes should be defined in the include file for that DLL module,
rather than explicitly within the application that uses the DLL module.
 This further enhances the isolation of the internal workings of the object
window from other components of the application, and facilitates reusability
of the code.
<P>
The window procedure in the primary thread must have some way of determining
when the object window has completed its processing, at which point it may
safely assume that the previous event has been processed successfully and
allow the user to continue operating upon  the data object, or take appropriate
error action.  This indication may  be provided in a number of ways, which
are discussed in <A HREF="343_L2_MaintainingSynchroni.html">Maintaining
Synchronization</A>.
