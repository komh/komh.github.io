<P>
For the purpose of discussion, a distinction will be made between subroutines
invoked using normal programming language calling mechanisms, and window
or dialog procedures invoked by Presentation Manager in response to the
application issuing a<B> WinDispatchMsg()</B>,<B> WinPostMsg()</B> or<B> WinSendMsg()
</B>call. Window and dialog procedures are discussed in the following section.

<P>
When examining application code, it is useful to know the type of event
handled or processing carried out by a particular function or subroutine,
without the need for detailed examination of the code for that subroutine.
This capability can be facilitated by the use of a prefix to the function
or subroutine name, which indicates the type of the function or subroutine
to the reader.
<P>
Since the types of functions carried out within applications may be extremely
diverse, no standards will be suggested here.  However, readers should note
the potential benefits of such a practice, and may wish to adopt a suitable
convention for their own applications.
