<P>
IBM* OS/2* Presentation Manager* is a graphical user interface facility
that allows the creation of object-oriented, event-driven applications which
conform to IBM Systems Application Architecture* (SAA*) Common User Access*
(CUA*) guidelines.  Presentation Manager provides an application execution
environment under which such applications are executed, and under which
they may take full advantage of the advanced capabilities of the OS/2 operating
system environment, as well as a system-level mechanism to handle interaction
between the application and the user in a consistent and intuitive manner.

<P>
The object-based Presentation Manager application model facilitates the
use of object-oriented software engineering principles such as data abstraction
and encapsulation.  The application of these principles enhances application
modularity and thereby contributes to increased potential for code reuse
and easier application maintenance through containment of change, thereby
achieving higher levels of productivity in the areas of application development
and maintenance.
<P>
This document examines the Presentation Manager execution environment in
order to describe the structure and implementation of Presentation Manager
applications, and to illustrate the facilities provided by Presentation
Manager to support object-oriented techniques.  In addition, the document
examines the ways in which CUA guidelines may be implemented by Presentation
Manager applications within the object-oriented application model.  Particular
emphasis is given to the use of software engineering principles which facilitate
the creation of reusable code for common application services.  This is
one of the primary concerns of the object-oriented approach to application
design, and is also one aspect of the Systems Application Architecture  Common
Applications ("red layer") component.
<P>
The document also discusses the management of workstation-based application
development projects.  Historically, workstation applications have typically
fallen into the systems software category, or have been "one-off" applications
and hence have not been subject to the same rules and disciplines imposed
upon the traditionally host-based line-of-business applications.  However,
as the OS/2 environment begins to provide a viable platform for the implementation
of workstation-based and cooperative line-of-business applications, typical
corporate investments in workstation software are increasing rapidly, and
therefore the management and maintenance of these investments must be considered.
 Some suggestions on the management of the workstation-based development
process are given in <A HREF="448_L1_ManagingDevelopment.html">Managing
Development</A>.
