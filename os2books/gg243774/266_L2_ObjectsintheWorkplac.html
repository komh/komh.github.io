<H1>Objects in the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 286 -->
<P>
An object in the Workplace Shell conforms closely to the definition of an
application object given in <A HREF="205_L1_ThePresentationManag.html">The
Presentation Manager Application Model</A>, in that it consists of a set
of data and a number of methods that operate upon that data.  Each Workplace
Shell object is an instance of a particular object class. In accordance
with normal object-oriented theory, the class defines the basic characteristics
of the object and the way in which the object responds to events.
