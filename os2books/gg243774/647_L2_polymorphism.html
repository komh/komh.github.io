polymorphism

Concept whereby the behavior of an application object is dependent solely
upon the class and contents of the messages received by that object, and
is not affected by any other external factor.  Similarly, the effect of
the same message class is dependent upon the application object to which
it is passed, and that object's interpretation of the message.
