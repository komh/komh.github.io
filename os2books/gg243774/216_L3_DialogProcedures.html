<H1>Dialog Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 230 -->
<P>
A dialog procedure is a special type of window procedure that is associated
with a modal dialog box and processes messages intended for that dialog
box. The structure of a dialog procedure is similar to that of a "normal"
window procedure, and it processes messages in the same way, although certain
message classes received by a dialog procedure are different from those
received and processed by a normal window procedure.  The structure of a
typical dialog procedure is shown in <A HREF="015_L2_StructureofaDialogPr.html">Figure
"Structure of a Dialog Procedure"</A>.
<P>
Since modal dialog boxes do not belong to a class, they are not registered
to Presentation Manager in the manner of a normal window.  A dialog procedure
is associated with a dialog box as part of a<B> WinDlgBox()</B> call, which
loads a modal dialog box and processes the dialog as a single operation,
or a<B> WinLoadDlg()</B> call, which loads the dialog box into memory but
does not process it;  the dialog box may subsequently be processed by a
<B>WinProcessDlg()</B> call.  The processes of providing input to and obtaining
results from a dialog procedure are discussed in <A HREF="238_L1_BuildingaPresentatio.html">Building
a Presentation Manager Application</A>.
<P>
Note that since a modeless dialog box is simply an optimized (non-sizable)
window with no other inherent properties such as modality, it receives the
same messages as a standard window, and its methods are therefore contained
within a normal window procedure rather than a dialog procedure.
<P>
Note that a dialog box must use the<I> system</I> linkage convention, since
it is simply a specialized form of window procedure.  This is achieved using
the EXPENTRY keyword.
<P>
Upon creation, a dialog box receives a message of the system-defined class
WM_INITDLG.  This is similar to the WM_CREATE message received by a normal
window upon creation, and may be processed in a similar way.  The first
parameter in the WM_INITDLG message may be used to pass a pointer to the
dialog procedure, referencing a data structure containing initialization
information or other application-specified data.
<P>
A dialog box also receives messages of class WM_CONTROL indicating events
occurring in control windows within the dialog box.  The window identifier
of the control window that dispatched the message, along with the nature
of the message, is indicated in the message parameters.  The WM_CONTROL
message is described in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager
Reference</I>.  The dialog procedure may wish to explicitly process events
indicated by WM_CONTROL messages, or it may allow such messages to pass
on to the default Presentation Manager-supplied dialog procedure<B> WinDefDlgProc()</B>.

<P>
A dialog box also typically receives WM_COMMAND messages, which are generated
when a pushbutton within the dialog box is pressed by the user. The identity
of the pushbutton is indicated in the first parameter of the WM_COMMAND
message.
<P>
The symbolic names DID_OK and DID_CANCEL are defined by Presentation Manager,
and by convention are used to refer to the "OK" and "Cancel" pushbuttons
respectively. The definition of dialog boxes is described in detail in <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation
Manager Resources</A>.
<P>
A dialog procedure is terminated and the dialog box is destroyed when the
dialog procedure issues a<B> WinDismissDlg()</B> call to Presentation Manager,
typically as a result of the user pressing a pushbutton. By convention,
this call specifies a parameter indicating TRUE if the user completed the
dialog by pressing an "Enter" or "OK" pushbutton, or FALSE if the user cancelled
the dialog by pressing a "Cancel" pushbutton.  The value specified in this
parameter is returned to the window procedure that issued the<B> WinDlgBox()
</B>or<B> WinProcessDlg()</B> call, as the return value from that call.

<P>
Message boxes do not require an application-supplied procedure to carry
out their processing.  The simple nature of the message box dialog allows
it to be processed by Presentation Manager on the application's behalf,
and to return the result to the application for subsequent action.
