<H1>Symbolic Names and Constants</H1><!-- entering slot 503 -->
<P>
In a PM application, symbolic names are typically used within an application
to represent numeric values such as message classes or control window identifiers
by a meaningful name rather than a less meaningful numeric representation.
 A list of suggested prefixes is given in <A HREF="143_L2_TypePrefixesforSymbo.html">Table
"Type Prefixes for Symbolic Constants"</A>, to give an indication of type
when using a symbolic name or constant.
<P>
These one-, two- or three-letter prefixes may be concatenated with the actual
symbolic names of control windows, window classes etc., in order to provide
a more meaningful representation of the symbolic name in the source code.
