<H1>Semaphore Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 412 -->
<P>
The enhanced semaphore functions available under OS/2 Version 2.0 were described
in <A HREF="175_L1_OperatingSystem2.html">Operating System/2</A>.  Previous
versions of OS/2 provided only basic semaphore facilities with limited capability
to handle multiple events.  Where these semaphores were used in applications
under previous versions of OS/2, they may be updated to the new OS/2 Version
2.0 semaphore facilities using the following guidelines:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where a semaphore is used to serialize the access
to a particular data object or system resource from multiple threads, a
<I>mutex</I> semaphore should be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where a semaphore is used to signal an event occurring
in one thread to other threads having an interest in this event, an<I> event
</I>semaphore should be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where an application waits upon the clearing of one
semaphore from a range of semaphores using the<B> DosMuxWaitSem()</B> function,
this function may be replaced by the use of a<I> muxwait</I> semaphore.

<P>
The muxwait semaphore has additional flexibility over the use of the<B> DosMuxWaitSem()
</B>function with normal semaphores under previous versions of OS/2, since
with a muxwait semaphore, a thread may wait for any<I> one</I> of a list
of mutex semaphores or event semaphores to be cleared (as with previous
versions), or may wait for<I> all</I> of the semaphores to be cleared.  This
latter capability is not available under OS/2 Version 1.3.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The enhanced semaphore functions available under OS/2 Version 2.0 are described
in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program Reference</I>.
