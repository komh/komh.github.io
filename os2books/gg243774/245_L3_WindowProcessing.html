<P>
During execution, a window processes messages passed to it by Presentation
Manager, using the methods defined in its window procedure.  Upon receiving
a message, the window procedure performs three basic tasks:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The window procedure determines the message class
by examining the message class identifier.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Depending upon the message class, the window
procedure executes a series of application instructions and/or subroutines
to perform the action requested by the message.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The window procedure passes a return code to
Presentation Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
As part of the second step above, the window procedure may extract necessary
information from the parameters passed with the message, using a number
of macros provided by Presentation Manager.  These macros are described
in <A HREF="255_L3_CreatingMessageParam.html">Creating Message Parameters</A>.

<P>
The window procedure may also gain access to instance data or resource handles
stored in a control block during processing of previous messages. This control
block is generally allocated upon creation of the window and a pointer to
it stored in the window words.  The window procedure may retrieve this pointer
from the window words at  the start of processing for the current message.

Words</A>.
