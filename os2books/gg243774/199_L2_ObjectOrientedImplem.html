<H1>Object-Oriented Implementations</H1><!-- entering slot 210 -->
<P>
There has been much discussion in the computing industry press concerning
application development products and tools that support the creation of
object-oriented applications.  While the use of such products is a valuable
aid in designing and developing an object-oriented application, it should
not be construed that their use is essential to the successful implementation
of an object-oriented approach.
<P>
It is quite possible to implement module-based object-oriented principles
to a practical and beneficial degree in the Presentation Manager environment,
using a "conventional" programming language such as "C".  However, the degree
of discipline and amount of work required of the application developer is
greater when a standard programming language is used.  Object-oriented tools
or language extensions make the task of the application developer much easier,
since many of the object-oriented concepts are handled by the tools themselves,
without the need for the developer to concern him/herself with the details
of their implementation.
<P>
Object-oriented programming tools fall into two general categories:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Those that provide extensions to an existing programming
language and implement certain object-oriented conventions, such as C++.
These languages typically provide object-oriented constructs but do not
force an application developer into the use of such constructs.  The strength
of such implementations is their flexibility, but they have the inherent
weakness that it is easy to develop application code that does not conform
to object-oriented programming practices.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Those that provide a complete programming language
syntax, which obeys and implements object-oriented principles, such as Smalltalk
V**. These languages provide an additional benefit in that they force the
application developer into obeying object-oriented programming practices,
but at the expense of flexibility.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The tools that are marketed as "object-oriented" and which are currently
available in the marketplace tend to implement the class-based approach
to object-oriented programming.  Their primary benefit is thus that they
provide an inheritance hierarchy, and so make the task of object creation
much easier for the application developer, albeit at the risk of reduced
code efficiency and possible dependence upon a conceptual run-time environment.

<P>
The choice of an object-oriented programming tool is very much an individual
one, and depends on the requirements and priorities of the development organization,
the skills and prior experience of the application developers concerned,
and the degree to which object-oriented practices are to be enforced within
the organization.
