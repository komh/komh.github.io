<H1>Application Migration</H1><!-- entering slot 407 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides application compatibility at the executable code
level for applications written to run under previous versions of OS/2.  Hence
no modification is necessary to enable such applications to run under Version
2.0. However, in order to take full advantage of the enhanced capabilities
of OS/2 Version 2.0, such as the 32-bit flat memory model and the additional
features implemented by Presentation Manager, applications will require
modification of their source code.
<P>
Application developers who wish to migrate their code to the 32-bit programming
environment under OS/2 Version 2.0 should experience little difficulty.
Changes between the OS/2 Version 2.0 programming environment and that provided
under previous versions of OS/2 fall into the following basic categories:

<P>
The remainder of this chapter will describe each of these categories in
detail, and suggest methods by which the required changes may be made.
<P>
Note that it is<I> not</I> mandatory for an application to migrate all its
modules and resources to the 32-bit programming environment.  OS/2 Version
2.0 allows mixed model programming, where 32-bit applications may make use
of existing 16-bit modules and resources.  The subject of mixed model programming
is discussed in <A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing 16-Bit
and 32-Bit Application Modules</A>.
