<H1>Loading Dialogs From a DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 353 -->
<P>
The<B> WinDlgBox()</B> function also allows a DLL module handle to be specified,
and thus enables dialog template definitions to be loaded from a DLL. For
instance, to load and create a dialog box from a dialog template resource
DC_001 defined in a DLL module named WINDLL.DLL, the following call sequence
is used:
<PRE>rc = DosLoadModule(NULL,                  /* No object name           */
                   0,                     /* No object length         */
                   "MYDLL",               /* DLL module name          */
                   hModule);              /* DLL handle (returned)    */

rc = WinDlgBox(hDesktop,                  /* Desktop is parent        */
               hFrame,                    /* Frame is owner           */
               dpProc001,                 /* Dialog procedure address */
               hModule,                   /* DLL module handle        */
               DC_001,                    /* Resource ID within DLL   */
               NULL);                     /* No create parameters     */
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if the dialog procedure<I> dpProc001</I> to be associated with
this dialog box is also defined within the DLL module, the address of this
procedure must be obtained by the application before the<B> WinDlgBox()
</B>call is issued.  This is achieved using the<B> DosGetProcAddr()</B> function,
which returns the address of the required function, as shown in the following
example:
<PRE>rc = DosGetProcAddr(hModule,
                    "Proc1",
                    dpProc001);
</PRE>

<P>
In this case,<I> Proc1</I> is the name of the required entry point in the
DLL module, and<I> dpProc001</I> is a variable of type PFNWP which contains
the address of the procedure returned by the<B> DosGetProcAddr()</B> call.
 While the address of the dialog procedure could have been supplied implicitly
by using load-time rather than run-time dynamic linking, run-time dynamic
linking is necessary to load the dialog box resource, and it is logical
to place the resource and its associated dialog procedure in the same DLL
module.  An example of the complete procedure required to load a dialog
box from a DLL is given in <A HREF="082_L2_LoadingaDialogResour.html">Figure
"Loading a Dialog Resource From a DLL"</A>.
<P>
When loading dialogs from DLL modules, it is recommended that a combination
of load-time and run-time dynamic linking techniques be used.  A calling
routine should be placed in the DLL which, in response to an application
request, loads and obtains the appropriate module handle, obtains the required
dialog procedure address and executes the dialog.  This relieves the application
of the responsibility for loading the dynamically-linked resources and routines.
 An example of such a routine is given in <A HREF="082_L2_LoadingaDialogResour.html">Figure
"Loading a Dialog Resource From a DLL"</A>.  The calling routine<I> CustInfoDlg
</I>is defined as an entry point within the DLL module, since it will be
called from the application's main executable module.  An import library
is then built for the DLL, and linked with the application code using standard
conventions for load-time dynamic linking.
<P>
When<I> CustInfoDlg</I> is invoked by the application, it obtains a module
handle for its own DLL module, which has already been loaded when the call
to<I> CustInfoDlg</I> was made, and uses this handle to obtain the address
of the required dialog procedure using standard run-time dynamic linking
conventions.  It then issues a<B> WinDlgBox()</B> call to load and process
the dialog box, and returns the result to the application.  This example
illustrates the combination of load-time and run-time dynamic linking conventions.
