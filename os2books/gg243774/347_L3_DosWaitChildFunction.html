<H1>DosWaitChild() Function</H1><!-- entering slot 382 -->
<P>
The<B> DosWaitChild()</B> function allows a thread within a process to wait
upon the termination of an asynchronous child process, in a similar manner
to the <B> DosWaitThread()</B> function.  The<B> DosWaitChild()</B>  function
allows a thread to wait for the termination of a single child  process,
or the termination of an entire process tree (that is, a  process and all
of its descendants).
<P>
Note that only the calling thread in the parent process is suspended during
a<B> DosWaitChild()</B> call.  If the parent process has  other threads,
they will continue to be dispatched.
<P>
The<B> DosWaitChild()</B> function can also be used to check the  termination
status of a child process that has already terminated,  provided that process
was started with the EXEC_ASYNCRESULT flag  specified in the<B> DosExecPgm()
</B>call.  The use of this flag  causes OS/2 to store the result code from
the child process, for future  reference by a<B> DosWaitChild()</B> call.

<P>
An example of the<B> DosWaitChild()</B> function is given in <A HREF="104_L2_DosWaitChildFunction.html">Figure
"DosWaitChild() Function"</A>. Specifying the DCWA_PROCESS flag in the first
parameter of the<B> DosWaitChild()</B> call causes the calling thread to
wait only  upon the specified process, and not upon its children (if any).
 If a  thread is to wait upon the entire process tree, the DCWA_PROCESSTREE
 flag must be specified.
<P>
The DCWW_WAIT flag in the second parameter causes the calling thread  to
wait until the specified process has terminated.  The DCWW_NOWAIT  flag
would cause the<B> DosWaitChild()</B> call to return  immediately, without
waiting for a child process to end.  The  DCWW_NOWAIT flag is typically
used when checking the termination status  of a child process that has already
ended.
