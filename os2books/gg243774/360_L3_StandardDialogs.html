<H1>Standard Dialogs</H1><!-- entering slot 396 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides standard dialog boxes for handling the selection
of files and fonts.  These dialogs conform to SAA CUA guidelines, and are
implemented within Presentation Manager.  Applications are therefore not
required to explicitly design and code such dialog functions, nor to modify
them should the CUA guidelines change in the future.
<P>
The standard dialogs are displayed using two Presentation Manager functions
new to OS/2 Version 2.0; these are the<B> WinFileDlg()</B> and<B> WinFontDlg()
</B>functions.
<P>
<B>File Dialog</B>
<P>
The standard file dialog enables a user to specify a file to be opened or
a file name under which current work is to be saved, including  the ability
to switch directories and logical drives.  The file dialog  provides basic
capabilities, and is designed in such a way that it may  be modified if
additional function is required.
<P>
The file dialog is displayed using the<B> WinFileDlg()</B> function.  The
dialog may be displayed as either an "Open" dialog or a "Save as" dialog,
depending upon the value of control flags specified in a FILEDLG structure
passed as a parameter to the function call.  The<B> WinFileDlg()</B> function
is shown in <A HREF="109_L2_StandardDialogsWinFi.html">Figure "Standard
Dialogs - WinFileDlg() Function"</A>.
<P>
The appearance of the file dialog is controlled by the FDS_* style flags
specified in the<I> fl</I> field in the FILEDLG structure.  The fields in
this structure are:<B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
Field<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Usage</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> cbSize
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Defines the size of the FILEDLG structure,
and should be initialized using the sizeof() function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> fl
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Style flags of the form FDS_*, which control
the attributes of the dialog.  These flags are described in the<I> IBM OS/2
Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> IUser
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Used by applications to store their own state
information if subclassing the dialog in order to modify its appearance
or behavior.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> IReturn</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->

<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>ISRC</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> System return
code which indicates the reason for dialog failure, if a failure has occurred.
 This field is used to assist in debugging.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> pszTitle
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Dialog title text.  If set to NULL, the text
will default to "Open"  or "Save As", depending upon the FDS_* flags selected.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>pszOKButton</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Text
used for the<I> OK</I> pushbutton on the dialog.  If set to NULL, the text
defaults to "OK".<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> pfnDlgProc</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Pointer
to custom dialog procedure, for custom dialogs with the FDS_CUSTOM style
flag set.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> pszIType</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> String
pointer to a string defining the initial Extended Attribute type filter
to be applied to the file name field in the dialog.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> pszITypeList
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Pointer to a table of string pointers.  Each
points to a null terminated string defining an Extended Attribute type filter.
 The filters are displayed in ascending order in the Type pull-down box.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>pszIDrive</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Pointer
to a string specifying the initial logical drive to be applied in the dialog.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>ppszIDriveList</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Pointer
to a table of string pointers.  Each points to a null terminated string
defining a valid logical drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> hMod</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> If
the FDS_CUSTOM style flag is set, this field defines the DLL module handle
that contains the file dialog template to be used.  If set to NULL, the
dialog template is loaded from the application's EXE file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> szFullFile
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>On initialization, this field contains the
initial fully qualified<!-- entering slot 397 --> path and file name, and
on completion of the dialog, contains the selected or user-specified fully
qualified file name.  Upon invocation of the dialog, all drive and path
data is stripped from the name, and moved to the appropriate fields in the
dialog box.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> ppszFQFilename</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Pointer
to a table of pointers.  Each points to a null terminated string containing
a fully qualified file name. This table is used by applications that require
multiple files to be selected from within the file dialog (indicated by
specifying FDS_MULTIPLESEL).  The storage is allocated by the file dialog
procedure, and must be freed after dialog completion using the WinFileFreeFileList()
function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> IFQFCount</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Number
of file names selected in the file dialog, for dialogs with multiple selection
enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> idDlg</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Window
identifier of the dialog window.  If the FDS_CUSTOM style flag is set, this
is also the resource identifier of the dialog template.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> x,y
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Position of the dialog, relative to its parent.
 These fields are automatically updated by the dialog procedure when the
dialog is moved by the user, so that if the same FILEDLG procedure is used
on subsequent invocations, the dialog will appear in the same location.
 The FDS_CENTER style flag overrides any settings specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> sEAType
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Extended Attribute file type to be be assigned
to the file.  This field contains the returned value specified in the<I> Type
</I>field in the dialog.  This field is valid only for a "Save As" dialog;
the value -1 is returned for an "Open" dialog.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
For applications with specialized file handling requirements, the standard
file dialog may be subclassed, allowing these requirements to be handled
while retaining standard processing for the majority of events.  This subclassing
is invoked by specifying the address of an application-defined dialog procedure
in the<I> pfnDlgProc</I> field  in the FILEDLG structure, and by specifying
the resource identifier of  an application-defined dialog template if controls
are to be added or  removed from the dialog.
<P>
Note that application-defined dialog procedures should invoke the<B> WinFileDlgProc()
</B>function as their default case for message processing, to ensure that
messages not explicitly processed by the application are passed to the standard
file dialog procedure for correct default processing.
<P>
<B>Font Dialog</B>
<P>
The standard font dialog enables a user to specify a choice of font names,
styles, and sizes from the range available within a given application.  The
font dialog is intended to fit basic application needs, and is designed
in such a way that additional function may be added by subclassing the dialog
procedure.
<P>
The font dialog is displayed using the<B> WinFontDlg()</B> function, specifying
the owner window for the dialog box, and a FONTDLG control structure.  The
use of the<B> WinFontDlg()</B> function is shown in <A HREF="110_L2_WinFontDlgFunctionSa.html">Figure
"WinFontDlg() Function - Sample Code"</A>.
<P>
The appearance of the dialog is determined by the FNTS_* flags specified
in the<I> fl</I> field of the FONTDLG structure, and by the other fields
in this structure.  The fields in the FONTDLG structure are:<B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>String containing a list of numeric point sizes,
to be displayed in  the<I> Point<!-- entering slot 398 --> Size</I> drop-down
list in the dialog box.  Point sizes within the string must be separated
by spaces.  If set to NULL, the defaults of 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 are
used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL> Position
of the dialog relative to its parent.  These fields are automatically updated

the file dialog template to be used.  If set to NULL, the dialog template
is loaded from the application's EXE file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Applications may customize the font dialog through subclassing, by specifying
the FNTS_CUSTOM style flag, giving the resource identifier and module handle
of the application's customized font dialog template,  and the address of
an application-defined dialog procedure, in the FONTDLG structure.  The
<B>WinFontDlg()</B> function then performs the subclassing operation on
the application's behalf.
<P>
Note that application-defined dialog procedures should invoke the<B> WinFontDlgProc()
</B>function as their default case for message processing, to ensure that
messages not explicitly processed by the application are passed to the standard
font dialog procedure for correct default processing.
<P>
An application that uses its own dialog template<I> must</I> include all
of the standard controls within the dialog box, in addition  to its own
customized controls.  Those controls, which are not  required, may be rendered
invisible in order to provide the correct  appearance.
<P>
Control window identifiers in the range 0x0000 to 0x0FFF are reserved for
use by standard controls.  The application's own controls should therefore
use window identifiers greater than 0x0FFF.
