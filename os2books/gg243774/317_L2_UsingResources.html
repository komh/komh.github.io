<P>
As mentioned throughout this chapter, resources are typically loaded and
used in an application by specifying the symbolic name of the resource as
a parameter to a function that requires the resource.  The resource is then
loaded and used by that function in performing its task.  However, there
are several ways in which the resource may be loaded, depending upon where
it resides.  These are discussed in the following sections.
