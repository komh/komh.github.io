<H1>Communicating With Another Process</H1><!-- entering slot 370 -->
<P>
Communication between processes must use one of the architected methods
provided by OS/2, since the operating system by default prohibits different
processes from accessing the same resources.  For this reason, communication
between processes is slightly more complex than communication between threads,
but requires less care on the part of the programmer to ensure synchronization
and data integrity.
<P>
The mechanisms provided by OS/2 for interprocess communication are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Each of these mechanisms is explained in detail in the <I> IBM OS/2 Version
2.0 Application Design Guide</I>, and simple examples are given in the following
 sections.
