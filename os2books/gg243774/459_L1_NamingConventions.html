<H1>Naming Conventions</H1><!-- entering slot 502 -->
<P>
It is often a desirable practice to implement common naming conventions
for application routines and for symbolic constant and variable names.  The
adoption of such techniques facilitates application readability and code
maintenance, since the nature and role of various routines and data items
used by an application may be more easily understood.  This chapter proposes
some naming conventions; it is not suggested that application developers
should use these conventions slavishly, but that they should use the suggestions
provided as guidelines in developing their own consistent set of organizational
standards.
<P>
The conventions proposed herein will cover the following areas:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Symbolic names and constants<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Subroutine names<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Window and dialog procedure names<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Variable names.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The conventions proposed will adhere to most "standard" C programming conventions,
in that lowercase characters will be used for routine and variable names,
with uppercase characters used for symbolic names and constants.  Application
developers wishing to use standardized naming conventions for applications
written in other languages will obviously need to adapt these conventions
to suit their particular language implementation.
<P>
The conventions proposed herein will also use a notational concept known
as <A HREF="587_L2_Hungariannotation.html"><B>Hungarian notation</B></A>,
named for its inventor, Charles Simyoni.  Under this notational system each
variable, symbolic name or procedure name is prefixed by a one-, two- or
three-character mnemonic that indicates its type or function.
