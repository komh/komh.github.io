<H1>Private Header File</H1><!-- entering slot 510 -->
<P>
Each source module should have its own private header file, or have the
contents of such a file included in the source module itself.  The private
header file should itself include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Declarations for all local constants used within the
source module; that is, those constants that are not accessed or referenced
from outside the source module.  This includes those application-defined
message classes used by a window procedure in indicating events to itself,
or by dependent functions and/or subroutines to indicate messages to their
parent window procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Declarations for all non-local variables used within
the source module; that is, those variables that are accessed from more
than one routine within the source module, but are not accessed from outside
the source module.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Prototypes for all functions and subroutines that
are accessed only from within the source module.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
A private header file should be referenced, using an appropriate<I> #include
</I>statement, only by its own source module.
