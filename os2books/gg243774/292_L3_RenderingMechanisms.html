<H1>Rendering Mechanisms</H1><!-- entering slot 321 -->
<P>
Rendering mechanisms are the means by which the source and target of a drag/drop
operation determine the data type of the dragitem and the format of the
information to be exchanged.
<P>
While the precise sequence of events that takes place after a drop has occurred
is dependent upon the application, a number of standard rendering mechanisms
have been defined to enable diverse applications to engage in direct manipulation
with one another.  These standard rendering mechanisms are used by various
components of OS/2, as well as being available for use by applications.

<P>
Three standard rendering mechanisms are provided by Presentation Manager
and are documented in the<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming Guide Volume II</I>:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>DRM_PRINT</B><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> This rendering mechanism is designed
for applications that wish to provide printing facilities via direct manipulation,
by allowing the user to drag items from the application and drop them on
one of the Workplace Shell printer objects.
<P>
It is a very simple mechanism.  When an object is dropped on a printer object,
the printer object sends a DM_PRINTOBJECT message, one parameter of which
gives the name of the print queue represented by that printer object.  It
is then the responsibility of the source window to print the relevant data
to the specified queue.
<P>
Note that in OS/2 Version 1.3, the DM_PRINT message was used for this purpose,
rather than the DM_PRINTOBJECT message.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DRM_OS2FILE
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>This rendering mechanism is intended for applications
that wish to allow the dragging and dropping of file objects between windows
or folders on the desktop.  Such applications include the File Manager in
OS/2 Version 1.3, or the<I> Drives</I> objects in OS/2 V2.0.
<P>
With this mechanism, all information about the source file may be contained
in the fields of the DRAGITEM structure, so it is not necessary for a protracted
conversation to take place between source and target windows.  In the simplest
case, the target can complete the operation using only this information
with no further involvement from the source window, though this rendering
mechanism does allow for more interaction between the two windows should
this be useful.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DRM_DDE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> The
DDE rendering mechanism is intended for applications in which drag/drop
actions will be used to set up DDE links between windows.  The DDE then
proceeds according to standard DDE protocols.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Further rendering mechanisms may be devised and documented for use by a
particular user's applications.  The creation and use of rendering mechanisms
is discussed in <A HREF="303_L2_UsingRenderingMechan.html">Using Rendering
Mechanisms</A>.
