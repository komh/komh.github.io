<P>
Presentation Manager also supports the development of online, context-sensitive
help panels, along with online documents for support of applications, business
processes and computer-based training.  Such information may be displayed
in windows on the Presentation Manager desktop, using the <A HREF="594_L2_InformationPresentat.html"><B>Information
Presentation Facility</B> (<B>IPF</B>)</A>, which is shipped with the operating
system.
<P>
Help panels displayed using IPF are context-sensitive, thereby allowing
the user to request help on a specific topic, and the application to that
help in a window on the Presentation Manager desktop.  Help panels within
an application may be indexed, which allows a user to search for help on
related topics in addition to the topic initially requested.
<P>
Phrases or illustrations within panels may be marked as selectable, and
used to display additional information, initiate application events or start
new applications.  This capability is provided by the <A HREF="589_L2_hypertext.html"><B>hypertext
</B></A>and <A HREF="588_L2_hypergraphics.html"><B>hypergraphics</B></A> facilities
of IPF.
<P>
Online documents may also be generated by IPF.  Such documents are not linked
to applications; they act as applications in their own right, and indeed
may be used to initiate the execution of application programs using the
hypertext facility of IPF.  Online documents may also be indexed, and keyword
searches may be conducted on document files; these facilities are part of
IPF.
<P>
Information Presentation Facility is described in detail in <A HREF="397_L1_AddingOnlineHelpandD.html">Adding
