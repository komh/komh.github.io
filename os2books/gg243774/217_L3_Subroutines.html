<P>
Subroutines may be used in a Presentation Manager application, in the same
way as they are used in any other application. However, in order to conform
to object-oriented practices, subroutine calls should only be used to achieve
functional isolation within the methods of a single application object,
or to perform a standard processing function that is common to a number
of objects; in this case, the scope of each execution instance of the subroutine
is limited to a single object.  In accordance with object-oriented programming
guidelines, communication between objects (windows) should be achieved using
messages, and hence window procedures should not be invoked directly as
subroutines.  See <A HREF="257_L2_PassingControl.html">Passing Control</A> for
further discussion on the use of subroutines in Presentation Manager applications.
