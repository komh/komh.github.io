<P>
The ability to define resources such as window and dialog templates externally
to the application, in conjunction with the dynamic linking facilities provided
by the OS/2 operating system, provides a powerful tool for the creation
of generic application objects, comprised of window/dialog templates and
their associated window or dialog procedures.  These application objects
may be defined and stored in dynamic link libraries for subsequent use by
one or more applications.  This practice is in accordance with the guidelines
for Systems Application Architecture Common Applications, which provide
for common application services within and between environments, as well
as common user applications.  This concept is further discussed in <A HREF="438_L1_GenericApplicationMo.html">Generic
Application Modules</A>.  Note however, that the use of generic application
objects presupposes that the nature of and message interfaces to such application
objects are well-defined and documented, in order to allow application developers
to correctly select and interact with the generic objects.
<P>
For instance, a standard dialog box that will be used by many applications
could be defined in a dialog template, resource compiled and stored in a
dynamic link library, along with the dialog procedure which performs the
processing for that dialog.  The dialog can then be loaded from the DLL
by any application which needs to use it.  The dialog need be coded only
once, and may be modified at any time while requiring no source code changes
to the applications that access it.  The fact that DLL code is not bound
with the application at link edit time like other library code also means
that no changes are required to the object code of the applications, and
thus recompilation and link edit is not required.  An example of this technique
is given in <A HREF="307_L1_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager
Resources</A>.
<P>
The window or dialog procedure associated with a generic object should contain
all the methods normally used to perform actions upon that object, but need
not contain every action that will ever be necessary.  If an application
requires a specialized action on a generic object (that is, a previously
undefined action or a modification of an existing action), the window acting
as a handle to that object may be subclassed, and a new window procedure
substituted for the existing window procedure. This new window procedure
would contain methods to process the specific messages in which it has an
interest, and would then invoke the original window procedure to handle
any other message classes, in accordance with the object-oriented principle
of inheritance. Subclassing is discussed further in <A HREF="225_L2_Subclassing.html">Subclassing</A>.
