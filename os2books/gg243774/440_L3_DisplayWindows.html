<P>
A display window may be created as a generic application object, and its
window procedure placed in a dynamic link library.  The following steps
are typically followed in creating such a window procedure:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Both the window procedure and a calling routine
to create the window are written in the normal manner.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The routine containing the code to create the
window is declared as an exportable entry point, and may thus be called
by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->This routine returns the handle of the newly
created window to the calling application, along with a success or failure
code.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The source code is compiled and link edited as
described in <A HREF="392_L3_CreatingaDLL.html">Creating a DLL</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The calling application then simply issues a single function call, such
as:
<PRE>usSuccess = CreateEditWindow(hEdit);
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> CreateEditWindow()</I> function within the DLL handles all necessary
operations including registration of the window class and creation of the
window, places the resulting window handle in the address indicated by the
<I>hEdit</I> parameter, and returns a success or failure code<I> (usSuccess)
</I>to the calling application.
<P>
Note, however, that the above example assumes that the window is created
with a predetermined title, size and position on the desktop.  Should this
not be the case, additional parameters to the<I> CreateWindow()</I> function
would be required.
<P>
The definition of the<I> CreateEditWindow()</I> function as the only entry
point in the DLL enforces the consistency of using this function.  The calling
application is still provided with the window handle, which allows it to
communicate with the window and to subclass the window if required.
