<H1>Transient Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a Workplace Shell object differs from
a Presentation Manager window in that it is persistent; that is, it continues
to exist after a system restart.  The exception to this rule is the <A HREF="703_L2_transientobject.html"><B>transient
object</B></A>, which only exists during the current execution of the system,
and is destroyed when the system is IPLed.
<P>
Transient objects are useful when a programmer wishes to represent and display
information such as records from a database.  As each record is retrieved,
a transient object is created for that record and displayed in a folder
on the Workplace Shell desktop.  These objects may be opened and manipulated
by the end user, but will cease to exist when the system is IPLed.
<P>
<A HREF="066_L2_CreatingaTransientOb.html">Figure "Creating a Transient
Object"</A> shows an object window in a requester process which, upon receiving
a completed database query from a server process, invokes the<I> _wpclsNew
</I>method to create a new instance of a transient object class, representing
the record retrieved from the database.
<P>
The SOM pointer to the transient object class is obtained using the<B> SOMIdFromString()
</B>macro and the<I> _somFindClass</I> method (see <A HREF="285_L2_CommunicationBetween.html">Communication
Between Objects</A> for further information).  This pointer is then used
to invoke the<I> _wpclsNew</I> method to create a new instance of the class.
 Once the new instance is created, a method named<I> _SetCustInfo</I>, which
is defined by the transient object class, is invoked to insert the information
retrieved from the database into the object's instance data.
<P>
Note that the technique shown in <A HREF="066_L2_CreatingaTransientOb.html">Figure
"Creating a Transient Object"</A> may only be used when an object is created
from within the Workplace Shell process.  If an object must be created from
another process in the system, the<B> WinCreateObject()</B> function must
be used.
