<H1>The DRAGTRANSFER Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 327 -->
<P>
This structure is passed with a DM_RENDER message, from the target to the
source window, after a drop has occurred.  It allows the target window to
inform the source of several important things.  For example, where the source
supports several different rendering mechanisms and/or formats, the target
can specify which of these it wishes to use.  Similarly, if the source supports
both copy and move operations, the target can specify which it will use
by means of the<I> usOperation</I> field of this structure.
<P>
Another important field is<I> hstrRenderToName</I>.  This tells the source
window where to place the data, so that the target will know where to find
it. The precise interpretation of this depends on the rendering mechanism;
for example, in the case of the DRM_OS2FILE rendering mechanism, it contains
the fully qualified name that the file is to be given at its destination.
Where the transfer of information between source and target window is a
simple memory transfer, this field may be used to contain the name of a
named shared memory object into which the source is to place the data.
