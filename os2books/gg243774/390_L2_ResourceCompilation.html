<H1>Resource Compilation</H1><!-- entering slot 432 -->
<P>
Presentation Manager resources used by the application and defined in a
resource script file are compiled using the resource compiler provided in
the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.0</I>.  The command sequence used
to invoke the resource compiler is as follows:
<PRE>rc MYPROG.RC MYPROG.EXE
</PRE>

<P>
This command sequence causes the resource compiler to read the resource
definitions from the resource script file MYPROG.RC and compile them to
produce an intermediate resource file MYPROG.RES, which is then incorporated
into the executable module MYPROG.EXE.
<P>
Resources may also be compiled and incorporated into dynamic link libraries,
simply by specifying the name of the DLL rather than the EXE file when invoking
the resource compiler.  Note that certain additional considerations may
apply; see <A HREF="394_L3_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager
Resources in a DLL</A> for further information.
<P>
Note that under OS/2 Version 2.0, 32-bit applications may use existing 16-bit
application modules and resources.  This concept is known as mixed model
programming, and is discussed in <A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing
16-Bit and 32-Bit Application Modules</A>.
