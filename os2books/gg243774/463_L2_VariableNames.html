<H1>Variable Names</H1><!-- entering slot 506 -->
<P>
It is far easier to determine the nature and usage of a variable if its
data type is known to the reader.  Variable names may be prefixed with mnemonics
indicating their data type, in a similar way to that proposed for symbolic
names and constants.  A list of suggested prefixes for various data types
is given in <A HREF="144_L2_TypePrefixesforVaria.html">Table "Type Prefixes
for Variables"</A>.
<P>
For example, a character string variable (a zero- or null-terminated string)
named<I> WindowTitle</I> might have an attached mnemonic prefix of<I> sz
</I>to indicate the data type, making the variable name<I> szWindowTitle</I>.
 This is a simple example; to take a more complex instance, a handle to
a window might have a variable name<I> hMainWindow</I>, which would differentiate
it in the source code from a window procedure<I> wpMainWindow</I> or other
data items relating to the window, while maintaining an indication of the
relationship between the items by the similarity in their names.
<P>
Prefixing variable names in this way has the additional advantage that a
compiler cross-reference listing will group together all variables of the
same data type.  Any redundancies may thus be seen at a glance.
<P>
A pointer to a variable is indicated by using an additional prefix<I> p
</I>before the prefix indicating the data type of the variable.  Some examples
are shown in <A HREF="145_L2_TypePrefixesforPoint.html">Table "Type Prefixes
for Pointers"</A>.
<P>
As a further example, an unsigned integer<I> UserResponse</I> might have
a prefix of<I> us</I> making the variable name<I> usUserResponse</I>.  A
pointer to this variable would have the name<I> pusUserResponse</I>.  The
name thus indicates both the data type of the pointer and its relationship
with the variable to which it points.
