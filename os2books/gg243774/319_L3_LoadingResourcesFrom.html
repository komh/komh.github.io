<P>
Presentation Manager resources may also be defined and stored in a dynamic
link library. The process of compiling and placing resources in a DLL is
described in <A HREF="394_L3_PresentationManagerR.html">Presentation Manager
Resources in a DLL</A>.  Once a resource is located in a DLL however, the
DLL module must be loaded into memory by the application, and a module handle
obtained at run time before the resource may be accessed by a Presentation
Manager function.  This is typically achieved using the<B> DosLoadModule()
</B>or<B> DosGetModuleHandle()</B> functions. <A HREF="081_L2_LoadingResourcesFrom.html">Figure
"Loading Resources From a DLL"</A> illustrates the necessary code to load
a dynamic link library named MYDLL from a directory identified in the LIBPATH
statement in CONFIG.SYS, and to load a string resource from this DLL.
<P>
The<B> DosLoadModule()</B> function call loads the dynamic link library
with the name "MYDLL" (the default extension of .DLL is assumed) into memory
and returns a handle<I> hModule</I> of type HMODULE.  This handle is then
passed as the resource file identifier to the<B> WinLoadString()</B> function
call, which accesses the resources within the module.  Other function calls
such as<B> WinLoadPointer()</B> work in a similar manner.
