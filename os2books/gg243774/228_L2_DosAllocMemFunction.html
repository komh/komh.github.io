<H1>DosAllocMem() Function</H1><!-- entering slot 244 -->
<P>
The<B> DosAllocSeg()</B> function implemented under previous versions of
OS/2 is replaced in Version 2.0 by the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function, which
allows allocation of memory objects greater than 64KB in size.  To take
an example, <A HREF="016_L2_AllocatingMemoryinPr.html">Figure "Allocating
Memory in Previous Versions of OS/2"</A> shows the code necessary under
OS/2 Version 1.3 to allocate a 72KB area of memory for use by an application.
The application must then use<I> pSegment1</I> to reference the lower 64KB
and<I> pSegment2</I> to reference the upper 8KB of the memory object.  This
requires conditional testing for each memory reference, and thereby introduces
additional complication to the application code.  Use of the<B> DosAllocHuge()
</B>function simplifies this slightly, but arithmetic is still required
in order to correctly calculate offsets within the higher area of memory.

<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, a single<B> DosAllocMem()</B> function call is required
in order to perform the same task, as shown in <A HREF="017_L2_AllocatingMemoryinOS.html">Figure
"Allocating Memory in OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>. Subsequent references to this
memory object may simply use a 32-bit offset within the allocated address
range.
<P>
Note that since OS/2 Version 2.0 uses paged memory internally, memory allocated
using<B> DosAllocMem()</B> is<I> always</I> allocated in multiples of 4KB.
Thus, a request for 10 bytes will actually result in a full 4KB page being
committed in real storage.  Since this will lead to high fragmentation and
consequent waste of memory, the allocation of many small memory objects
using<B> DosAllocMem()</B> directly is not recommended.  Application developers
should initially use<B> DosAllocMem()</B> to allocate the maximum storage
likely to be required, and then use the<B> DosSubAlloc()</B> function to
allocate individual memory objects.  This technique allows the storage of
multiple small memory objects within the same 4KB page, thereby reducing
fragmentation and making more efficient use of storage.
<P>
Note that the<B> DosAllocHuge()</B> function provided under previous versions
of OS/2 has no counterpart under Version 2.0.  This function is not required
since<B> DosAllocMem()</B> allows the theoretical allocation of memory objects
of a size up to that of the application's entire process address space.

<P>
Memory objects allocated using<B> DosAllocMem()</B> may be freed using the
<B>DosFreeMem()</B> function.
