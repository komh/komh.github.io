<P>
Once a problem has been identified and corrections made to the application,
the resolution of the problem should be documented and placed, along with
the original problem documentation, in some form of log.  In this way, similar
problems encountered at a later date may be more easily identified and resolved
by reference to the log.
<P>
<B>Step #6: </B> After resolving the problem, document the resolution for
future reference.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

Logging systems for such information may range widely in complexity and
sophistication, from simple paper files to automated database systems with
keyword search capabilities.  The level of system implemented by a development
organization is dependent upon cost and the perceived productivity benefit
to be gained from such information; organizations with an ongoing involvement
in the development of complex Presentation Manager applications will derive
greater benefits than those with only a single development project.
