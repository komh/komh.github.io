<P>
Within a Presentation Manager application, it is recommended that the application
code be separated into distinct source modules, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Each window procedure (that is, application object)
should be placed in its own separate source module, along with functions
and subroutines created for and exclusively called by that window procedure.
 This creates the situation where a single window is contained per source
module, which preserves isolation and facilitates independence of application
objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Type definitions, variable and constant declarations
(including private message classes) and function prototypes that are local
to a particular source module should be placed in a<I> private header file
</I>or alternatively, included in the source module itself.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Function prototypes for those window procedures or
subroutines that will become the entry points to the source module should
be placed in a separate header file, along with type definitions, variable
and constant declarations that will be required by other source modules
calling those procedures or subroutines.  This header file may then be referenced
by each source module that requires access to these procedures or routines.
 This header file is known as the<I> public header file</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Global type definitions, variable and constant declarations
should be placed in a<I> global header file</I> that may be referenced by
each source module.  In the ideal case, global variables and constants should
not be used by an application, and this header file would therefore not
be required.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Generic functions and subroutines accessed by more
than one window procedure should be placed in a separate source module with
its own header file (known as a<I> generic routines header file</I>), which
may be referenced by each module requiring access to the generic routines.
This includes "functions" such as dialog definitions and dialog procedures
that are accessed from multiple window procedures, and message handling
routines.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Presentation Manager resources used by modules within
an application should be placed in a resource script file, and their associated
identifiers defined in the application's public header file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
Note that a Workplace Shell object's source code is automatically partitioned
in a similar manner to that described above, since the various files are
created by the SOM Precompiler from the object's class definition file.

<P>
Separation of the application code into its constituent application objects
in this manner facilitates the isolation and independence of application
objects, and enhances the potential for their subsequent reuse.  It also
eases the task of application maintenance and change management, by effectively
modularizing an application and therefore helping to contain the scope of
change within a single source module and its dependent header files.
<P>
The separation of header files into private, public and global definitions
in the manner described above further enhances the independence of application
objects and facilitates change management, in the following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The separation of an application object's public interfaces
means that other application objects are aware only of those interfaces,
and not of the internal definitions and operations of the application object.
Changes within an application object, to local type, variable or constant
definitions, do not impact other application objects with which the changed
object communicates<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The separation of the private and public interfaces
explicitly defines each of these interfaces, so that a maintenance programmer
is clearly aware of changes that will or will not impact other application
objects.  Other applications that do require modification as a result may
be easily identified, since their source modules will contain a reference
to the changed object's external interface header file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When managing the development of large projects, an "owner" should be appointed
for each source module.  This owner is typically a member of the development
team who bears responsibility for that module.  A module's owner should
also have the responsibility for that module's private and public header
files.
