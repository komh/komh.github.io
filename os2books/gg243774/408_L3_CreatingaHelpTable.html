<P>
A help table is a Presentation Manager resource, and is defined in a resource
script file using the HELPTABLE resource.  An example of a help table is
shown in <A HREF="131_L2_HelpTableResourceDef.html">Figure "Help Table Resource
Definition"</A>.
<P>
The HELPITEM resources within the help table define each application window
for which help is to be provided, and point to a HELPSUBTABLE resource.
Each HELPITEM resource also defines the panel identifier of the optional
extended help panel for that window.
<P>
A HELPSUBTABLE resource is defined for each window, and contains HELPSUBITEM
resources that identify each item within the window for which help is to
be provided, and the panel identifier of the help panel for that item.
<P>
For example, <A HREF="131_L2_HelpTableResourceDef.html">Figure "Help Table
Resource Definition"</A> shows a main window with the window identifier
MAIN, and a dialog box with the identifier DIALOG1.  A subtable is defined
for MAIN, which defines the menu bar items within that window, and identifies
a help panel for each of these items.  For DIALOG1, the subtable specifies
the identifiers of the control windows within the dialog box, and identifies
a help panel for each control window.  The identifiers of the help panels
must correspond to the identifiers specified in the<I> res=</I> attribute
of the header tags.
