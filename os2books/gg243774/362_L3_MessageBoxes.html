<H1>Message Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 403 -->
<P>
By convention, message boxes are used to inform the user of an event, and
to carry out a dialog with the user in the following circumstances:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where the information to be conveyed to the user is
simple and limited to no more than a few lines of text<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Where the input to be gained from the user is limited
to a single decision from a limited list of mutually exclusive options.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The type of decision available to the user from a message box is also limited
to simple choices such as "Yes/No", "OK/Cancel", or "Yes/No/Help".  Since
the buttons displayed in the message box are  push buttons, selecting any
button will result in the removal of the  message box from the screen and
immediate action on the part of the  application.  An exception to this
rule is the "Help" button, which should result in the message box being
left on the screen, and the simultaneous display of a window containing
help information.  This help window should be a child of the message box,
so that it is dismissed when the message box is closed, and the input focus
should return to the message box when the help window is dismissed.
<P>
A message box is created and processed using the<B> WinMessageBox()</B> function
as follows:
<PRE>rc = WinMessageBox(hDesktop,                 /* Desktop is parent     */
                   hwnd,                     /* Curr. window is owner */
                   szMessageText,            /* Message text          */
                   "Warning",                /* Title of message box  */
                   0,                        /* No message box ident. */
                   MB_YESNO |                /* Yes/No choices        */
                   MB_DEFBUTTON1 |           /* Yes is default choice */
                   MB_CUAWARNING);           /* Warning style         */
</PRE>

<P>
Message boxes may be of three types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Notification</B> message boxes inform the user
of a system event that requires his/her attention, but does not signify
an error or potential error condition.  Such message boxes are created with
the message style MB_CUANOTIFICATION.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Warning</B> message boxes inform the user of a
potential error condition that may affect the integrity of the application
or its data; for example, the user may try to exit the application without
 saving the latest set of changes to a data object.  Such message boxes
 are created with the message style MB_CUAWARNING.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Critical</B> message boxes inform the user of an
error condition that requires his/her immediate attention; for example,
a diskette may be unreadable.  Such message boxes are created with the message
style MB_CUACRITICAL.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These message box styles may be combined with other style identifiers that
determine the buttons to be displayed in the message box, the default action
and the modality of the message box (that is, system- or application-modal).
 These identifiers are described, along with the<B> WinMessageBox()</B> function,
in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
<P>
A message box should always be created with a title; while Presentation
Manager provides a default message title if a null title string is specified
in  the<B> WinMessageBox()</B> function, the use of this feature is not
 recommended.  A message box title should identify the object or action
 from which the message originated; for example, a message originating  from
a "Parts List" object would have the title "Parts  List", whereas a message
occurring as a result of an incorrectly completed dialog during an "Open
File" action would have a title of "Open File".
<P>
A message box is created as an optimized window, and by default is neither
moveable nor sizable.  However, the situation may arise where the message
is related to some information displayed in a window, and the decision to
be made by the user is dependent upon the nature and context of that information.
 The user must therefore be able to<!-- entering slot 404 --> view the information
in order to make the decision required by the message box, and the information
may be hidden by the message box itself.  To avoid this situation, a message
box may be specified with the style identifier MB_MOVEABLE, which allows
the message box to be moved (although not sized) by clicking the mouse on
its title in a similar fashion to that used for a standard window.
