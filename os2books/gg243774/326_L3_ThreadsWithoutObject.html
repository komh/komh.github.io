<H1>Threads Without Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 360 -->
<P>
When the processing to be performed within a secondary thread is limited
in scope to the data objects "owned" by the current application object,
an object window is not warranted.  A secondary thread without an object
window is similar in both appearance and behavior to a normal subroutine.
However, the routine executing in the secondary thread performs its tasks
asynchronously to the primary thread, although it still has access to the
same data objects.  Such a thread is typically started when required by
issuing a<B> DosCreateThread()</B> call from within a window procedure in
the primary thread.  A sample invocation of such a thread is illustrated
in <A HREF="086_L2_CreatingaThreadWitho.html">Figure "Creating a Thread
Without an Object Window"</A>.
<P>
Two considerations arise when processing asynchronous threads  without the
use of object windows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The primary thread must not attempt to access a data
object at the same time as a secondary thread is updating that data object,
since the state of the data during the update is undetermined and unpredictable
results could occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The primary thread must have some way of determining
when the secondary thread has completed its processing, at which point it
may then access the data objects that were manipulated by the secondary
thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These two conditions may be achieved by adopting a convention whereby a
secondary thread has exclusive access to its data object(s) for the duration
of its execution.  It is therefore only necessary for the  primary thread
to determine when the secondary thread has completed  processing, at which
point it may access the data objects.
<P>
Where this is not possible, mutex semaphores may be used to  serialize access
to resources such as data objects.  Each thread that  requires access must
bid for the semaphore.  If the semaphore is  already held by another thread,
the requesting thread must wait for  that thread to release the semaphore
before attempting to access the  resource.
<P>
A number of mechanisms for synchronizing execution and/or access to resources
are described in <A HREF="343_L2_MaintainingSynchroni.html">Maintaining
Synchronization</A>.
