<H1>Named versus Anonymous Shared Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 252 -->
<P>
Shared memory objects may be named or anonymous.  Named shared memory objects
have names of the form:
<PRE>\SHAREMEM\&lt;objectname.ext&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
A named shared memory object may be accessed by another process using the
<B>DosGetNamedSharedMem()</B> function.
<P>
An anonymous shared memory object must be declared as "giveable" or "gettable"
when it is allocated, in order that it may be made available to other processes
using the<B> DosGiveSharedMem()</B> or<B> DosGetSharedMem()</B> functions.
 An example is given in <A HREF="023_L2_AllocatingSharedMemo.html">Figure
"Allocating Shared Memory"</A>.
<P>
The<B> DosGiveSharedMem()</B> function can be used at any time to provide
another process with a specified level of access to a memory object, provided
that the owner of the memory object knows the process ID of the process
to which access is to be given.
