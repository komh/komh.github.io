<P>
OS/2 allows multiple threads of execution to be initiated within an application.
 Each thread is regarded as a distinct unit by the  operating system, and
is scheduled independently of other threads and  processes in the system.
 Each application has a primary thread,  created when the application is
started.  An application may optionally  create one or more additional threads,
known as secondary threads.
<P>
In certain circumstances, an application may also create additional processes
to perform some portion of the application's processing.  The use of additional
processes may be necessary where different portions  of the application's
processing must be isolated from one another.  It  is also useful for applications
that exploit the Workplace Shell since by  default, all Workplace Shell
objects share the same process and are hence  unprotected from one another.
The use of multiple processes has  performance implications due to additional
system overhead and should  thus be implemented with care.
<P>
Secondary threads and processes may contain object windows, which do  not
appear on the display screen but act as addresses to which messages  may
be sent in order to initiate application processing.  An object  window
typically "owns" a data object such as a database or  controls access to
an external entity such as a remote system.  Where  the processing in response
to an application event requires access to  another data object, the use
of object windows in a secondary thread is  recommended.
<P>
Communication with an object window is performed in the normal way  using
Presentation Manager messages.  With suitable programming  conventions,
the handle of the object window may easily be made  available to the calling
window in order for such messages to be posted.
<P>
A single object window may receive messages from multiple windows,  and
perform actions on its data object on behalf of those windows.  This approach
allows easy coordination of requests for access to a data  object, enhancing
data integrity and efficiency of access.  Applications that use this technique
follow the basic client-server  architecture, within the boundaries of the
Presentation Manager application model.
<P>
Where the scope of a long-running event is restricted to a single  method
within the current application object, a secondary thread or  process may
be initiated without an object window.  In such cases, a  subroutine is
initiated in the secondary thread, and the thread  terminates immediately
upon exiting that subroutine.
<P>
Presentation Manager provides a number of methods by which an application
can synchronize access to data objects and determine whether a secondary
thread or process has completed processing an event.  These methods involve
the use of functions such as<B> DosWaitThread()</B> or <B> DosWaitChild()</B>,
Presentation Manager messages and/or event semaphores.
<P>
The multitasking capabilities of OS/2 allow greater application responsiveness
since lengthy application processing may be performed in  an asynchronous
manner, leaving the application's primary thread free  to continue interaction
with the end user.  This also facilitates  conformance with the Systems
Application Architecture CUA guideline stipulating that an  application
should complete the processing of an event and be ready to  handle further
user input within 0.1 seconds.
