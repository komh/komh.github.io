<H1>New Presentation Manager Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 415 -->
<P>
A number of new functions have been added to Presentation Manager under
OS/2 Version 2.0.  While these functions do not add new capabilities to
the Presentation Manager interface, they simplify application development
by combining operations that previously required multiple steps into a single
Presentation Manager function call.

Functions in OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>
<P>
A number of other functions are also added in OS/2 Version 2.0, and are
used to deal with the passing of messages between 16-bit and 32-bit modules
in Presentation Manager applications.  These functions are discussed in
<A HREF="375_L1_Mixing16Bitand32BitA.html">Mixing 16-Bit and 32-Bit Application
Modules</A>.
<P>
These functions are described in more detail in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version
2.0 Presentation Manager Reference</I>.
