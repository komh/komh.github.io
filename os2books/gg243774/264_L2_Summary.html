<H1>Summary</H1><!-- entering slot 284 -->
<P>
It can be seen that by making effective use of the facilities provided by
Presentation Manager, and by following a number of simple guidelines in
the design and implementation of applications, it is relatively simple to
develop a Presentation Manager application that conforms to module-based
object-oriented programming standards, and achieves benefits through reduced
development effort and easier application maintenance, due to code reuse
and encapsulation.
<P>
It must be accepted however, that some deviation from strict object-oriented
practice may be necessary in order to preserve other important goals such
as the preservation of responsiveness to the end user. Adherence to academic
principles should not take precedence over achievement of the required result.

<P>
The mapping of data objects into application objects must be approached
with great care in the design stage of a Presentation Manager application.
 Presentation Manager allows the creation of window procedures (application
objects) that operate on more than one data object, and of multiple window
procedures that operate on the same data object.  This practice should be
discouraged however, since it reduces the level  of encapsulation in the
application object, increases the interdependence between application objects,
and consequently reduces the benefits attainable through code reuse and
containment of change.
<P>
Notwithstanding, the Presentation Manager environment affords great opportunity
for the development of applications that implement the general principles
of the object-oriented approach.  A central precept of object-oriented design
is the generic nature and consequent reusability  of the objects so created.
Adherence to guidelines that promote conformance to object-oriented concepts
such as data abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism, in conjunction
with the facilities  provided by Presentation Manager for object creation,
communication and subclassing, and by the OS/2 operating system in the form
of dynamic linking, facilitates the development of highly granular, reusable
generic objects in the Presentation Manager environment.
