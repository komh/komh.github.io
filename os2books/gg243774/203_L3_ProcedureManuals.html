<P>
An administrative procedure, which is merely a set of information that documents
the way in which a task must be performed, may also be regarded as a <A HREF="654_L2_proceduralentity.html"><B>procedural
entity</B></A> that may be encapsulated in an application object. Such an
application object typically contains a small number of methods, and may
possibly contain only one.
<P>
In the case of an object that contains only a single method and merely accepts
data from a calling application object rather than possessing data objects
of its own, the object may be regarded as simply a method rather than an
application object in its own right.  Where it is desirable to invoke the
procedure from a number of applications, the procedure may be placed in
a separate executable module and dynamically bound to its calling applications,
thereby maintaining independence of the procedure from the applications.

<P>
A message is passed to the application object identifying the action to
be performed and providing the necessary input data.  The application object
will then typically carry out a modal dialog (or possibly a series of dialogs)
with the end user to obtain any further information, leading the user through
the necessary steps in the required order.  When the procedure has been
completed, the application object terminates the dialog and possibly passes
a message to its caller or to another application object, containing an
acknowledgement of completion, or information collected during the procedure.
 Where completion of a method is mandatory to correct execution of the application,
this acknowledgement of completion provides a useful mechanism for the caller
to determine that the method has been successfully executed.
<P>
If such procedures are correctly defined at a generic level (for example,
<I>Enter the customer data</I>), their application objects may be stored
in a library and used by multiple applications.  More complex procedures
may be constructed within an application by invoking a number of such application
objects in sequence.  Acknowledgement messages from the application objects
can be used to verify that the required steps have taken place.
<P>
Thus it can be seen that the object-oriented paradigm, when the definition
of a data object is sufficiently expanded to include all types of logical
entity, and when properly applied with correctly designed application objects
obeying the aforementioned rules and guidelines, is generally applicable
to almost all applications.  A wide variety of applications may therefore
achieve the modularization and reusability benefits afforded by an object-oriented
design approach.
