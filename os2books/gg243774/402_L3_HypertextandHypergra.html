<P>
Help windows may be nested through the use of links embedded within the
help information.  Both text and graphics may be defined as selectable;
selection of these items can then be used to trigger events such as:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Display of another help window with supporting help
text<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Dispatch of message to the application window which
invoked the help window<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Initiation of a new application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Selectable items are known as<I> links</I>; text items are <A HREF="589_L2_hypertext.html"><B>hypertext
links</B></A>, and graphical items are <A HREF="588_L2_hypergraphics.html"><B>hypergraphic
links</B></A>. Each of these link types is described in the following sections.

<P>
<B>Hypertext Links</B>
<P>
Text items are defined using the<I> :link</I> tag, which defines the type
of event triggered by the link operation, and details of the target object
activated by the link.  An example of a<I> :link</I> tag is shown in <A HREF="126_L2_HypertextLink.html">Figure
"Hypertext Link"</A>.
<P>
The<I> :link</I> tag shown in the example above uses the<I> reftype=</I> attribute
to identify the type of event to be triggered (in this case, the display
of another help window).  The<I> res=</I> attribute identifies the help
window to be displayed when the hypertext item is selected.
<P>
Different values for the reftype= attribute will trigger different types
of events:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Specifying<I> reftype=hd</I> causes the display of
another help window, as shown in <A HREF="126_L2_HypertextLink.html">Figure
"Hypertext Link"</A>.  The<I> res=</I> attribute must also be specified
in order to identify the help window to be displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Specifying<I> reftype=fn</I> causes the display of
a popup window containing a footnote.  The<I> refid=</I> attribute must
also be specified in order to identify the footnote.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Specifying<I> reftype=inform</I> causes a message
to be sent to the application window which invoked the help window.  The
<I>res=</I> attribute must also be specified, and its value is passed back
to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Specifying<I> reftype=launch</I> causes another application
to be started by the operating system.  The name of the program to be started
is specified in the<I> object=</I> attribute, and parameters may be passed
to the program in the<I> data=</I> attribute.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The use of hypertext links provides a powerful means to develop sophisticated
help text and online documentation, and to implement tutorials and "self-teaching"
applications.  This subject is discussed further in <A HREF="423_L2_SelfTeachingApplicat.html">Self-Teaching
Applications</A>.
<P>
<B>Hypergraphic Links</B>
<P>
Bitmapped graphic items are defined in a slightly different manner to text
items, using the<I> :artlink</I> tag.  The<I> :artlink</I> tag is specified
on the line immediately following the<I> :artwork</I> tag in the source
file.
<P>
Multiple<I> :artlink</I> tags may be defined for the same bitmap, in order
that the user may select different portions of the bitmap to trigger different
events.  If multiple<I> :artlink</I> tags are specified however, they must
be placed in a link file, which is referenced using the<I> linkfile=</I> attribute
to the<I> :artwork</I> tag.
<P>
Both techniques are illustrated in <A HREF="127_L2_HypergraphicLink.html">Figure
"Hypergraphic Link"</A>.
<P>
The use of a link file is mandatory where multiple hypergraphic links exist
for the same bitmap.  The format of a link file is shown in <A HREF="128_L2_LinkFileWithMultiple.html">Figure
"Link File With Multiple Hypergraphic Links"</A>.
<P>
Multiple<I> :link</I> tags are nested within a single<I> :artlink</I> tag,
and define various selectable areas of the bitmap, each of which triggers
a specific event when selected by the user.  Any of the types of events
normally triggered by a<I> :link</I> tag may be initiated from a hypergraphic
link.
