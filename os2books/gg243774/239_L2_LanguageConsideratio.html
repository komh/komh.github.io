<H1>Language Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 256 -->
<P>
Presentation Manager applications may be written using the following programming
languages:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Assembler language<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>C"<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->COBOL (OS/2 Version 1.2 and above)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->FORTRAN (OS/2 Version 1.2 and above)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The use of Assembler language should be avoided wherever possible.  While
coding to such a low-level language may provide significant performance
improvements in critical applications, it is typically more  costly in terms
of programmer productivity and subsequent code maintenance.  Assembler code
is also less portable than that written using higher-level languages.
<P>
The requirements of the Presentation Manager execution environment restrict
the use of the COBOL and FORTRAN languages.  Presentation Manager requires
window procedures to be reentrant, and neither FORTRAN nor COBOL support
the creation of reentrant code.  In addition, much of the default message
processing provided by Presentation Manager results in synchronous messages
being sent to window procedures.  This practice is effectively a recursive
subroutine call, and requires window procedures to be written in a language
that supports recursion.  Neither COBOL nor FORTRAN provide such support.

<P>
In order to create COBOL or FORTRAN source code that executes in the Presentation
Manager environment, the application developer must adopt one of two solutions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a "C" program to provide the Presentation
Manager windowing and dialog management functions, and combine this program
with called COBOL  or FORTRAN subprograms to perform the actual processing
for the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a "winproc-less" application, where a
main routine written in COBOL or FORTRAN creates a message-processing loop,
captures  and explicitly processes all message classes.  Such an application
has  no window procedures.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Use the "language support window procedure" provided
with the<I> OS/2 Programmer's Toolkit</I> under OS/2 Version 1.3, which
provides processing for most message classes and returns selected messages
to the application for processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Where the use of COBOL or FORTRAN is unavoidable, solution (1) above is
recommended, since it provides additional flexibility, maintains SAA conformance,
retains much of the object-oriented nature of the application, and allows
the best use to be made of existing host COBOL or FORTRAN application code,
since the subprograms used are invoked using standard language conventions,
and data is passed to them using a  normal parameter list and returned the
same way.  The subprograms therefore interact with the calling application
in much the same way as an ISPF dialog, minimizing the requirement for modification
of existing code and reducing the need to retrain application developers.

<P>
Object-oriented programming languages such as Smalltalk and C++ are becoming
increasingly popular for the creation of object-oriented code, and are well-suited
to the Presentation Manager application model.  Organizations may wish to
investigate the viability of these languages for particular development
projects and environments.
