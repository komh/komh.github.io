<H1>Granularity</H1><!-- entering slot 488 -->
<P>
When placing generic code in a dynamic link library, whether that code is
at the application object level or at the functional level, the question
arises as to the way in which the code should be partitioned into individual
DLL modules, and thus the level of granularity that will be achieved within
the reusable code.
<P>
This decision must be made on the basis of interdependence; where routines
are interdependent and are required or likely to be used together, it is
advisable to place them in a single dynamic link library.  For example,
a group of standard window manipulation routines would typically reside
in single DLL.
<P>
However, generic application objects should bear no predefined relationship
to one another, and generic window classes may therefore be used independently.
 In such a case, the window procedure and invoking routine for each window
class should be placed in a separate DLL, along with any subroutines specific
to that window procedure.  Applications that desire to use more than one
such application object may then access multiple DLLs.
