system

Linkage convention used in C programming under the IBM C Set/2 compiler,
which causes the compiler to generate object code for a function or subroutine,
such that parameters are placed on the stack in right-to-left order, and
the stack is cleared by the calling function when control is returned. 
The<I> system</I> linkage convention differs from the default<I> optlink
</I>linkage convention in the preservation of register values and the handling
of return values. Use of the<I> system</I> linkage convention is required
for functions that are invoked by the operating system or Presentation Manager,
such as window and dialog procedures.  The<I> system</I> linkage convention
is specified using the #pragma linkage directive.
