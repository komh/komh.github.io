<H1>Threads Containing Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 368 -->
<P>
When a secondary thread is created, and in turn creates an object window
as shown in <A HREF="084_L2_SecondaryThreadCreat.html">Figure "Secondary
Thread Creating an Object Window"</A>, the handle of the calling window
 may be passed to the object window as part of the WM_CREATE message, and
the object window procedure uses this handle to pass its own window handle
back to the calling window as part of an acknowledgement  message.  This
technique is illustrated in the sample object window procedure shown in
<A HREF="085_L2_SampleObjectWindowPr.html">Figure "Sample Object Window
Procedure"</A>.
<P>
Once the calling window receives this message and extracts the  object window's
handle, it should store the handle in its own instance  data.  It may then
use the handle at any time to pass a Presentation Manager message to the
object window, in order to initiate an event in the object window.
<P>
By convention, messages passed to an object window should contain the window
handle of the calling window, within the message  parameters.  The object
window procedure may then use this handle to pass an acknowledgement message
or return data to the calling window in the primary thread.  This technique
allows the same object window to process messages from multiple sources.
 See <A HREF="349_L2_ClientServerApplicat.html">Client-Server Applications
</A>for additional considerations.
<P>
Note that messages passed to object windows in secondary threads  should
be<I> posted</I> using the<B> WinPostMsg()</B> function,  rather than being
sent using the<B> WinSendMsg()</B> function.  This causes asynchronous processing
of the message, and allows the  primary thread to return to Presentation
Manager and continue interaction with the  end user.
<P>
In situations where the user must be prevented from carrying out  certain
actions while the object window processes an event, the calling window procedure
should disable those actions in the action bar immediately<I> before</I> posting
the message to the object window, and re-enable those actions<I> only</I> after
a completion message  has been received from the object window.  This prevents
the user from  carrying out such actions, but does not prohibit other actions
within the application, or interaction with other applications on the desktop.
