<H1>Parent/Child Relationship</H1><!-- entering slot 236 -->
<P>
The parent/child relationship between windows is mentioned in<I> OS/2 Version
2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell</I>, with regard
to the clipping of a child window to the borders of its parent. However,
this hierarchy goes further in Presentation Manager, since<I> all</I> windows,
both display windows and object windows, have a designated parent window.
For top-level display windows, this parent window is the desktop, and is
identified by the HWND_DESKTOP constant.  Other display windows within an
application, which are child windows of the application's main window, may
have the top-level application window as their parent, or indeed subsequent
levels of the window hierarchy may be created, dependent on application
requirements.  A window's parent is identified to Presentation Manager by
the application when the window is created.  Thus the window hierarchy within
a particular desktop is dynamically defined at execution time.
<P>
As well as being uniquely identified by its window handle, a child window
may also be identified by a window identifier, which is unique between children
of a particular parent window.  This identifier is an integer value, which
in practice is usually replaced by a more meaningful symbolic name that
defines an integer constant.  The window identifier is supplied as a parameter
when the application requests creation of the window by Presentation Manager.
 When a window's parent and identifier are known, the<B> WinWindowFromID()
</B>function may be used to determine its window handle so that operations
may be performed upon it.  See <A HREF="249_L2_WindowCommunication.html">Window
Communication</A> for further information.
<P>
The parent/child hierarchy is useful for application design purposes, since
in many cases, a window and its children may be regarded and manipulated
as a single unit.  For example, sizing a parent window automatically clips
all children of that window to the boundaries of the parent, and closing
a parent window results in each of its children being closed.  This simplifies
the application logic required for applications that create multiple windows.

<P>
<B>Frame and Client Windows</B>
<P>
The concepts of frame and client areas for a window are discussed in<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell</I>.  In
fact, these frame and client areas are separate windows in their own right;
the frame window of the application's "main window" is a top-level window
with the desktop as its parent, and the client window is a child of the
frame window.  Frame control windows such as maximize/minimize icons, the
title bar, the menu bar, etc., are also separate windows from the application
viewpoint, and are regarded as children of the frame window.  Note that
although they are separate windows, the end user perceives and manipulates
the entire group as a single unit.
<P>
The frame window and its children all belong to system-defined generic window
classes, and thus have their own window procedures defined by Presentation
Manager.  The exception is the client window, the window class of which
is defined by the application; the window procedure is therefore defined
to Presentation Manager when the window class is registered.  Note that
window procedures for system-defined window classes may be subclassed by
the application in order to provide specialized processing of certain messages.

<P>
The children of a frame window have specific window identifiers assigned
to them by Presentation Manager.  These window identifiers are unique for
each frame window.  The predefined window identifiers are shown in <A HREF="139_L2_WindowIdentifiers.html">Table
"Window Identifiers"</A>.
<P>
These identifiers may be used to communicate with child windows of a particular
frame window, without the necessity to determine the window handle of the
child window.  This concept is applicable to all windows including control
windows within a dialog box.  See <A HREF="249_L2_WindowCommunication.html">Window
Communication</A> for further information.
<P>
<B>Object Windows</B>
<P>
Object windows do not have a parent in the visual sense, as considerations
such as clipping do not arise (since the window is never displayed).  For
the purposes of standardization, Presentation Manager considers every object
window to have a conceptual parent; this parent may be referenced using
the constant HWND_OBJECT.  This technique allows an object window to be
created using the same Presentation Manager function as that used to create
a display window.  It is also useful in<!-- entering slot 237 --> allowing
logical grouping of windows with similar functions, or which need to be
treated as a group for application purposes, under a single conceptual parent.

<P>
For example, all the object windows created by a particular application
may be grouped as children of a single "dummy" parent window.  When the
application terminates and wishes to destroy all these windows, only a single
function call to destroy the parent need be issued; Presentation Manager
will automatically destroy each of the children in turn before destroying
the parent.  Due to the way in which Presentation Manager destroys windows
by first passing a WM_DESTROY message to the window, each object window
is given a chance to exit in an orderly manner.
