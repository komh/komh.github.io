<H1>Implementing a Private Rendering Mechanism</H1><!-- entering slot 337 -->
<P>
The<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming Guide Volume II</I> gives some advice on use
of the various messages available to implement a private rendering mechanism,
and also some guidelines on how such a rendering mechanism should be documented.
 This section illustrates the implementation of a simple rendering mechanism,
by explaining the definition of the DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism used
by the examples earlier in this chapter.
<P>
A rendering mechanism is necessary to pass the customer record data used
in the examples, since the CUSTOMER structure that contains this data is
too large to be contained within the DRAGITEM structure. It is therefore
necessary, after a drop has occurred, for the source program to make the
relevant data available to the target, in a format which is understood by
and accessible to both the source and the target.  In the examples, a named
shared memory object is used to transfer the data; hence the name DRM_SHAREMEM
used for the rendering mechanism.
<P>
The DRM_SHAREMEM rendering mechanism operates as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The source window stores a pointer to the customer
record being dragged in the<I> ulItemID</I> field of the DRAGITEM structure.
 This field is defined as ULONG, but it can be used in any way that is meaningful
to the source window to identify the item being dragged.  A pointer to the
customer record is a convenient way to do this.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The target window, on receiving a DM_DROP message,
allocates a named shared memory object with a name of its choice.  It then
sends a DM_RENDER message to the source window, passing the name of the
memory object in the<I> hstrRenderToName</I> field of the DRAGTRANSFER structure,
and indicating whether it requires a copy (DO_COPY) or a move (DO_MOVE)
to take place, using the usOperation field of the DRAGTRANSFER structure.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->When the source window receives the DM_RENDER message,
it obtains access to the shared memory object and places the customer record
in that object.  The source window knows which customer record to copy,
since the DRAGITEM structure, which includes a pointer to the customer record,
is passed along with the DRAGTRANSFER structure.
<P>
Finally, if a move operation was requested by the target, the source window
deletes the customer record from its own data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->On receiving a TRUE return code from the DM_RENDER
message, indicating that the data was successfully rendered, the target
window copies the data out of the shared memory object, and uses it in whatever
way it chooses.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
It should be stressed that this is a very simple rendering mechanism. However,
it illustrates the general structure of such mechanisms, and their impact
on the contents of fields in the DRAGITEM and DRAGTRANSFER structures.
