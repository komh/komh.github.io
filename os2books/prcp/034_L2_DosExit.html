<P>
DosExit allows a thread to terminate itself or be terminated by another
thread in its process. If ActionCode=0 and the specified thread is the last
thread executing in the process, or if ActionCode=1, the process terminates.

<P>
The system can start threads on behalf of an application. Thus, if the intent
of a DosExit call is to terminate the process, ActionCode=1 should be specified
to terminate all the threads belonging to the process.
<P>
Do not terminate thread 1 without terminating the process. Thread 1 is the
initial thread of execution, not a thread started by a <A HREF="020_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
</A>request.  When thread 1 ends, any monitors or signal processing routines
set for this process also end. To avoid unpredictable results, DosExit should
be specified with ActionCode=1 to ensure the process ends.
<P>
When a process is terminating, all but one thread is terminated and that
thread executes routines whose addresses have been specified with <A HREF="036_L2_DosExitList.html">DosExitList</A>.
 After resources have been cleaned up by the exit list routines, this thread
and all other resources owned by the process are released.
<P>

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode.
 Therefore, the following restrictions apply to DosExit when coding for
the DOS mode:
<P>
There is no thread support in DOS 3.3; therefore DosExit exits the currently
executing program.
<P>
If ActionCode = 0 this option is ignored.  It is equivalent to an ActionCode
= 1.
