call returns. This state of the file defines it as a synchronous file. For

requires the cooperation of sharing processes. This cooperation is communicated

<UL> Specify the type of access other
processes may have to the file (sharing mode). For example, if it is permissible
for other processes to continue reading the file while your process is operating
on it, specify Deny Write.  This sharing mode prevents other processes from
writing to the file but still allows them to read it.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

has already opened the file with a sharing mode of Deny None, your DosOpen
request succeeds. However, if the file is open with a sharing mode of Deny
Write, your process is denied access.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
A successful DosOpen request for a file returns a handle to access the file.
The read/write pointer is set at the first byte of the file. The pointer's
position may be changed by a <A HREF="010_L2_DosChgFilePtr.html">DosChgFilePtr
</A>request or by read and write operations on the file.
<P>
The file's date and time can be queried by calling <A HREF="111_L2_DosQFileInfo.html">DosQFileInfo</A>,
and set by calling <A HREF="144_L2_DosSetFileInfo.html">DosSetFileInfo</A>.

<P>
FileAttribute sets attribute bits for the file object. Attributes of an
existing file can be queried and set by <A HREF="112_L2_DosQFileMode.html">DosQFileMode
</A>and <A HREF="145_L2_DosSetFileMode.html">DosSetFileMode</A>. A file's
read-only attribute may also be set with the OS/2 ATTRIB command.
<P>
FileAttribute cannot be set to Volume Label.  Volume labels cannot be opened.
 <A HREF="146_L2_DosSetFSInfo.html">DosSetFSInfo</A> may be issued with
a logical drive number to set volume label information.
<P>
The FileSize parameter affects the size<!-- entering slot 110 -->  of the
file only when the file is a new file or a replacement for an existing one.
If an existing file is simply opened, FileSize is ignored. <A HREF="090_L2_DosNewSize.html">DosNewSize
</A>may be called to change the existing file's size.
<P>
The value in FileSize is a recommended size for the file. If allocation
of the full size fails, the open may still succeed. The file system makes
a reasonable attempt to allocate the new size in as nearly contiguous an
area as possible on the medium. When the file size is extended, the value
of the new bytes is undefined.
<P>
The DASD Open bit provides direct access to an entire disk or diskette volume,
independent of the file system.  This mode of opening the volume currently
mounted on the drive returns a handle to the caller, which represents the
logical volume as a single file. The caller specifies this handle with a
<A HREF="024_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl</A> Category 8 Function 0
request to block other processes from accessing the logical volume.
<P>
The file handle state bits can be set by the DosOpen and <A HREF="143_L2_DosSetFHandState.html">DosSetFHandState
</A>requests.  An application can query the file handle state bits as well
as the rest of the Open Mode field, by calling <A HREF="110_L2_DosQFHandState.html">DosQFHandState</A>.
If a program running with the NEWFILES bit set tries to create or replace
a file with blanks immediately preceding the dot on a FAT drive, the system
rejects the name.  For example, if c: is a FAT drive, the name "file .txt"
is rejected and the name "file.txt" is accepted.

<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosOpen opens the client end of a pipe by name and returns a handle.  The
open succeeds only if the pipe is in a listening state; otherwise, the open
returns with ERROR_PIPE_BUSY. The pipe can be busy because of the following
reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>All instances of the pipe are already open.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The pipe is closed but is not yet disconnected
by the serving end.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>No <A HREF="015_L2_DosConnectNmPipe.html">DosConnectNmPipe
</A>is issued against the pipe after it is disconnected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Once a given instance has been opened by a client, that same instance cannot
be opened by another client at the same time.  Pipes can only be two-ended;
however, the opening process can duplicate the open handle as many times
as desired.
<P>
Pipes are always opened with the pipe-specific states set to B = 0 (to block
reads/writes) and RR = 00 (read the pipe as a byte stream).  The client
can change these modes by calling <A HREF="148_L2_DosSetNmPHandState.html">DosSetNmPHandState
</A>if desired.
<P>
The access and sharing<!-- entering slot 111 -->  modes specified on the
open must be consistent with those specified on the <A HREF="078_L2_DosMakeNmPipe.html">DosMakeNmPipe
</A>request.
