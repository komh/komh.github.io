<P>
The server process, which creates the named pipe with <A HREF="078_L2_DosMakeNmPipe.html">DosMakeNmPipe</A>,
prepares the pipe so that it can accept a <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen
</A>from a client.  To prepare the pipe for its first client, the server
issues DosConnectNmPipe.  To prepare the pipe for the next client, the server
issues <A HREF="026_L2_DosDisConnectNmPipe.html">DosDisConnectNmPipe</A> followed
by DosConnectNmPipe.
<P>
When DosConnectNmPipe returns, the pipe is in a listening state. A <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen
</A>to a pipe that is not in a listening state fails.  A client can determine
the pipe's state by issuing <A HREF="095_L2_DosPeekNmPipe.html">DosPeekNmPipe</A>.

<P>
If the client end of the pipe is currently open, DosConnectNmPipe returns
immediately and has no effect. If the client end is not open, DosConnectNmPipe
either waits until it is open (if blocking mode is set) or else returns
immediately with ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED (if non-blocking mode is set).
In the case where ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED is returned, the pipe enters
a listening state, permitting a client to issue a successful <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.

<P>
If the pipe has been closed by a previous client but is not disconnected
by the server, DosConnectNmPipe always returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.  Multiple
DosConnectNmPipe calls can be issued in non-blocking mode; the first one
puts the pipe into a listening state (if it is not already open or closing),
and subsequent ones simply test the pipe state.
<P>
If DosConnectNmPipe is called by the client end of the pipe, ERROR_BAD_PIPE
is returned.  If the wait (in blocking mode only) for the client open is
interrupted, the ERROR_INTERRUPT is returned.
