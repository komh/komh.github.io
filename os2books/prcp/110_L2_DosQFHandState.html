Open flag:
<P>
0 = PathName represents a file to be opened in the normal way.

<UL> Write-Through
flag:
<P>
0 = Writes to the file may be run through the file system buffer cache.

<P>
1 = Writes to the file may go through the file system buffer cache but the
sectors are written (actual file I/O completed) before a synchronous write
call returns. This state of the file defines it as a synchronous file. For
synchronous files, this is a mandatory bit in that the data must be written
out to the medium for synchronous write operations.

<UL>Fail-Errors flag. Media I/O errors are handled as
follows:
<P>
0 = Reported through the system critical error handler.
<P>
1 = Reported directly to the caller by return code.
<P>
Media I/O errors generated through an IOCTL Category 8 function always get
reported directly to the caller by return code.  The Fail-Errors function
applies only to non-IOCTL handle-based file I/O calls.

<P>
0 = It is advisable for the disk driver to cache the data in I/O operations
on this file.
<P>
1 = I/O to the file need not be done through the disk driver cache.
<P>
This bit is an advisory bit, and is used to advise FSDs and device drivers
on whether it is worth caching the data. This bit, like the write-through
bit, is a per-handle bit.

<P>
When a critical error occurs that the application cannot handle, it may
reset critical error handling to be performed by the system. This is done
by calling <A HREF="143_L2_DosSetFHandState.html">DosSetFHandState</A> to
turn off the fail/errors bit and then reissuing the I/O call. The expected
critical error reoccurs, and control is passed to the system critical error
handler. The precise time that the effect of this function is visible at
the application level is unpredictable when asynchronous I/O is pending.

<P>
The DASD Open bit parameter is the "Direct I/O flag." It provides an access
mechanism to a disk or diskette volume independent<!-- entering slot 136 -->
of the file system.  This mode should only be used by systems programs and
not by application programs.
