of parameters to the program name. The second ASCIIZ string is followed
by an additional byte of zeros. A value of 0 for the address of ArgPointer

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
The target program is located and loaded into storage if necessary.  A process
is created and executed for the target program.  The new process is created
with an address space separate from its parent; that is, a new Local Descriptor
Table (LDT) is built for the process.
<P>
The execution of a child process can be synchronous or asynchronous to the
execution of its parent process. If synchronous execution is indicated,
the requesting thread waits pending completion of the child process.  Other
threads in the requesting process may continue to run.
<P>
If asynchronous execution is indicated, DosExecPgm returns with the process
ID of the started child process. Specifying ExecFlags=2 allows the parent
process to issue a <A HREF="021_L2_DosCwait.html">DosCwait</A> request after
the DosExecPgm request, so it can examine the result code returned when
the child process terminates. If ExecFlags=1 is specified, the result code
of the asynchronous child process is not returned to the parent process.

<P>
A child process inherits file handles obtained by its parent with <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen
</A>calls that indicated inheritance<!-- entering slot 38 --> .  The child
process also inherits handles to pipes created by the parent process with
<A HREF="079_L2_DosMakePipe.html">DosMakePipe</A>.
<P>
Because a child process has the ability to inherit handles and a parent
process controls the meanings of handles for standard I/O, the parent can
duplicate inherited handles as handles for standard I/O. This permits the
parent process and the child process to coordinate I/O to a pipe or a file.

<P>
For example, a parent process can create two pipes with <A HREF="079_L2_DosMakePipe.html">DosMakePipe
</A>requests.  It can issue <A HREF="027_L2_DosDupHandle.html">DosDupHandle
</A>to redefine the read handle of one pipe as standard input (0000H), and
the write handle of the other pipe as standard output (0001H).  The child
process uses the standard I/O handles, and the parent process uses the remaining
read and write pipe handles.  Thus, the child process reads what the parent
writes to one pipe, and the parent process reads what the child writes to
the other pipe.
<P>
When an inherited file handle is duplicated, the position of the file pointer
is always the same for both handles, regardless of which handle repositions
the file pointer.
<P>
An asynchronous process started with ExecFlags=3 or ExecFlags=6 is provided
a trace flag facility.  This facility and the Ptrace buffer provided by
<A HREF="104_L2_DosPtrace.html">DosPtrace</A> enable a debugger to perform
breakpoint debugging.  <A HREF="161_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession
</A>provides additional debugging capabilities that allow a debugger to
trace all processes associated with an application running in a child session,
regardless of whether the process is started with a DosExecPgm or a <A HREF="161_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession
</A>request.
<P>
A detached process is treated as an orphan of the parent process and executes
in the background.  Thus, it cannot make any VIO, KBD, or MOU calls, except
within a video pop-up requested by VioPopUp. To test whether a program is
running detached, use the following method.  Issue a video call, (for example,
VioGetAnsi).  If the call is not issued within a video pop-up and the process
is detached, the video call returns error code ERROR_VIO_DETACHED.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the target program's entry point is in a segment that has
IOPL indicated, this causes a general protection fault and the process is
terminated. If any dynamic link module being used by the new process has
an initialization routine specified in a segment that has IOPL indicated,
general protection fault occurs and the process is terminated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in DOS mode than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore,
the following restrictions apply to DosExecPgm when coding in DOS mode:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>ExecFlags must be set to zero.  This value is not
related to the PID of the program being executed. If ExecFlags &lt;&gt;
0, DosExecPgm returns the error code ERROR_INVALID_DATA.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The
ObjNameBuf field is used to provide additional information in the OS/2 mode
environment as to why the DosExecPgm failed.  The information is not relevant
or available in DOS 2.X or DOS 3.X. Therefore, the buffer is filled in with
blanks.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The ReturnCodes
two-word structure is very similar to the OS/2 mode environment. The first
word is a termination code with the following meanings:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>

<UL> Termination by Ctrl<!-- entering slot 39 --> -Break.

<P>
The second word contains the ResultCode specified by the terminating process
on its <A HREF="034_L2_DosExit.html">DosExit</A> call (or INT 21H AH=4CH
call).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Application Type Considerations</B>
<P>
You may use DosExecPgm to start a process that is of the same type as the
starting process. Process types include Presentation Manager, text-windowed,
and full-screen. You may not use DosExecPgm to start a process that is of
a different type than the starting process.
<P>
You must use DosStartSession to start a new process from a process that
is of a different type. For example, use DosStartSession to start a Presentation
Manager process from a non-Presentation Manager process.
