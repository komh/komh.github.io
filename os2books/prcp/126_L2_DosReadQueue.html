<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Address of a data field that returns the following
information.
<P>
The first word is the PID of the process that added the element to the queue.

<P>
The second word is used for event encoding by the application. The data
in this word is the same as that furnished by the Request parameter on the
<A HREF="175_L2_DosWriteQueue.html">DosWriteQueue</A> request for the corresponding
queue element.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> DataLength</B> (PUSHORT) - output
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Address of the length of the data being received.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Address
of the element being received from the queue.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ElementCode
</B>(USHORT) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Overrides the normal priority,
FIFO-, or LIFO-read ordering.  This operand is used to identify a specific
element that is to be read. This field can be set to zero to read the first
element in the queue, or it can contain an identifier for a particular element,
which was returned to ElementCode by a <A HREF="096_L2_DosPeekQueue.html">DosPeekQueue
</A>request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NoWait</B> (UCHAR) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Action

<UL> The requesting thread does not wait.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ElemPriority
</B>(PBYTE) - output<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Address of the element's priority.
 This is the value that was specified for ElemPriority by the <A HREF="175_L2_DosWriteQueue.html">DosWriteQueue
</A>call that added the element to the queue. ElemPriority is a numeric
value in the range of 0 to 15, with 15 being the highest priority.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> SemaphoreHandle
</B>(HSEM) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Handle of the semaphore cleared
when an element is written to the queue and NoWait=0 is specified. If NoWait=1
is specified, this parameter should be set to null.
<P>
The semaphore can be either a RAM or system semaphore. If the semaphore
is a RAM semaphore, it must be in a segment that is shared between the process
that owns the queue and any process that issues a <A HREF="175_L2_DosWriteQueue.html">DosWriteQueue
</A>request to the queue.
<P>
If multiple threads are processing elements from the queue using NoWait=0,
the same semaphore must be provided on all <A HREF="096_L2_DosPeekQueue.html">DosPeekQueue
</A>or DosReadQueue requests.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
A process that creates a queue with <A HREF="018_L2_DosCreateQueue.html">DosCreateQueue
</A>owns it. Only the owning process and any threads it creates can issue
DosReadQueue to remove an element from the queue. If the queue is empty
and NoWait = 0 is specified, the thread waits for an element to be written
to the queue. If the queue is empty and NoWait = 1 is specified, the thread
returns with ERROR_QUE_EMPTY.
<P>
If ElementCode is set to zero, the elements in the queue are removed in
the order specified at the time of the queue's creation (FIFO, LIFO, or
priority).
<P>
ElementCode can also be set to a value returned by <A HREF="096_L2_DosPeekQueue.html">DosPeekQueue</A>,
which uses ElementCode to return identifiers for successive queue elements.
 The assigning of identifiers by <A HREF="096_L2_DosPeekQueue.html">DosPeekQueue
</A>to individual queue elements allows the queue owner to examine a queue
element with <A HREF="096_L2_DosPeekQueue.html">DosPeekQueue</A> and compare
it with a queue element it has read.
<P>
The semaphore provided by SemaphoreHandle is typically used by a <A HREF="089_L2_DosMuxSemWait.html">DosMuxSemWait
</A>request to wait for an element to be written to a queue or other events.
If DosReadQueue is issued with NoWait=0, it clears the semaphore indicated
by SemaphoreHandle as soon as the element is read.
<P>
The Request, DataLength and DataAddress parameters contain data understood
by the thread adding the element to the queue and by the thread that receives
the queue element. There is no special meaning to this data; applications
may use these parameters for any purpose they wish. OS/2 does not alter
this data; it simply copies this data intact. OS/2 does not validate the
address of DataBuffer or the DataLength.
