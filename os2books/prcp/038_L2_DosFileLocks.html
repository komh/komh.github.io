<P>
DosFileLocks provides a mechanism that allows a process to lock a region
in a file for read/write access. The time a region is locked should be short.

<P>
Instead of denying another process read/write access to the entire file
by means of access and sharing modes specified with <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen
</A>or <A HREF="092_L2_DosOpen2.html">DosOpen2</A> requests, a process attempts
to lock only the the range needed for read/write access and examines the
error code returned.
<P>
A range to be locked must first be cleared of any locked subranges or overlapping
ranges. The locked region can be located anywhere in the file, and locking
beyond end-of-file is not considered an error.
<P>
Once a lock is successful, read/write access by another process to the specified
range is denied until the range is unlocked. If both unlocking and locking
are specified by a DosFileLocks request, the unlocking operation is performed
first. After unlocking is completed, locking is done.
<P>
Duplicating the handle duplicates access to any locked regions; however,
access to locked regions is not duplicated across the <A HREF="033_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>call.
<P>
If a file is closed (either by a <A HREF="012_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose
</A>request or by a process terminating) and locks are still in effect,
the locks are released in no defined order.
<P>

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore,
the following restrictions apply to DosFileLocks when coding for the DOS
mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>If Block = 1 is specified, an "invalid range lock
list" or "invalid unlock list" error is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>NewLockIDList is not supported.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
