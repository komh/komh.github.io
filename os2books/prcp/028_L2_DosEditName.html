<P>
DosEditName is used to search for and edit names of files and subdirectories.
 This call is typically used in conjunction with calls like <A HREF="088_L2_DosMove.html">DosMove
</A>and <A HREF="016_L2_DosCopy.html">DosCopy</A>, which do not permit the
use of global file name characters, to perform repetitive operations on
files.
<P>
As an example of an editing operation, a SourceString of "foo.bar" specified
with an EditString of "*.baz" results in "FOO.BAZ" being returned. In the
editing process, the string is changed to uppercase.
<P>
Global file name characters have two sets of semantics; one for searching
and one for editing. If they are specified in SourceString, they are interpreted
as search characters.  If they are specified in EditString, they are interpreted
as editing characters.
<P>
Use of the OS/2 COPY utility illustrates this difference in semantics. For
example, if a user enters:
<PRE>copy *.old *.new
</PRE>
In the source, the "*" acts as a search character and determines which files
to return to the user.  In the target, the "*" functions as an editing character
by constructing new names for the matched files.
<P>
When used as search characters in SourceString, global file name characters
simply match files and behave like any other search characters. They have
the following meanings:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "." has no special meaning itself but "?" gives
it one.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "*" matches 0 or more characters, any character,
including a blank. The matching operation does not cross the null character
or the backslash (\), which means only the file name is matched, not an
entire path.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "?" matches 1 character, unless what it would
match is a "." or the terminating null characters, in which case it matches
0 characters.  It also doesn't cross "\".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
Any character other than * and ? matches itself, including ".".
<P>
Searching is case-insensitive.
<P>
Any file name that does not have a period (.) in it gets an implicit one
automatically appended to the end during searching operations.  For example,
searching for "foo." would return "foo".
<P>
When used as editing characters in EditString, global file name characters
have the following meanings:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "." has a special meaning for editing.  The "."
in the target synchronizes pointers.  It causes the source pointer to match
a corresponding pointer to the "." in the target.  Counting starts from
the left of the pointers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "?" copies one character, unless what it would
copy is a ".", in which case it copies 0.  It also copies 0 characters when
the end of the source string is reached.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The "*" copies characters from the source to the target
until it finds a source character that matches the character following it
in the target.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
Editing is case-insensitive and case-preserving.  If conflicts arise between
the case of the source and editing string, the case of the editing string
is used. For example:
<PRE>source string:      "file.txt"
editing string:     "*E.TMP"
destination string: "filE.TMP"

copy file.txt  *E.tmp  -&gt;  filE.tmp
</PRE>
