GEAList is a packed array of variable length "get EA" structures, each containing
an EA name and the length of the name.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B> fpFEAList
</B>(PFEALIST)<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL> Address of FEAList. FEAList is a
packed array of variable length "full EA" structures, each containing an
EA name and its corresponding value, as well as the lengths of the name
and the value.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<P>
On input, the fpGEAList field and oError fields are ignored.  The EA setting
operation is performed on the information contained in FEAList. If extended
attributes are not to be defined or modified, then EABuf must be set to
null.  Following is the FEAList format:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL>If bit 7 is set to 1, this indicates a critical

not essential to the intended use by an application of the file with which
it is associated.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

 If an error occurred during the set, oError is the offset of the FEA where
the error occurred.  The API return code is the error code corresponding
to the condition generating the error.  If no error occurred, oError is
undefined.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
DosMkDir2 allows an application to define extended attributes for a subdirectory
at the time of its creation.
<P>
If any subdirectory names in the path do not exist, the subdirectory is
not created. Upon return, a subdirectory is created at the end of the specified
path.
<P>
<A HREF="120_L2_DosQSysInfo.html">DosQSysInfo</A> must be used by an application
to determine the maximum path length supported by OS/2.  The returned value
should be used to dynamically allocate buffers that are to be used to store
paths.
<P>
If a program<!-- entering slot 99 -->  running with the NEWFILES bit set
tries to create a directory with blanks immediately preceding the dot on
a FAT drive, the system rejects the name.  For example, if c: is a FAT drive,
the name "file .txt" is rejected and the name "file.txt" is accepted.
