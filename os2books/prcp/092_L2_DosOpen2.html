call returns. This state of the file defines it as a synchronous file. For
synchronous files, this is a mandatory bit in that the data must be written

Media I/O errors generated through an IOCTL Category 8 function always get

<UL> Specify the type of access other
processes may have to the file (sharing mode). For example, if it is permissible
for other processes to continue reading the file while your process is operating
on it, specify Deny Write.  This sharing mode prevents other processes from
writing to the file but still allows them to read it.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B> Access

For example, if your process requires Read/Write access, and another process
has already opened the file with a sharing mode of Deny None, your DosOpen2
request succeeds. However, if the file is open with a sharing mode of Deny
Write, your process is denied access.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
A successful DosOpen2 request for a file returns a handle to access the
file. The read/write pointer is set at the first byte of the file. The pointer's
position may be changed by a <A HREF="010_L2_DosChgFilePtr.html">DosChgFilePtr
</A>request or by read and write operations on the file.
<P>
The file's date and time can be queried by calling <A HREF="111_L2_DosQFileInfo.html">DosQFileInfo</A>,
and is set by calling <A HREF="144_L2_DosSetFileInfo.html">DosSetFileInfo</A>.

<P>
FileAttribute sets attribute bits for the file object. Attributes of an
existing file can be queried and set by <A HREF="112_L2_DosQFileMode.html">DosQFileMode
</A>and <A HREF="145_L2_DosSetFileMode.html">DosSetFileMode</A>. A file's
read-only attribute may also be set with the OS/2 ATTRIB command.
<P>
FileAttribute cannot be set to Volume Label.  Volume labels cannot be opened.
 <A HREF="146_L2_DosSetFSInfo.html">DosSetFSInfo</A> may be issued with
a logical drive number to set volume label information.
<P>
The FileSize parameter affects the size of the file only when the file is
a new file or a replacement for an existing one. If an existing file is
simply opened, FileSize is ignored. <A HREF="090_L2_DosNewSize.html">DosNewSize
</A>may be called to change the existing file's size.
<P>
The value in FileSize is a recommended size for the file. If allocation
of the full size fails, the open may still succeed. The file system makes
a reasonable attempt to allocate the new size in as nearly contiguous an
area as possible on the medium. When the file size is extended, the value
of the new bytes is undefined.
<P>
The DASD Open bit provides direct access to an entire disk or diskette volume,
independent of the file system.  This mode of opening the volume currently
mounted on the drive returns a handle to the caller, which represents the
logical volume as a single file. The caller specifies this handle with a
<A HREF="024_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl</A> Category 8 Function 0
request to block other processes from accessing the logical volume.
<P>
The file handle state bits can be set by the DosOpen2 and <A HREF="143_L2_DosSetFHandState.html">DosSetFHandState
<!-- entering slot 115 --></A> requests.  An application can query the file
handle state bits as well as the rest of the Open Mode field, by calling
<A HREF="110_L2_DosQFHandState.html">DosQFHandState</A>.
<P>
Extended attributes can be set by an EAOP structure in EABuf when creating
a file, replacing an existing file, or truncating an existing file. No extended
attributes are set when simply opening an existing file.
<P>
A replace operation is logically equivalent to atomically deleting and re-creating
the file.  This means that any extended attributes associated with the file
are also deleted before the file is re-created.
