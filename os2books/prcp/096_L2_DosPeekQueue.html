</B>(ULONG) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Handle of a semaphore to be
cleared when the queue has data placed into it and NoWait=0 is specified.
If NoWait=1 is specified, this parameter should be set to null.
<P>
The semaphore may be either a RAM or system semaphore. If this handle is
for a RAM semaphore, that semaphore must be in a segment shared between
the process that owns the queue and any process that issues a <A HREF="175_L2_DosWriteQueue.html">DosWriteQueue
</A>request to the queue.
<P>
If multiple threads are processing elements from the queue using a NoWait=0,
the same semaphore must be provided on all DosPeekQueue or <A HREF="126_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
A process that creates a queue with <A HREF="018_L2_DosCreateQueue.html">DosCreateQueue
</A>owns it. Only the owning process and any threads it creates can issue
DosPeekQueue to examine a queue element without removing it from the queue.
 If the queue is empty and NoWait=0 is specified, the thread waits for an
element to be added to the queue. If the queue is empty and NoWait=1 is
specified, the thread returns with ERROR_QUE_EMPTY.
<P>
The ElementCode parameter returns an indicator for the element being examined.
To examine the first element in the queue, the queue owner issues DosPeekQueue
with ElementCode set to zero. To examine the next element in the queue,
the queue owner uses the value returned in ElementCode as input for the
next DosPeekQueue request, and so on.  By issuing successive peeks, the
queue owner can select a queue element and then remove it from the queue
by specifying an ElementCode value with a <A HREF="126_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>request.
<P>
The semaphore provided by SemaphoreHandle is typically used with a <A HREF="089_L2_DosMuxSemWait.html">DosMuxSemWait
</A>request to wait for a queue or any of several other events. If <A HREF="126_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>is issued with NoWait=0, it clears the semaphore indicated by SemaphoreHandle
as soon as the element is peeked.
<P>
The Request, DataLength and DataBuffer parameters contain data understood
by the thread adding the element to the queue and by the thread that receives
the queue element. There is no special meaning to this data; applications
may use these parameters for any purpose they wish. OS/2 does not alter
this data; it simply copies this data intact. OS/2 does not validate the
address of DataBuffer or the DataLength.
