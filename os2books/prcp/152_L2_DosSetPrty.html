<P>
This call allows a process to change the priority of all the threads of
any process; or all the threads of the current process or a child process,
as well as any descendants; or a single thread within the current process.
When a process changes the priority of threads in other processes, only
default priorities are changed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The OS/2 scheduler has a concept of priority classes and levels.  DosSetPrty
allows threads to move between classes in response to changes in their execution
environments. Within each class, a thread's priority level can vary because
of a DosSetPrty request or action taken by the system. System-initiated
priority variation is performed as a combination of a specific thread's
actions and the overall system activity.
<P>
A time-critical thread has the highest priority class and executes before
any fixed-high, regular, or idle-time threads. A fixed-high thread has a
priority class that is lower than time-critical but executes before any
regular or idle-time threads.
<P>
Time-critical threads have static priorities that are not varied by OS/2.
 Threads are scheduled in priority order, with round-robin scheduling of
threads of equal priority.
<P>
For each of the four priority classes, there are 32 distinct priority levels,
0 to +31. Whenever DosSetPrty is issued with a class specification, but
no value is specified for PriorityDelta, the base priority level defaults
to zero.
<P>
The priority level of a process consists of a computed priority value that
is based upon the display status (foreground or background) of the process,
its recent I/O and processor time-usage history, and other factors. The
signed value specified in PriorityDelta is added to the computed priority
to produce the actual priority used by the scheduler. The result is restricted
to the valid range, based upon the current priority class.
<P>
Specifying a higher priority delta allows a thread to obtain better processor
scheduling than it normally would.  A lower priority delta gives the thread
less processor resource than it normally receives.
<P>
When used with PriorityClass to change to a different class, the delta value
applies to the base priority. A new base level of 0 is assigned the target
thread and any PriorityDelta specified is relative to zero.
<P>
A process can change the priority of any thread within its current process.
However, when a process changes the priority of threads in another process,
only those with default priorities are changed. The priority of any thread
in another process that has explicitly changed its priority from the default
with DosSetPrty is not changed.
<P>
The initial thread of execution for an application is given a regular class
priority that varies by the system. A thread started with <A HREF="020_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
<!-- entering slot 187 --></A> inherits the priority of the thread in the
process that creates it. A child process started by a <A HREF="033_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>call inherits the priority of the thread in the parent process that
creates it.
