For a RAM semaphore, this reference is the address of a doubleword of storage,
allocated and initialized to zero by the application. This sets the semaphore
as unowned. Other than initializing the doubleword to zero, an application

<P>
Typically, DosSemRequest is called to set a semaphore for the purpose of
accessing a protected resource. DosSemRequest checks the status of the semaphore.
 If the semaphore is not set (that is, not owned) by another thread, DosSemRequest
sets the semaphore as owned by the current thread and returns immediately
to the caller.
<P>
If the semaphore is already owned by another thread, DosSemRequest optionally
can block the requesting thread until the semaphore becomes available. The
unblocking of a thread blocked by a DosSemRequest is level-triggered. That
is, DosSemRequest does not return until the semaphore remains clear long
enough for the affected thread to be redispatched and successfully claim
the semaphore. Thus, if a number of threads are blocked indefinitely on
DosSemRequest calls for the semaphore, only the thread that sets the semaphore
is actually unblocked. If a milliseconds value is specified for the Timeout
parameter, this places an upper limit on the amount of time the requesting
thread remains blocked, waiting for the semaphore to become available.
<P>
When a thread no longer requires the protected resource, it issues <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear
</A>to clear the semaphore, so another thread may claim it with a successful
DosSemRequest. If the semaphore is an exclusive system semaphore, it has
a use count associated with it, which is incremented by a DosSemRequest
and decremented by a <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear</A>.
The semaphore is not actually cleared and made available to the next thread
that wants to access the resource until the semaphore has been cleared the
same number of times it has been requested. This means that exclusive system
semaphores can be used in recursive routines.  When the use count is 0,
the semaphore is available to be claimed by the next user of the protected
resource.
<P>
If a process terminates while owning a nonexclusive system semaphore, ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED
is returned to the thread that next gets the semaphore through DosSemRequest.
That thread takes steps to ensure the integrity of the resource.  The thread
can release the resource by issuing a <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear</A>,
or it can reset the ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED return code condition flagged in
the semaphore data structure.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To request a Fast-Safe RAM semaphore, a thread calls <A HREF="050_L2_DosFSRamSemRequest.html">DosFSRamSemRequest</A>.
