<UL> Write-Through
flag:  The file is opened as follows:
<P>
0 = Write-behind to remote pipes is allowed.
<P>
1 = Write-behind to remote pipes is not allowed.
<P>
Setting the Write-Through flag is meaningful only for a remote pipe. Occasionally,
data written to a remote pipe is buffered locally and then sent across the
network to the pipe at a later time. Setting the Write-Through bit ensures
that data is sent to the remote pipe as soon as it is written.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> Blocking
flag:  The pipe is defined as follows:
<P>
0 = Reads/Writes block if no data available.
<P>
1 = Reads/Writes return immediately if no data available.
<P>
Reads normally block until at least partial data can be returned.  Writes
by default block until all bytes requested have been written.  Non-blocking
mode (1) changes this behavior as follows:
<P>
<A HREF="124_L2_DosRead.html">DosRead</A> returns immediately with error
NO_DATA if no data is available.
<P>
<A HREF="173_L2_DosWrite.html">DosWrite</A> returns immediately with BytesWritten

<UL> Type
of named pipe:  The pipe is defined as follows:
<P>
0 = Pipe is a byte stream pipe.
<P>
1 = Pipe is a message stream pipe.
<P>
All writes to message stream pipes record the length of the write along
with the written data (see <A HREF="173_L2_DosWrite.html">DosWrite</A>).
 The first two bytes of each message represents the length of that message
and is called the message header.  A header of all zeros is reserved.  Zero
length messages are not allowed (OS/2 no-ops zero-length I/Os).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL>Read mode:  The pipe is defined as follows:
<P>
0 = Read pipe as a byte stream.
<P>
1 = Read pipe as a message stream.
<P>
Message pipes can be read as byte or message streams, depending on this
bit.  Byte pipes can only be read as byte streams (see <A HREF="124_L2_DosRead.html">DosRead</A>)

</UL>7-0<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> ICount field (Instance
count):  Byte wide (8-bit) count to control pipe instances.  When making
the first instance of a named pipe, ICount specifies how many instances
can be created. Instances are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> Value
<!-- lm: 0x12 27 -->
<UL>Definition<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> 1<!-- lm: 0x12 27 -->
<UL> This can be the only instance (pipe is

<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>Subsequent attempts to make a pipe fails if the
maximum number of allowed instances already exists.  The ICount parameter
is ignored when making any other than the first instance of a pipe.  When
multiple instances are allowed, multiple clients can simultaneously issue

<P>
A named pipe provides two-way communication between a server process and
a number of client processes. In addition, the named pipe can have multiple
instances created by multiple server processes.
<P>
The server creates the pipe with DosMakeNmPipe.  The ICount parameter is
significant only for the first instance created of the named pipe. The ASCIIZ
name string specified for the named pipe must include the prefix \PIPE\.

<P>
After creating the named pipe, the server issues <A HREF="015_L2_DosConnectNmPipe.html">DosConnectNmPipe
</A>to wait for a client to open the pipe with <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.
If all instances of a named pipe are busy, a client process can issue <A HREF="172_L2_DosWaitNmPipe.html">DosWaitNmPipe
</A>and wait for an instance to become available before it reissues <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.
A client can determine whether the pipe is ready to accept a <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen
</A>by issuing <A HREF="095_L2_DosPeekNmPipe.html">DosPeekNmPipe</A> to
return the pipe's state.
<P>
Server and client processes communicate by issuing <A HREF="124_L2_DosRead.html">DosRead</A>,
 <A HREF="125_L2_DosReadAsync.html">DosReadAsync</A>, <A HREF="173_L2_DosWrite.html">DosWrite</A>,
and <A HREF="174_L2_DosWriteAsync.html">DosWriteAsync</A> calls.  <A HREF="005_L2_DosBufReset.html">DosBufReset
</A>can be used to to synchronize read and write dialogs. A server process
that need to support a large number of clients for a local named pipe can
coordinate access to the pipe with <A HREF="149_L2_DosSetNmPipeSem.html">DosSetNmPipeSem
</A>and <A HREF="118_L2_DosQNmPipeSemState.html">DosQNmPipeSemState</A> calls.

<P>
Server and client processes can also communicate by means of transaction
and procedure calls.  <A HREF="170_L2_DosTransactNmPipe.html">DosTransactNmPipe
</A>and <A HREF="007_L2_DosCallNmPipe.html">DosCallNmPipe</A> are supported
only for duplex message pipes.
<P>
Issuing <A HREF="012_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose</A> ends the client's access
to the named pipe. To prepare the pipe for its next client, the server process
issues <A HREF="026_L2_DosDisConnectNmPipe.html">DosDisConnectNmPipe</A> followed
by <A HREF="015_L2_DosConnectNmPipe.html">DosConnectNmPipe</A>.
<P>
When all handles to one end of the pipe are closed, the pipe is considered
broken.  If the pipe is broken and the server issues <A HREF="012_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose</A>,
the pipe is immediately deallocated.
