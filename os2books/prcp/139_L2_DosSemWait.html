<P>
This call blocks the current thread until an indicated semaphore clears,
but does not establish ownership of the semaphore.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Reference to the
semaphore.
<P>
For a system semaphore, this reference is the handle returned by a <A HREF="019_L2_DosCreateSem.html">DosCreateSem
</A>or <A HREF="094_L2_DosOpenSem.html">DosOpenSem</A> request that granted
the requesting thread access to the semaphore.
<P>
For a RAM semaphore, this reference is the address of a doubleword of storage,
allocated and initialized to zero by the application. This sets the semaphore
as unowned. Other than initializing the doubleword to zero, an application
must not modify a RAM semaphore directly; instead it manipulates the semaphore
with semaphore function calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The unblocking of a thread blocked by a DosSemWait is level-triggered. That
is, DosSemWait does not return until the semaphore remains clear long enough
for the affected thread to be redispatched and determine that the semaphore
is clear.
<P>
When an application needs to guarantee that another event has occurred before
continuing, it calls <A HREF="138_L2_DosSemSetWait.html">DosSemSetWait</A>.
<A HREF="138_L2_DosSemSetWait.html">DosSemSetWait</A> combines the functions
of <A HREF="137_L2_DosSemSet.html">DosSemSet</A> and  DosSemWait and is
used when there is a chance the semaphore may be cleared by a thread that
gets an intervening time slice between calls by the current thread to set
the semaphore and wait until it is cleared. Issuing DosSemWait on a semaphore
that has been cleared has no effect; the thread continues to execute.
