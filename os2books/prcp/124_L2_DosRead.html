<P>
The requested number of bytes may not be read.  If the value returned in
BytesRead is zero, the process has tried to read from the end of the file.

<P>
A BufferLength value of zero is not considered an error.  In the case where
BufferLength is zero, the system treats the request as a null operation.

<P>
The file pointer is moved to the desired position by reading, writing, or
issuing <A HREF="010_L2_DosChgFilePtr.html">DosChgFilePtr</A>.
<P>

<BR>
<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode.
 Therefore, the following restrictions apply to DosRead when coding for
the DOS mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Only single-byte DosRead calls may be made to the
COM device, because the COM device driver for the DOS environment does not
support multiple-byte I/O.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>When
DosRead is called with a handle that is open to CON, the read goes directly
through KbdStringIn using the buffer and length that are provided to DosRead.
 This causes a DOS mode DosRead to behave differently than an OS/2 mode
DosRead. Because an OS/2 mode DosRead buffers the call to KbdStringIn, this
allows the user to enter many more characters.
<P>
For example, suppose DosRead is called with a buffer of length 10 from a
handle opened to CON:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In OS/2 mode, the user is allowed to enter a large
number of characters before KbdStringIn begins beeping (indicating the buffer
is full). After carriage return is pressed, KbdStringIn returns to DosRead.
DosRead returns the first 10 characters to the caller and the remaining
characters on subsequent calls to DosRead from CON.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In DOS mode, the user is allowed to enter only eight
characters (DOS mode DosRead reserves two characters for CR and LF) before
KbdStringIn begins beeping. DosRead returns the eight characters entered,
followed by CR and LF to the calling program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
A named pipe is read as one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A byte pipe in byte read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A message pipe in message read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A message pipe in byte read mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A byte pipe must be in byte read mode to be read; an error is returned if
it is in message read mode. All currently available data, up to the size
requested, is returned.
<P>
A message pipe can be read in either message read mode or byte read mode.
When the message pipe is in message read mode, a read that is larger than
the next available message returns only that message.  BytesRead is set
to indicate the size of the message returned.
<P>
A read that is smaller than the next available message returns with the
number of bytes requested and an ERROR_MORE_DATA return code. When resuming
the reading of a message after ERROR_MORE_DATA is returned, a read always
blocks until the next piece (or the rest) of the message can be transferred.
<A HREF="095_L2_DosPeekNmPipe.html">DosPeekNmPipe</A> may be used to determine
how many bytes are left in the message.
<P>
A message pipe in byte read mode is read as if it were a byte stream, skipping
over message headers.  This is like reading a byte pipe in byte read mode.

<P>
When blocking mode is set for a named pipe, a read blocks until data is
available.  In this case, the read never returns with BytesRead =<!-- entering slot 154 -->
0 except at EOF.  In message read mode, messages are always read in their
entirety, except in the case where the message is bigger than the size of
the read.
<P>
Non-blocking mode allows a return with BytesRead = 0 only when no data is
available at the time of the read.
