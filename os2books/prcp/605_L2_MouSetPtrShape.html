<UL> Address of a buffer
containing the bit image used by the mouse device driver as the pointer

<UL> Number of columns in the mouse shape.
In graphics modes, this field contains the pel width (columns) of the mouse

col must equal 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> This value is returned by the mouse
device driver to indicate the relative column offset within the pointer
image.  The value defines the center (hotspot) of the pointer image. This
value is a signed number that represents either character or pel offset,
depending on the display mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL>This value is returned by the mouse device driver
to indicate the relative row offset within the pointer image.  The value
defines the center (hotspot) of the pointer image. This value is a signed
number that represents either character or pel offset, depending on the
display mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Programming Note:</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> For
other custom displays and for the extended modes of the EGA attachment,
it is possible to set the display to modes that require multiple bit planes.
 In these cases, the area sized by the row and column limits must be repeated
for each bit plane supported in that mode.  Consequently, the calling process
must supply enough data to allow the mouse device driver to draw the pointer
shape on all currently supported bit planes in that session. For text modes,
row and column offset must equal 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
An application passes a data image to the mouse device driver that the mouse
driver applies to the screen whenever the logical pointer position is not
located in the application-defined collision<!-- entering slot 653 -->  area.
 The application synchronizes use of the screen with the mouse driver by
way of <A HREF="601_L2_MouRemovePtr.html">MouRemovePtr</A> and <A HREF="587_L2_MouDrawPtr.html">MouDrawPtr</A>.

<P>
The pointer shape is dependent on the display device driver used to support
the display device.  OS/2 supports text and graphics modes. These modes
are restricted to modes 0 through 7, depending on the display device.  Character
modes (modes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7) support the pointer cursor only as a reverse
block character.  This reverse block character has a character height and
width equal to 1.
<P>
The pointer shape is mapped by the Pointer Draw Device Driver and determined
completely by the application.  The height and width may vary from 1 through
the pel size of the display screen.  For restrictions concerning the Pointer
Draw Device Driver, see IBM Operating System/2 Version 1.2 I/O Subsystems
And Device Support Volume 1.
