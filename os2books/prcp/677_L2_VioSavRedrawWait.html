<P>
OS/2 uses VioSavRedrawWait to notify a graphics mode application to save
or restore its screen image at screen switch time.  The application in the
outgoing foreground session is notified to perform a save.  The application
in the incoming foreground session is notified to perform a restore.  The
application must perform the action requested and immediately re-issue VioSavRedrawWait.
 When an application performs a save, it saves its physical display buffer,
video mode, and any other information the application needs to completely
redraw its screen at restore time.
<P>
Only one process per session can issue VioSavRedrawWait.  The process that
first issues VioSavRedrawWait becomes the owner of the function.
<P>
A text mode application must issue VioSavRedrawWait only if the application
writes directly to the registers on the display adapter. Assuming VioSavRedrawWait
is not issued by a text mode application, OS/2 performs the required saves
and restores.
<P>
An application that issues VioSavRedrawWait may also need to issue <A HREF="669_L2_VioModeWait.html">VioModeWait</A>.
 This would allow the application to be notified when it must restore its
mode at the completion of an application or hard error pop-up.  Refer to
<A HREF="669_L2_VioModeWait.html">VioModeWait</A> for more information.
 Two application threads would be required to perform these operations in
this case.
<P>
At the time a VioSavRedrawWait thread is notified, the session is in transition
to/from the background.  Although the session's official status is background,
any selector to the physical display buffer previously obtained by the VioSavRedrawWait
process (through <A HREF="665_L2_VioGetPhysBuf.html">VioGetPhysBuf</A>)
is valid at this time.  The physical display buffer must be accessed without
issuing <A HREF="678_L2_VioScrLock.html">VioScrLock</A>.  Since the session's
official status is background, any thread waits if it issues <A HREF="678_L2_VioScrLock.html">VioScrLock
</A>with the "wait if unsuccessful" option.
<P>
An application containing a VioSavRedrawWait thread should be designed so
that the process does not cause any hard errors while the VioSavRedrawWait
thread is running, otherwise a system lockout may occur.
<P>
An application's VioSavRedrawWait thread may be notified to perform a restore
before it is notified to perform a save.  This happens if the application
was running in the background the first time it issued VioSavRedrawWait.
 The return from this function call provides the notification.  The thread
that issues the call performs the save or redraw and then reissues VioSavRedrawWait
to wait until its screen image must be saved or redrawn again.
