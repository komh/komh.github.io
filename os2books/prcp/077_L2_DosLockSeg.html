<P>
Discardable segments are useful for holding objects that are accessed for
short periods of time and that can be regenerated quickly if discarded.
 Examples are cache buffers for a data base package, saved bitmap images
for obscured windows or precomputed display images for a word processing
application.
<P>
Discardable memory is allocated by a call to <A HREF="002_L2_DosAllocSeg.html">DosAllocSeg
</A>or  <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge</A> with AllocFlags
bit 2 set.  Upon allocation, the memory is automatically locked for access
by the allocating process and cannot be discarded. After the segment is
unlocked by a <A HREF="171_L2_DosUnlockSeg.html">DosUnlockSeg</A> request,
the memory can be discarded by the memory manager to remedy a low memory
situation.  Once memory is discarded, a DosLockSeg call returns ERROR_DISCARDED.
 The memory is reallocated by a call to <A HREF="128_L2_DosReallocSeg.html">DosReallocSeg
</A>or <A HREF="127_L2_DosReallocHuge.html">DosReallocHuge</A>.  The reallocation
request automatically locks the memory.
<P>
Memory allocated as discardable by a <A HREF="002_L2_DosAllocSeg.html">DosAllocSeg
</A>or  <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge</A> request may
also have been designated as shareable. Sharing processes that access the
discardable shared memory with <A HREF="069_L2_DosGetSeg.html">DosGetSeg
</A>have to lock the memory by calling DosLockSeg. See <A HREF="069_L2_DosGetSeg.html">DosGetSeg
</A>for more information.
<P>
DosLockSeg and <A HREF="171_L2_DosUnlockSeg.html">DosUnlockSeg</A> calls
may be nested.  If  DosLockSeg is called multiple times to lock a segment,
the same number of calls must be made to <A HREF="171_L2_DosUnlockSeg.html">DosUnlockSeg
</A>before the segment is unlocked.  However, if a segment is locked 255
times, it becomes permanently locked. Additional calls to DosLockSeg and
<A HREF="171_L2_DosUnlockSeg.html">DosUnlockSeg</A> have no effect on the
segment's locked state.
<P>
This function is used on segments that have been allocated through <A HREF="002_L2_DosAllocSeg.html">DosAllocSeg
</A>with AllocFlags bit 2 (0100B) set. It may be also used on segments that
are non-discardable, in which case it has no effect.
