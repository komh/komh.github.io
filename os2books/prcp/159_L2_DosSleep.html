This call suspends the current thread for a specified time.  If the requested
interval is 0, the call gives up the remainder of the current time slice.

<P>
DosSleep suspends the current thread for the specified time period.  The
actual time it is asleep may be off by a clock tick or two, depending on
the execution status of other threads running in the system.
<P>
If the time is 0, the thread gives up the remainder of the current time
slice and allows any other ready threads of equal priority to run with the
current thread for its next slice. Because the amount of sleep time specified
is 0, an immediate return with 0 delay is made if no other ready thread
is found. However, DosSleep does not yield to a thread of lower priority.

<P>
If the time is non-0, the time is rounded up to the resolution of the scheduler
clock.
<P>
If DosSleep is used to regularly poll an external source to determine the
occurrence of some event, a time equal to the longest response interval
should be used.
<P>
For short time intervals, the rounding-up process combined with the thread
priority interactions may cause a sleeping interval to be longer than requested.
 Also, when a process completes sleeping, it is scheduled for execution.
 But that execution could be delayed by hardware interrupts or by another
thread running at a higher priority.  A program should not use the DosSleep
call as a substitute for a real-time clock because rounding of the sleep
interval causes cumulative errors.
<P>
Asynchronous timers can be started with <A HREF="167_L2_DosTimerAsync.html">DosTimerAsync
</A>and  <A HREF="168_L2_DosTimerStart.html">DosTimerStart</A>. <A HREF="167_L2_DosTimerAsync.html">DosTimerAsync
</A>starts a one-shot asynchronous timer, and <A HREF="168_L2_DosTimerStart.html">DosTimerStart
</A>starts a periodic interval timer.  <A HREF="169_L2_DosTimerStop.html">DosTimerStop
</A>is issued to stop these timers.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To ensure optimum performance, you should not use DosSleep
in a single-thread Presentation Manager application. See WinStartTimer.

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore,
the following restrictions apply to DosSleep when coding in DOS mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>DosSleep accuracy can be in error by 0.5%.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>DosSleep can degrade system performance of
non-foreground program operations when DOS mode is in foreground.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
