<UL> Write-Through
flag:
<P>
0 = Writes to the file may be run through the system buffer cache.
<P>
1 = Writes to the file may go through the system buffer cache, but the data
is written (actual file I/O completed) before a synchronous write call returns.
This state of the file defines it as a synchronous file. For synchronous
files, this is a mandatory bit in that the data must be written out to the
medium for synchronous write operations.

This bit is not inherited by child processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>Fail-Errors flag.  Media I/O errors are handled
as follows:
<P>
0 = Reported through the system critical error handler.
<P>
1 = Reported directly to the caller by way of a return code.
<P>
Media I/O errors generated through an IOCTL category 8 function always get
reported directly to the caller by way of a return code.  The Fail-Errors
function applies only to non-IOCTL handle-based type file I/O calls.

This bit is not inherited by child processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>No-Cache/Cache flag.  The file is opened as follows:

<P>
0 = It is advisable for the disk driver to cache the data in I/O operations
on this file.
<P>
1 = I/O to the file need not be done through the disk driver cache.
<P>
This bit is an advisory bit, and is used to advise FSDs and device drivers
on whether it is worth caching the data or not. This bit, like the write-through
bit, is a per-handle bit.

<P>
OS/2 does not guarantee the order that sectors are written for multiple
sector writes.  If an application requires several sectors written in a
specific order, the operator should issue them as separate synchronous write
operations. Setting the write-through flag does not affect any previous
writes.  That data may remain in the buffers. When a critical error occurs
that the application cannot handle, it may reset critical error handling
to be performed by the system. This is done by calling DosSetFHandState
to turn off the fail/errors bit and reissuing the I/O call. The expected
critical error reoccurs and control is passed to the system critical error
handler. The precise time that the effect of this function is visible at
the application level is unpredictable when asynchronous I/O is pending.

<P>
The file handle state bits set by this function can be queried by <A HREF="110_L2_DosQFHandState.html">DosQFHandState</A>.

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate<!-- entering slot 175 -->  differently in the DOS mode
than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore, the following restrictions apply to DosSetFHandState
when coding for the DOS mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The validity of the file handle is not checked.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The Inheritance flag must be set equal to zero.
(This flag is not supported in DOS 2.X.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The Write-Through flag must be set equal to
zero.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The Fail-Errors flag must be set equal to zero.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosSetFHandState allows setting of the inheritance (I) and Write-Through
(W) bits.  Setting W to 1 prevents write-behind operations on remote pipes.
