</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
To set any level of file information for a file or subdirectory with DosSetPathInfo,
a process must have exclusive write access to the closed file object. Thus,
if the file object is already accessed by another process, a call to DosSetPathInfo
fails.
<P>
A zero (0) value in both the date and time components of a field cause that
field to be left unchanged.  For example, if both "Last write date" and
"Last write time" are specified as zero in the Level 0001H information structure,
then both attributes of the file are left unchanged. If either "Last write
date" or "Last write time" are specified as non-zero, then both attributes
of the file are set to the new values.
<P>
The write-through bit in PathInfo Flags should be used only in cases where
it is necessary, for data integrity purposes, to write the EAs out to disk
immediately, instead of caching them and writing them out later. Setting
the write-through bit all the time may degrade the performance.
<P>
The last modification date and time will get changed if the extended attributes
are modified.
