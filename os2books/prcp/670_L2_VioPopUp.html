and if the video mode of the outgoing foreground session is not text (or
if the outgoing foreground session has a <A HREF="677_L2_VioSavRedrawWait.html">VioSavRedrawWait

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
VioPopUp is normally issued by the application when it is running in the
background and wishes to immediately display a message to the user without
waiting to become the active foreground session.
<P>
When an application process issues VioPopUp, it should wait for the return
from the request.  If the process allows any of its threads to write to
the screen before VioPopUp returns a successful return code, the screen
output may be directed to the application's normal video buffer rather than
to the pop-up screen. If the process allows any of its threads to issue
keyboard or mouse calls before VioPopUp returns a successful return code,
the input is directed from the application's normal session. Once the process
that issued VioPopUp receives a successful return code, video and keyboard
calls issued by any of the threads in the pop-up process are directed to
the pop-up screen.  This continues until the process issues <A HREF="656_L2_VioEndPopUp.html">VioEndPopUp</A>.
At that time video and keyboard calls resume being directed to the application's
normal video buffer.
<P>
There may be only one pop-up in existence at any time.  If a process requests
a pop-up and a pop-up already exists, the process has the choice of waiting
for the prior pop-up to complete or receiving an immediate return with an
error code.  The error code indicates that the operation failed due to an
existing pop-up having captured the screen.
<P>
Video pop-ups provide a mechanism for a background application to notify
the operator of an abnormal event the operator must take some action.  When
considering the suitability of using pop-ups in a particular situation,
the possible disruptive effect of pop-ups to the operator should be considered.
 If the operator were interrupted frequently by pop-ups issued by background
applications, the operator would not effectively work with the foreground
application.
<P>
While a video pop-up is in the foreground, the operator cannot use the hot
key to switch to another application or to the shell<!-- entering slot 722 --> .
 Before the operator can switch another application or the shell to the
foreground, the pop-up application must issue <A HREF="656_L2_VioEndPopUp.html">VioEndPopUp</A>.

<P>
While a video pop-up is in effect, all video calls from the previous foreground
session are blocked until the process that issued VioPopUp issues <A HREF="656_L2_VioEndPopUp.html">VioEndPopUp</A>.

<P>
When VioPopUp is issued, only the process within the session that issued
VioPopUp is brought to the foreground.  Assuming the session was already
the foreground session, any video calls issued by other processes in that
session are blocked until the process that issued VioPopUp issues <A HREF="656_L2_VioEndPopUp.html">VioEndPopUp</A>.

<P>
DosExecPgm may not be issued by a process during a pop-up. The following
video calls are the only calls that may be issued during the pop-up by the
process that issued VioPopUp:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Selectors to the physical display buffer that the issuing process obtained
on a prior <A HREF="665_L2_VioGetPhysBuf.html">VioGetPhysBuf</A> call may
not be used during the pop-up.
<P>
When an application registers a replacement for VioPopUp within a session,
the registered routine is invoked only when that session is in the foreground.
 If VioPopUp is issued when that session is in the background, the OS/2
default routine is invoked. If the application's session is using a keyboard
or mouse monitor, the monitor does not intercept data while the pop-up is
active.
<P>
<B>PM Considerations</B>
<P>
This function can be used from within a PM application.  Kbdxxx, Mouxxx,
and Vioxxx calls (with a zero handle) are all allowed between VioPopUp and
<A HREF="656_L2_VioEndPopUp.html">VioEndPopUp</A>, and are directed to the
pop-up screen.  An error is returned if issued with a non-zero handle.
