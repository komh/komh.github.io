<P>
The requested number of bytes may not be read. If the value in BytesRead
is zero, the process tried to read from the end of the file.
<P>
A BufferLength value of zero is not considered an error.  In the case where
BufferLength is zero, the system treats the request as a null operation.

<P>
The file pointer is moved to the desired position by reading, writing, or
issuing <A HREF="010_L2_DosChgFilePtr.html">DosChgFilePtr</A>.
<P>
A call to DosReadAsync may return before the read is complete. To wait for
an asynchronous read to complete, RamSemaphore must be set by the application
before the DosReadAsync call is made. The application issues <A HREF="137_L2_DosSemSet.html">DosSemSet
</A>to set the semaphore, calls  DosReadAsync, and then issues <A HREF="139_L2_DosSemWait.html">DosSemWait</A>,
to wait to be signaled by the system that the asynchronous read is complete.
When RamSemaphore is cleared and the read operation is complete, ReturnCode
can be checked.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If it is necessary to make a DosReadAsync request from within
a segment that has I/O privilege, <A HREF="006_L2_DosCallback.html">DosCallback
</A>may be used to invoke a privilege level 3 segment that actually issues
the DosReadAsync request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<BR>
<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
A named pipe is read as one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A byte pipe in byte read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A message pipe in message read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A message pipe in byte read mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A byte pipe must be in byte read mode to be read; an error is returned if
it is in message read mode. All currently available data, up to the size
requested, is returned.
<P>
When a message pipe is read in message read mode, a read that is larger
than the next available message returns only that message and BytesRead
is set to indicate the size of the message returned.
<P>
A read that is smaller than the next available message returns with the
number of bytes requested and an ERROR_MORE_DATA return code. When resuming
the reading of a message after ERROR_MORE_DATA is returned, a read always
blocks until the next piece (or rest) of the message can be transferred.
<A HREF="095_L2_DosPeekNmPipe.html">DosPeekNmPipe</A> may be used to determine
how many bytes are left in the message.
<P>
A message pipe in byte read mode is read as if it were a byte stream, skipping
over message headers.  This is like reading a byte pipe in byte read mode.

<P>
When blocking mode is set for a named pipe, a read blocks until data is
available.  In this case, the read never returns with BytesRead = 0 except
at EOF.  In message read mode, messages are always read in their entirety,
except in the case where the message is bigger than the size of the read.

<P>
Non-blocking mode allows a return with BytesRead = 0 only when trying to
read at the start of a message and no message is available.
