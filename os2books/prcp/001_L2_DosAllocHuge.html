<P>
<A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge</A> allows a process to
allocate a large amount of memory by telling the system how many 64KB segments
it needs and whether it requires an additional partial segment.  The system
allocates the memory, which is movable and swappable, and returns a selector
to the first segment. When this selector is used with a call, the requested
function is performed for the entire block of memory.
<P>
Each segment of a huge memory allocation has a unique selector. To determine
the remaining selectors of a huge memory allocation, issue <A HREF="057_L2_DosGetHugeShift.html">DosGetHugeShift</A>,
which returns a shift count. To compute the next sequential selector, take
the value 1 and shift it left by the number of bits specified in shift count.
Use the resulting value as an increment to add to the previous selector,
using the selector returned by <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge
</A>as the first selector. For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Assume <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge
</A>is issued with NumSeg equal to 3, and that the number 63 is returned
for the selector of the first segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>If <A HREF="057_L2_DosGetHugeShift.html">DosGetHugeShift
</A>returns a shift count of 4, shifting the value "1" by this amount results
in an increment of 16.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Adding this increment to selector number 63
produces 79 for the second selector. Adding the same increment to selector
number 79 yields 95 for the third selector.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Like single segment memory allocated with <A HREF="002_L2_DosAllocSeg.html">DosAllocSeg</A>,
huge memory can be designated as shareable by other processes and discardable
by the system when no longer needed.  Allocating a huge block of memory
as discardable automatically locks the memory for use by the caller. When
one segment of a huge allocation is discarded by the system, this forces
the discard of all the other segments. See <A HREF="002_L2_DosAllocSeg.html">DosAllocSeg
</A>for more information relating to discardable and shared segments.
<P>
Applications should be discretionary in claiming large memory when doing
so can impair system performance.  To test system memory availability, issue
<A HREF="080_L2_DosMemAvail.html">DosMemAvail</A>.  This call returns the
size of the largest block of unallocated memory. Although this value can
change at any time because of system activity<!-- entering slot 2 --> ,
it can provide a good indication of the system memory state.
<P>
Memory allocated by <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge</A> is
freed by <A HREF="046_L2_DosFreeSeg.html">DosFreeSeg</A>.  One call to <A HREF="046_L2_DosFreeSeg.html">DosFreeSeg</A>,
passing the selector returned from a  <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge</A>,
frees all of the memory allocated.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This request may be issued from privilege level 2.  However,
the segment is allocated as a privilege level 3 segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode.
 Therefore, the following considerations apply to <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge
</A>when coding for the DOS mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Requested size value is rounded up to the next paragraph
(16-byte)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Selector is the actual segment address allocated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
