<P>
DosAllocSeg allows a process to allocate a data segment up to 64KB in size,
which is movable and swappable by the system. If your application needs
to accommodate a large data structure that exceeds the 64KB limit, <A HREF="001_L2_DosAllocHuge.html">DosAllocHuge
</A>may be issued to allocate multiple segments as one huge block of memory.

<P>
A segment allocated by DosAllocSeg with AllocFlags bit 2 set can be discarded
by the system to remedy a low memory situation when the segment is not in
use. Upon allocation, a discardable segment is locked and ready for access.
The caller issues DosUnlockSeg when it is finished using the segment. The
next time the caller needs to access the segment, it must issue DosLockSeg.
During the time a segment is locked, it cannot be discarded, but it can
still be swapped.
<P>
Allocate memory as discardable when it is needed to hold data for only short
periods of time; for example, saved bit map images for obscured windows.
Once the system discards a segment, the caller must reallocate the segment
with DosReallocSeg and regenerate the data. Reallocating the segment automatically
locks it for the first access. 
<P>
A segment may also be designated as shared with another process. If a process
issues DosAllocSeg with AllocFlags bit 0 set, then the segment allocated
is shareable through <A HREF="072_L2_DosGiveSeg.html">DosGiveSeg</A>. To
share the segment in this manner, the owning process can then issue DosGiveSeg
to obtain a selector for the sharer to use. The owning process then passes
the selector to the sharer using some means of interprocess communication.
The sharing process can use the selector to access the shared segment. If
the shared segment has been designated discardable (AllocFlags bit 2 is
also set), the sharer must issue <A HREF="077_L2_DosLockSeg.html">DosLockSeg
</A>to lock the segment.
<P>
Memory allocated with DosAllocSeg is freed by a call to <A HREF="046_L2_DosFreeSeg.html">DosFreeSeg</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This request may be issued from privilege level 2.  However,
the segment is allocated as a privilege level 3 segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<BR>
<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode.
 Therefore, the following restrictions apply to DosAllocSeg when coding
for the DOS mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Requested Size value is rounded up to the next paragraph
(16-byte).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Selector is the actual segment address allocated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>AllocFlags must be set to zero.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
