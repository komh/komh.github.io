<UL> Address of a drive
letter or the name of a character or pseudo-character device. If DeviceName
is a drive, it is an ASCIIZ string having the form of drive letter followed
by a colon. If DeviceName is a character or pseudo-character device name,
its format is that of an ASCIIZ string in the format of an OS/2 file name
in a subdirectory called \DEV\. This parameter is ignored if level 2 or
3 is specified for FSAInfoLevel.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Index into the list of character or pseudo-character
devices, or the set of drives.  Ordinal always starts at 1.  The Ordinal
position of an item in a list has no significance at all.  Ordinal is used
strictly to step through the list.  The mapping from Ordinal to item is
volatile and may change from one call to DosQFSAttach to the next. This
parameter is ignored if level 1 is specified for FSAInfoLevel.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> For
local drives (iType = 3), szFSDName contains the name of the FSD attached
to the drive at the time of the call.  This information changes dynamically.
 If the drive is attached to the kernel's resident file system, szFSDName
contains FAT or unknown. Since the resident file system gets attached to
any disk that other FSDs refuse to mount, it is possible to have a disk
that does not contain a recognizable file system, but yet gets attached
to the resident file system.  In this case, it is possible to detect the
difference, and this information would help programs in not destroying data
on a disk that was not properly recognized.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Information about all block devices and all character and pseudo-character
devices is returned by this call.
<P>
The information returned by this call is highly volatile.  Calling programs
should be aware that the returned information may have already changed by
the time it's returned to them.
<P>
The information returned for disks that are attached to the kernel's resident
file system can be used to determine if the kernel definitely recognized
the disk as one with its file system on it, or if the kernel just attached
its file  system to it because no other FSDs mounted the disk. This can
be important information for a program that needs to know what<!-- entering slot 141 -->
file system is attached to the drive.  It is quite easy to get into a situation
where the FSD that recognizes a certain disk has not been installed into
the system.  In such a case, there is a potential for the data on the disk
to be destroyed since the wrong file system is attached to the disk by default.
