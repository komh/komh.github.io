This call performs multiple locking, unlocking, seeking, and I/O operations

<UL> Address
of the list of entries, indicating the operations to be performed. CmdLock,
CmdUnlock, CmdSeek, and CmdIO operations are atomic. Thus, the completion
of one operation is not dependent upon the completion of another operation
following it in the list. Operations are performed until all are complete
or until one fails.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

Because the lock operation is atomic, if a lock within a CmdLock causes
a time out, none of the other locks within the scope of CmdLock are in force.

<P>
DosFileIO combines the following operations into a single request:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Unlocking and locking multiple file ranges<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Changing the file position pointer<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Performing file I/O.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The ability to combine operations on files provides improved performance
and makes DosFileIO particularly suited to a networking environment.
<P>
Unlike <A HREF="038_L2_DosFileLocks.html">DosFileLocks</A>, which unconditionally
prevents access to only one range in a file at a time, DosFileIO permits
multiple regions to be locked. DosFileIO also offers the option of read-only
access to locked regions by the current process and any sharing processes.

<P>
If another process attempts to read or write in a "No-access" region, or
if any process attempts to write in a "Read-only" region, ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
is returned.
<P>
A range to be locked must first be cleared of any locked subranges or overlapping
ranges. If a time out occurs before locking can be completed, DosFileIO
returns with an unsuccessful return code. The caller may return after the
time-out period has expired without receiving an ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT.  Therefore,
semaphore time-out values should not be used for exact timing and sequencing.
