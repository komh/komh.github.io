This call unconditionally clears a semaphore.  If any threads were blocked
on the semaphore, they are restarted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Reference to the

<P>
For a system semaphore, this reference is the handle returned by a <A HREF="019_L2_DosCreateSem.html">DosCreateSem
</A>or <A HREF="094_L2_DosOpenSem.html">DosOpenSem</A> request that granted
the requesting thread access to the semaphore.
<P>
For a RAM semaphore, this reference is the address of a doubleword of storage,
allocated and initialized to zero by the application. This sets the semaphore
as unowned. Other than initializing the doubleword to zero, an application
must not modify a RAM semaphore directly; instead it manipulates the semaphore
with semaphore function calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
DosSemClear typically is used to release a semaphore obtained through <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest</A>.
DosSemClear also is used with the semaphore signaling functions <A HREF="138_L2_DosSemSetWait.html">DosSemSetWait</A>,
<A HREF="139_L2_DosSemWait.html">DosSemWait</A>, and  <A HREF="089_L2_DosMuxSemWait.html">DosMuxSemWait</A>.

<P>
If the semaphore is an exclusive system semaphore, it has a use count associated
with it, which is incremented by a <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest
</A>and decremented by a DosSemClear. The semaphore is not actually cleared
and made available to the next thread that wants to access the resource
until the semaphore has been cleared the same number of times it has been
requested. This means that exclusive system semaphores can be used in recursive
routines.  When the use count is 0, the semaphore is available to be claimed
by the next user of the protected resource.
<P>
Normally, DosSemClear cannot be issued against a system semaphore owned
by another process unless the NoExclusive option is set by the <A HREF="019_L2_DosCreateSem.html">DosCreateSem
</A>request that created the semaphore.  However, at interrupt time any
thread may clear an exclusively owned semaphore.
