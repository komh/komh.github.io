<P>
OS/2 creates the first thread of a process when it starts the executable
file.  This thread is dispatched with a regular class priority. To start
another thread of execution under the current process, the current thread
allocates stack memory and issues DosCreateThread. Upon generation of the
far call, the thread's initial dispatch point is the address specified for
PgmAddress. The started thread has a unique stack and register context and
the same priority as the requesting thread.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The minimum available space on the stack for a thread calling
an operating system function must be 4K bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
A thread's stack, register context, and priority is the only information
maintained by OS/2 that is specific to the thread. The thread shares resources
with other threads of the process. Any thread in the process can open a
file or device, and any other thread can issue a read or write to that handle.
This is also true for pipes, queues, and system semaphores.
<P>
The address passed as the NewThreadStack value must be the address of the
highest byte in the stack. This value is loaded into the SS:PP registers
before starting the new thread.
<P>
A thread started with DosCreateThread terminates upon return of this call
or when a <A HREF="034_L2_DosExit.html">DosExit</A> is issued. Any thread
can temporarily stop the execution of other threads in its process with
<A HREF="166_L2_DosSuspendThread.html">DosSuspendThread</A>, <A HREF="129_L2_DosResumeThread.html">DosResumeThread</A>,
 <A HREF="029_L2_DosEnterCritSec.html">DosEnterCritSec</A>, and <A HREF="035_L2_DosExitCritSec.html">DosExitCritSec
</A>calls.  Any thread can also examine and change the priority at which
it and other threads execute with <A HREF="066_L2_DosGetPrty.html">DosGetPrty
</A>and  <A HREF="152_L2_DosSetPrty.html">DosSetPrty</A>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> DosCreateThread cannot be issued from within a segment that
has I/O privilege (IOPL).  If the new thread entry point is in an IOPL code
segment, a general protection fault is generated, and the process is terminated.

<P>
All code segments execute at a privilege level. Segments for OS/2 applications
usually execute at privilege level 3. However, if an application has an
IOPL code segment that is executing at privilege level 2 and has to start
another thread of execution, <A HREF="006_L2_DosCallback.html">DosCallback
</A>can be issued from the IOPL segment to invoke a privilege level 3 segment.
 But before the DosCreateThread request is made, the IOPL segment's stack
must be resized in the privilege level 3 segment by a call to <A HREF="123_L2_DosR2StackRealloc.html">DosR2StackRealloc</A>.
For more information on IOPL code segments, see IBM Operating System/2 Version
1.2 I/O Subsystems And Device Support Volume 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
