<P>
On output, BytesWritten is the number of bytes actually written.  If BytesWritten
is different from BufferLength, this usually indicates insufficient disk
space.
<P>
A BufferLength value of 0 is not considered an error.  No data transfer
occurs.  There is no effect on the file or the file pointer.
<P>
Buffers that are multiples of the hardware's base physical unit for data
written to the file on these base boundaries, are written directly to the
device.  (The base physical unit is defined as the smallest block that can
be physically written to the device.)  Other buffer sizes force some I/O
to go through an internal system buffer and greatly reduce the efficiency
of I/O operation.
<P>
The file pointer is moved by read and write operations. It can be moved
to a desired position by calling <A HREF="010_L2_DosChgFilePtr.html">DosChgFilePtr</A>.

<P>
If the file is read-only, the write to the file is not performed.
<P>

<BR>
<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore,
the following restriction applies to DosWrite when coding for the DOS mode.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Only single-byte DosWrite requests can be made to
the COM device, because the COM device driver for the DOS environment does
not support multiple-byte I/O.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosWrite is also used to write bytes or messages to a named pipe.
<P>
Each write to a message pipe writes a message whose size is the length of
the write; DosWrite automatically encodes message lengths in the pipe, so
applications need not encode this information in the buffer being written.

<P>
Writes in blocking mode always write all requested bytes before returning.
In non-blocking mode, if the message size is bigger than the buffer size,
the write blocks. If the message size is smaller than the pipe but not enough
space is left in the pipe, the write returns immediately with a value of
zero, indicating no bytes were written.
<P>
In the case of a byte pipe, if the number of bytes to be written exceeds
the space available in the pipe, DosWrite writes as many bytes as it can
and returns with the number of bytes actually written.
<P>
An attempt to write to a pipe whose other end has been closed returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.
