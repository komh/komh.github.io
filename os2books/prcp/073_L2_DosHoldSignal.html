<P>
DosHoldSignal with ActionCode = 1 causes signal processing (except central
processing errors and numeric processor errors) to be postponed until a
DosHoldSignal with ActionCode = 0 is issued.  Any signals that occur while
processing is disabled are recognized, but not accepted until signal recognition
is enabled.
<P>
To allow for nesting of requests, a count of the number of outstanding DosHoldSignal
requests with ActionCode = 1 are maintained.
<P>
DosHoldSignal is used by library routines, subsystems, and similar code
that lock critical sections or temporarily reserve resources needed to prevent
a signal from terminating a task. A process can have only one signal handling
address for each signal. Dynalink routines should not have a signal handler
(which might override a handler established by a calling process).
<P>
Signals can be held for a short period and should be released and re-held,
if necessary.  Their guidelines for proper use are similar to hardware interrupt
counterparts such as the CLI/STI instructions.
<P>

<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode.
 Therefore, the following restriction applies to DosHoldSignal when coding
for the DOS mode:
<P>
The only signal recognized in the DOS mode is SIGINTR (Ctrl-C) and SIGBREAK.
Only SIGINTR and SIGBREAK are turned off by this call.
