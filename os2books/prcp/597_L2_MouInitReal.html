If the selector portion of the far address is zero and the offset portion
is non-zero, the offset portion identifies the power-up display configuration.

<P>
MouInitReal is issued by the Base Video Subsystem at system initialization
time.
<P>
The DOS mode mouse API (INT 33H), in contrast to the OS/2 mode Mouse API,
does not contain an OPEN command. In addition, there is only one session
for DOS mode.
<P>
The default pointer draw routine for DOS mode is located in the same pointer
draw device driver, POINTER$, that is used for OS/2 mode.  Establishing
addressability to the pointer draw routine must be done during system initialization.
 This requires passing the entry point of the DOS mode pointer draw routine
to the mouse device driver.  This is the purpose of the MouInitReal call.
 It passes the address of the default, power-up pointer draw routine for
DOS mode to the mouse device driver.  This initialization is transparent
to applications.
<P>
This call is for use only by the Base Video Subsystem when invoked during
system initialization under the shell/session manager PID.
<P>
The error code ERROR_MOUSE_SMG_ONLY is valid from shell process only.
