<P>
This call provides a general path search mechanism that allows applications
to find files residing along paths.  The path string may come from the process
environment, or be supplied directly by the caller.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DosSearchPath<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->

ResultBufferLen)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>Control</B> (USHORT) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> A word bit vector
that controls the behavior of DosSearchPath.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> Reserved
bits, must be zero.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 2<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Ignore
network errors bit. The Ignore Network Errors Bit controls whether the search
will abort if it encounters a network error or will continue the search
with the next element.  This allows one to place network paths in the PATH
variable and be able to find executables in components of the PATH variable
even if the network returns an error, for example, if a server is down.
 If the Ignore Network Errors Bit = 0, DosSearchPath will abort the search
if it encounters an error from the network.  If the Ignore Network Errors
Bit = 1, DosSearchPath will continue on the search if it encounters network
errors.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 1<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Path source bit.
 The path source bit determines how DosSearchPath interprets the PathRef
argument.
<P>
0 = The PathRef points to the actual search path. The search path string
may be anywhere in the calling process's address space.  Therefore, it may
be in the environment, but is not required.
<P>
1 = The PathRef points to the name of an environment variable in the process
environment, and that environment variable contains the search path.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 0
<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>Implied current bit. The implied current bit controls
whether the current directory is implicitly on the front of the search path.

<P>
0 = DosSearchPath only searches the current directory if it appears in the
search path.
<P>
1 = DosSearchPath searches the current working directory before it searches
the directories in the search path.
<P>
For example, implied current bit = 0 and path = ".\;a;b" is equivalent to
implied current bit = 1 and path = "a;b".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> PathRef
</B>(PSZ) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Address of the path. If the path
source bit of control = 0, PathRef is the search path that may be anywhere
in the caller's address space.
<P>
A search path consists of a sequence of paths separated by a semicolon (;).
 It is a single ASCIIZ string.  The directories are searched in the order
they appear in the path.
<P>
If the path source bit of control = 1, PathRef is the name of an environment
variable, that contains the search path.
<P>
A search path consists of a sequence of paths separated by ";". It is a
single ASCIIZ string.  The directories are searched in the order they appear
in the path.  Paths that contain ";"s should be quoted.  For example:
<PRE>"c:&amp;this  is  ;  one directory path";thisisanother</PRE>

<P>
Environment variable names are simply strings that match name strings in
the environment.  The equal (=) sign is not part of the name.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> FileName
</B>(PSZ) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Address of the ASCIIZ file name.
It may contain global file name characters.  If FileName does contain global
file name characters, they remain in the result path returned in ResultBuffer.
 This allows applications like CMD.EXE to feed the output directly to <A HREF="040_L2_DosFindFirst.html">DosFindFirst</A>.
 If there are no global file name characters in FileName, the resulting
path returned in ResultBuffer is a full qualified name, and may be passed
directly to <A HREF="091_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>, or any other system
call.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ResultBuffer</B> (PBYTE) - output<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Address
of the pathname of the file, if found. If FileName is found in one of the
directories along the path, its full pathname is returned in ResultBuffer
(with global file name characters from FileName left in place.) Do not depend
on the contents of ResultBuffer being meaningful if DosSearchPath returns
a non-zero return code.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ResultBufferLen</B> (USHORT)
- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Length, in bytes, of the ResultBuffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
PathRef always points to an ASCIIZ string. Let DPATH be an environment variable
in the environment segment of the process.
<PRE>"DPATH=c:\sysdir;c:\init"  /* in the environment */
</PRE>

<P>
The following two code fragments are equivalent:
<PRE>DosScanEnv("DPATH", &amp;PathRef);
DosSearchPath(0, /* Path Source Bit = 0 */
    PathRef, "myprog<!-- entering slot 163 -->.ini", &amp;ResultBuffer, ResultBufLen);

DosSearchPath(2, /* Path Source Bit = 1 */
    "DPATH", "myprog.ini", &amp;ResultBuffer, ResultBufLen);
</PRE>

<P>
They both use the search path stored as DPATH in the environment segment.
 In the first case, the application uses <A HREF="131_L2_DosScanEnv.html">DosScanEnv
</A>to find the variable: in the second case DosSearchPath calls <A HREF="131_L2_DosScanEnv.html">DosScanEnv
</A>for the application.
<P>
DosSearchPath does not check for consistency or formatting on the names.
 It does a <A HREF="040_L2_DosFindFirst.html">DosFindFirst</A> on a series
of names it constructs from PathRef and FileName.
<P>
To determine the size of the returned path name, the ResultBuffer must be
scanned for the ASCIIZ terminator.
<P>
<A HREF="120_L2_DosQSysInfo.html">DosQSysInfo</A> must be used by an application
to determine the maximum path length supported by OS/2.  The returned value
should be used to dynamically allocate buffers that are to be used to store
paths.
