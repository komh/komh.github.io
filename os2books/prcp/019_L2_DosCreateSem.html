</UL><B> SemName
</B>(PSZ) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Address of the name of the system
semaphore. A system semaphore is defined within the file system name space
as a pseudo file; thus, a semaphore has a full path name. The ASCIIZ string
specifying the name must include \SEM\ as the first element of the path.
For example, \SEM\RETRIEVE\SIGNAL.SEM is a valid semaphore name.
<P>
Although a system semaphore name takes the form of a file in a subdirectory
called \SEM, this subdirectory does not exist. System semaphores and their
names are kept in memory.
<P>
If your application provides long name support for an installable file system,
a semaphore name is not restricted to the DOS 8.3 filename format.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
A call to DosCreateSem creates a system semaphore, which can be manipulated
by threads issuing semaphore function calls. Manipulation of a system semaphore
is most often used to control access to a serially reusable resource. Manipulation
of the semaphore is also used to signal the occurrence of an event to waiting
threads.
<P>
To control access to a serially reusable resource, a process creates the
system semaphore with a call to DosCreateSem. If the users of the resource
are asynchronous threads of the creating process, NoExclusive=0 is specified
to create an exclusive system semaphore. If the users of the resource include
threads of other processes, NoExclusive=1 is specified to create a nonexclusive
system semaphore.
<P>
DosCreateSem returns a semaphore handle used by the creating process and
any of its threads to access the semaphore. If the semaphore is nonexclusive,
a process other than the semaphore creator calls <A HREF="094_L2_DosOpenSem.html">DosOpenSem
</A>for a handle to access the semaphore.
<P>
Ownership of the system semaphore is established by a successful <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest
</A>call. If another thread issues <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest
</A>while the semaphore is owned, the thread can block and wait for the
semaphore to become available, or it can return immediately.
<P>
After accessing the resource, the owning thread can clear the semaphore
by a call to <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear</A>. If the semaphore
is an exclusive system semaphore, it has a use count associated with it,
which is incremented by <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest
</A>calls and decremented by <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear
</A>calls. The semaphore is not actually cleared and made available to the
next thread waiting to use the resource until the semaphore has been cleared
the same number of times it has been requested. This means that exclusive
system semaphores can be used in recursive routines.
<P>
If a process has created a nonexclusive system semaphore and terminates
while the semaphore is open, the system closes the handle to the semaphore
that was returned by DosCreateSem. If the process is currently holding the
semaphore when it terminates, OS/2 clears the semaphore and returns ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED
to the next thread that gets the resource because of a <A HREF="136_L2_DosSemRequest.html">DosSemRequest
</A>call. This error message alerts the holder of the semaphore that the
semaphore owner may have ended abnormally; consequently, the resource is
in an indeterminate state.  The thread should take appropriates<!-- entering slot 21 -->
steps to protect the integrity of the resource.  Upon completion of cleanup
activity, the thread can release the semaphore by calling <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear</A>.
This call resets the error condition flagged in the semaphore data structure
and makes the semaphore available to the next user of the resource. The
semaphore remains available to all processes that obtained handles to it
with <A HREF="094_L2_DosOpenSem.html">DosOpenSem</A> requests until they
call <A HREF="014_L2_DosCloseSem.html">DosCloseSem</A> to release the semaphore
handles.
<P>
If a process has created an exclusive system semaphore and terminates while
the semaphore is open, ownership of the semaphore is transferred to the
thread executing any exit list routines. If no exit list routines have been
identified to the system with <A HREF="036_L2_DosExitList.html">DosExitList</A>,
the system closes the handle to the semaphore.
<P>
In addition to controlling access to serially reusable resources, a nonexclusive
system semaphore is also used to signal an event, such as the removal of
an element from a queue, to other processes. A process that sets the semaphore
waits for another process to clear the semaphore, signaling the event. When
the signaling process issues a <A HREF="135_L2_DosSemClear.html">DosSemClear</A>,
any waiting threads resume execution. Calls that support setting and waiting
upon a nonexclusive semaphore by one or more threads are <A HREF="137_L2_DosSemSet.html">DosSemSet</A>,
<A HREF="139_L2_DosSemWait.html">DosSemWait</A>,  <A HREF="138_L2_DosSemSetWait.html">DosSemSetWait</A>,
and <A HREF="089_L2_DosMuxSemWait.html">DosMuxSemWait</A>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a thread needs to signal another thread of the same process,
a RAM semaphore is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
