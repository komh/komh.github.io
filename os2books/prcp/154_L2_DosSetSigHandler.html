</UL><B>Remarks</B>
<P>
When the signal indicated by SigNumber occurs, the signal handling routine
receives control with:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>SS:SP)<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Far return address<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> SigArg furnished on the <A HREF="043_L2_DosFlagProcess.html">DosFlagProcess
</A>request, if appropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Other than SS, SP, CS, IP and flags, all registers contain the same values
they contained at the time the signal was received. The handler may exit
by executing an intersegment return instruction, or by manually setting
the stack frame to some known state and jumping to some known location.
 If the former option is selected, execution resumes where it was interrupted,
and all registers are restored to their values at the time of the interruption.

<P>
The signal handler is given control under the first thread<!-- entering slot 190 -->
of a process, not a thread created by the <A HREF="020_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
</A>system request. It is invalid to issue this system call when thread
1 has terminated.  If thread 1 terminates with other threads still active,
all signals are reset to the default action.
<P>
To return from the signal, the handler must remove the signal number and
signal argument passed as parameters.  For handlers written in most high-level
languages, this is done automatically.  A handler written in assembler language
must execute a Far RET 4 instruction or its equivalent, to return to the
caller. The signal handler may also reset the stack pointer to some previous
valid stack frame and jump to some other part of the program.
<P>
The values returned in PrevAddress and PrevAction are to be used for restoring
the previous signal handler when the current process no longer wishes to
intercept this signal.  For Action = 4, no values are returned for PrevAddress
or PrevAction.
<P>
When a signal is issued from the base keyboard device driver in response
to a Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break key press, the default action terminates the process
if the application did not install a signal handler for any signal numbers
1-4.
<P>
For signals of type SIGINTR or SIGBREAK, a call to DosSetSigHandler also
determines which process within the current session is signalled as a result
of a device driver call to Device Helper Services for the SendEvent function
and CTRL-C (or CTRL-BREAK) event type.  (See the IBM Operating System/2
Version 1.2 I/O Subsystems And Device Support Volume 1, Device Helper Services
discussion). This process is known as the `signal focus" for SIGINTR (or
SIGBREAK) within its session.  The signal focus for SIGINTR need not be
the same process as the signal focus for SIGBREAK.  The determination for
signal focus follows.
<P>
Initially, a session has no signal focus for SIGINTR (or SIGBREAK).  A process
becomes the signal focus for SIGINTR ( or SIGBREAK) within its session if
it calls DosSetSigHandler with ActionCode equal to 1, 2, or 3. A process
remains the signal focus until:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The process terminates.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The process calls DosSetSigHandler with ActionCode
equal to zero.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Another process calls DosSetSigHandler with
ActionCode equal to 1, 2, or 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In the first two cases, the parent or its closest related ancestor process
that has a handler installed for the appropriate signal becomes the focus.
 If no eligible process exists, the session ceases to have a signal focus
for that signal.
<P>
If a device driver makes a SendEvent call for CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK and the
current session has no focus for the corresponding signal, all processes
in the session are signaled with SIGTERM to terminate.
<P>
<B>Family API Considerations</B>
<P>
Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in OS/2 mode.  Therefore,
the following restriction applies to DosSetSigHandler when coding in DOS
mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The only signals recognized in DOS are SIGINTR (Ctrl-C)
and SIGBREAK.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The option
Action=3 generates an "invalid signal number" error.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>If
SigNumber is any value other than SIGINTR or SIGBREAK, then an "invalid
signal number" error is generated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
SIGINTR is fully supported, and SIGBREAK is related to SIGINTR. Therefore,
if SIGINTR is specified, both SIGINTR and SIGBREAK are transferred to the
SIGINTR handler.  SIGBREAK is permitted as a coded value, but the request
to set SIGBREAK is ignored.  To be compatible in all environments, SIGBREAK
and SIGINTR should be considered together in all cases.
