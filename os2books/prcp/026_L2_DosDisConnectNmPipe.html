<P>
The server process of a named pipe issues DosDisConnectNmPipe followed by
<A HREF="015_L2_DosConnectNmPipe.html">DosConnectNmPipe</A> to prepare the
pipe for the next client.
<P>
If the client end of the pipe is open when DosDisConnectNmPipe is issued,
it is forced to close, and the client gets an error code on its next operation.
Forcing the client end to close may cause data to be discarded that has
not yet been read by the client.  If the client end is currently closing
(DosClose has been issued), DosDisConnectNmPipe acknowledges the close and
makes the pipe available to be opened by the next client after a <A HREF="015_L2_DosConnectNmPipe.html">DosConnectNmPipe
</A>is issued.
<P>
A client that gets forced off a pipe by a DosDisConnectNmPipe must issue
<A HREF="012_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose</A> to free the handle resource.
Although DosDisConnectNmPipe makes the client's handle invalid, it does
not free the client's handle.
<P>
Any threads that are blocked on the pipe are awakened by DosDisConnectNmPipe.
 A thread blocked on the pipe by a <A HREF="173_L2_DosWrite.html">DosWrite
</A>returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.  A thread blocked on the pipe by a <A HREF="124_L2_DosRead.html">DosRead
</A>returns BytesRead = 0, indicating EOF.
