<P>
The types of queued events are directly affected by the current value of
the Mouse EventMask.  <A HREF="603_L2_MouSetEventMask.html">MouSetEventMask
</A>is used to indicate the types of events desired, and <A HREF="590_L2_MouGetEventMask.html">MouGetEventMask
</A>is used to query the current value of the mask.  Refer to these functions
for further explanation of the masking of events.
<P>
Recognition of the mouse transition depends on the use of MouState returned
in the event record.  The application should focus on bit transitions that
occur in this word.  It is important to properly set the event mask with
<A HREF="603_L2_MouSetEventMask.html">MouSetEventMask</A> for reporting
the state transitions.
<P>
MouState reports the state of the mouse that resulted from the action that
caused the event.  The action can be pressing or releasing a button, and/or
moving the mouse.  All status is given, regardless of the EventMask that
was used to determine whether or not to report the event.
<P>
For example, assume the EventMask indicates that the application wishes
only button 1 event.  The EventMask has only bits 1 and 2 set in this case.
 Also assume the current state of the mouse is no buttons down, and mouse
is not moving.  At this point, button 1 is pressed causing an event; the
status shows button 1 down (bit 2 set).  Next the mouse is moved, thereby
causing more events; status shows bit 1 set.  Finally, mouse is stopped
and button 1 is released.  The event shows status with no bits set.
<P>
Next, button 2 is pressed.  No event occurs.  Mouse is then moved; again,
no event.  Then, while mouse is still in motion, button 1 is pressed; an
event is generated with bits 1 and 3 set in the state word. While mouse
is still in motion, both buttons are released.  Because button 1 changes
states, an event occurs.  The state word has bit 0 set.  Finally, mouse
is stopped.  No event occurs, again because no button 1 transition has taken
place.
<P>
The Row and Column fields in the Buffer Parameter may contain either absolute
display coordinates or relative mouse motion in mickeys. See <A HREF="602_L2_MouSetDevStatus.html">MouSetDevStatus
</A>for additional<!-- entering slot 645 -->  information.
