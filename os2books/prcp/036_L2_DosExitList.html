The low-order byte indicates the operation being performed by DosExitList,
which can be used to update the list of routines, or to transfer to the
next address on the termination list at the completion of a routine. The
values of the byte and their meanings are:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> The high-order byte indicates
the invocation order. This value is valid only when the low-order byte is
1 (add an address).  For the other low-order byte values, the high-order

<UL> The
invocation order determines the order in which routines are invoked. Routines
given a value of 0 are invoked first and routines with a value of 255 are
invoked last. If more than one routine is added with the same invocation
order value, the last routine to be added is invoked first. The following
values are used by OS/2 components:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<P>
DosExitList maintains a list of addresses to routines that receive control
when a process is terminated.  These addresses must be in the address space
of the terminating process. DosExitList routines perform clean-up operations
on resources. For example, DosExitList can be used in a dynamic link library
module to free resources and semaphores after a client program has ended.

<P>
During DosExitList processing, the process is in a state of partial termination.
 All threads of the process are terminated, except for the one executing
the routines.  Ownership of any exclusive semaphores created by the process
with <A HREF="019_L2_DosCreateSem.html">DosCreateSem</A> was transferred
to the DosExitList thread, so the thread can access protected resources.
Termination routines should be short and fail-safe, so there is minimum
delay in completing process termination.
<P>
Before transferring control to the termination routines, OS/2 resets the
stack to its initial value. Transfer is by way of a JMP instruction. The
first parameter on the stack (located at SS:SP+4) contains an indicator
of why the process ended. The meanings of values returned are the same as
those for termination codes returned by <A HREF="021_L2_DosCwait.html">DosCwait
</A>or  <A HREF="033_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> requests. These
values are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->EXIT (normal exit)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Hard error abort<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Trap operation<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Unintercepted <A HREF="075_L2_DosKillProcess.html">DosKillProcess</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each routine on the list receives control in numeric order by function high-order
byte. For example, low (0) is first with high (0FFH) being last.  In case
of duplicate entries for the same value, the routines are executed in LIFO
order.
<P>
When a routine has completed its processing, it issues<!-- entering slot 43 -->
DosExitList with function = 3. Control is then transferred to the next address
in the invocation order. If a routine on the list does not issue DosExitList
at the completion of its processing, the process hangs, and OS/2 prevents
termination. When all addresses are serviced, the process completes exiting.

<P>
Most OS/2 system calls are valid in a DosExitList routine; however, certain
functions such as <A HREF="020_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
</A>and <A HREF="033_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> are not. Functions
requested in a routine must not be higher in the function code order hierarchy
than the invocation order specified for the routine.
