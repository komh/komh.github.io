<H1>Pointing Device Support</H1><!-- entering slot 166 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides support for some of the popular pointing devices
such the IBM PS/2 mouse and several mouse types which attach to the serial
port.  Some pointing devices are supplied with their own device drivers.
 An example of this is the Hewlett-Packard** (HP) mouse. Support for these
devices can only be activated after installation of OS/2 V2.0 is completed.
The OS/2 V2.0 installation will have to be carried out using the keyboard.
During the installation, install support for the IBM PS/2 style pointing
device.
<P>
After the system has been restarted, support for the pointing device can
be installed. This installation will usually involve copying one or more
device drivers to the<I> \OS2</I> directory and updating the CONFIG.SYS.
In the case of the HP mouse and assuming OS/2 is installed on the C: partition,
the steps involved are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

directory from the diskette supplied with the mouse<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Update the CONFIG.SYS as follows:
