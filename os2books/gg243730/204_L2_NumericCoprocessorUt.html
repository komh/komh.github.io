<H1>Numeric Coprocessor Utilization</H1><!-- entering slot 227 -->
<P>
The 80386 processor may operate in conjunction with, and utilize the features
of either the Intel 80287 or 80387 numeric coprocessors.  When the system
is initialized, the presence of a numeric coprocessor, and its type if present,
is checked by the 80386.  If an 80287 coprocessor is detected, the 80386
automatically converts all memory transfers to 16-bit format. If an 80387
is detected, it is used in 32-bit mode, thereby utilizing the full potential
of both the 80386 and 80387.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> IBM does not support or recommend the use of 80287 numeric
coprocessors in 80386-based systems.  For a list of supported numeric coprocessors
for each system unit, readers should refer to the appropriate IBM Product
Announcement for that system unit.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
