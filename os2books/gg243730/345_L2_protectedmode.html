Mode of operation for the Intel 80286 and 80386/80486 processors, whereby
the address space is expanded to 16MB (80286) or 4GB (80386/80486), and
memory references are translated via segment selector and offset, enabling
full memory protection between processes executing in the system.  With
the 80386/80486, paging is available in protected mode.
