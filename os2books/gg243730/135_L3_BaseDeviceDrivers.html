<H1>Base Device Drivers</H1><!-- entering slot 150 -->
<P>
In order to be more flexible in providing support for OEM machines, OS/2
Version 2.0 introduces a new class of device driver, a base device driver.
 A base device driver is one which is needed during the loading of the operating
system.  In order to identify and initiate the loading of base device drivers
a new CONFIG.SYS statement<B> BASEDEV</B> is introduced.  The<B> BASEDEV
</B>statement is used to load support for disks, diskettes and printer devices.

<P>
Only the name of the base device driver is included on the<B> BASEDEV</B> statement
as base device drivers are load during an early stage of OS/2 initialization
and there is insufficient support available at this point to process a path.
 Base device drivers are installed in the root directory of the partition
from which OS/2 is loaded or alternatively in the \OS2 directory in that
partition.
<P>
The<B> BASEDEV</B> statement makes it possible to specify the device drivers
required for system initialization.  In previous releases of OS/2 this information
was included as part of the system loader and this restricted the range
of hardware that these releases could support.
