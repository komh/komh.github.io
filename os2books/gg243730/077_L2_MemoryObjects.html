<H1>Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
A memory object is the term used under OS/2 Version 2.0 for a linear, contiguous
range of memory addresses, which is regarded and manipulated as a single
logical unit by an application.  A memory object is actually composed of
one or more discrete 4KB pages, and is viewed as such by the operating system.
 With minor exceptions however, an application need not be aware of the
paged nature of a memory object, since OS/2 Version 2.0 handles all paging
internally.  See <A HREF="083_L2_PhysicalMemoryManage.html">Physical Memory
Management</A> for further discussion of paging.
<P>
Each process under OS/2 Version 2.0 uses memory objects, and all memory
allocation and sharing from an application viewpoint is based on memory
objects. The reader may conceptually regard memory objects as similar to
segments, but the means of addressing memory objects is greatly simplified,
since there is no need to construct the address using a segment selector.
