IBM* OS/2* Version 2.0 is an advanced multitasking, single-user operating
system for IBM Personal System/2* computers and other machines equipped
with the Intel** 80386** or compatible microprocessors.  It inherits a rich
set of features from previous versions of OS/2, such as support for multitasking,
multiple threads, dynamic linking, interprocess communication, a graphical
user interface, and a graphics programming interface.  Features such as
a High Performance File System, Extended Attributes, and long filenames
are also available in OS/2 Version 2.0.

<A HREF="007_L2_TheNewOS2Version20Lo.html">Figure "The New OS/2 Version
2.0 Logo"</A>
<P>
Unlike previous versions of OS/2, Version 2.0 takes advantage of the advanced
features of the Intel 80386 processor architecture, such as a 32-bit memory
model, paged virtual memory, and an enhanced processor instruction set.
More extensive use is also made of IBM's Micro Channel* architecture for
improved hardware performance.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 requires the features of the Intel 80386 or compatible
32-bit microprocessors, and therefore does not run on computers that use
the Intel 80286** processor, or its predecessors.  In order to maintain
compatibility, OS/2 Version 2.0  supports applications written for previous
versions of OS/2 by providing both a 16-bit as well as a 32-bit application
programming interface, allowing existing applications to execute under OS/2
Version 2.0 without modification.  Note, however, that only the 32-bit interface
provides the full features and performance of OS/2 Version 2.0, and that
while existing OS/2 Version 1.x applications will execute under OS/2 Version
2.0, they must be modified in order to take full advantage of the new features
of Version 2.0.
