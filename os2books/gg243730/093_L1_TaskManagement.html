<P>
The task management component of OS/2 Version 2.0 controls the execution
and dispatching of processes and threads started by the user or by applications.
 The design objective of task management in OS/2 Version 2.0 was to meet
the following criteria:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Support<I> all</I> existing 16-bit applications written
for previous versions of OS/2<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Support the development and execution of 32-bit applications
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Relieve system constraints on resources such as threads
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Simplify the management of processes and threads within
applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This chapter discusses the implementation of task management under OS/2
Version 2.0 in order to satisfy these criteria.
