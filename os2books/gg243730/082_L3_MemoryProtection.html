<H1>Memory Protection</H1><!-- entering slot 87 -->
<P>
With the flat memory model, OS/2 V2.0 implements memory protection using
two machine states (user and supervisor) and by providing separate address
spaces for the supervisor and each of the processes running in the system.
The global address space encompasses the entire linear address space and
consists of the system region and the current process's address space.  The
global address space is only accessible when the processor is running at
ring 0, which is reserved for the operating system.  All other processes
run in ring 3 (privilege level 3). The ring protection architecture of the
80386 processor is described in <A HREF="198_L3_PrivilegeLevels.html">Privilege
Levels</A>. While executing at ring 3, the system region is not visible
to the current process. Neither are the addresses spaces of any of the other
processes running in the system accessible.
<P>
Since memory is managed by the operating system on a page-by-page basis,
even the allocation of a 1 byte memory object will actually reserve a full
page (4KB) in memory.  Furthermore, as the memory protection scheme has
also changed under OS/2 Version 2.0, a memory reference outside the expected
range but within the 4KB page boundary will<I> not</I> give the Trap 000D
segmentation violation experienced in previous versions of OS/2. Instead,
an exception is generated only when an invalid page is referenced or an
invalid access occurs (such as write operation to a page previously declared
as read-only).  An invalid page is a page that has not been committed in
the process address space or is outside the limit of the address space.

<P>
Here is where we see a major difference between the<I> segmented</I> memory
model and the<I> linear</I> or<I> flat</I> memory model.  A 32-bit program
can address the entire 4GB address space with a 32-bit offset.  Memory is
seen as a single continuum.  16-bit applications see memory as discrete
areas each with their own defined size. 16-bit applications running under
OS/2 V2.0 are subject to segment limit checking and generally behave as
they did under previous versions of OS/2.  The discussion here refers to
32-bit applications.
<P>
For example, an application may request the allocation of 1KB of memory;
the operating system will allocate a full 4KB page.  The application can
then write up to 4096 bytes of data into the memory object, and the operating
system will not detect an error.  However, if the application attempts to
write 4097 bytes into the memory object, a general protection exception
(Trap 000D) may occur.  Such an exception is<I> only</I> generated when
the next page in the process address space is invalid. If the next page
exists in the process address space, no exception is generated.
<P>
Note that any of these exceptions may be trapped and processed using exception
handlers registered by the application.  See <A HREF="093_L1_TaskManagement.html">Task
Management</A> for further discussion of exception handling.
<P>
Since 32-bit programs can address the entire address space with a 32-bit
offset, it is easier for 32-bit programs to corrupt data in the shared region
than for 16-bit programs.  OS/2 V2.0 provides a facility for DLL routines
to have their shared data areas allocated in a<I> protected</I> area of
memory, which is not accessible to 32-bit programs, thereby providing a
level of protection.  There is a new<B> PROTECT</B> option on the<B> MEMMAN
</B>statement in the CONFIG.SYS, which is used to enable memory protection
for DLLs.
