<P>
The limit field in each segment descriptor is used by the processor to prevent
a program addressing memory outside the segment through the use of an overly
large offset value.  During address translation, the offset value specified
in the memory reference is compared with the limit field, and an exception
is generated if the offset is larger than the limit for that segment.  The
limit field in general prevents errors in one program from corrupting other
programs' code or data areas.
