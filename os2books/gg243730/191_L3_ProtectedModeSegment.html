<H1>Protected Mode (Segmented Memory Model)</H1><!-- entering slot 212 -->
<P>
When the 80386 is switched to protected mode by a software command, the
full 32-bit capabilities of the processor are enabled, and the system's
physical address space is increased to 4GB.  Since virtual memory support
is enabled in protected mode, the virtual address space visible to an application
increases to a theoretical maximum of 64 terabytes.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> In OS/2 Version 2.0, the process address space is limited
to 512MB in order to reserve memory for operating system use and to retain
full compatibility with applications written for previous versions of OS/2,
which used 16-bit addressing.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
Each process occupies a separate logical address space, and the 80386 provides
full memory protection between the address spaces of different processes,
thereby preventing an application from inadvertently accessing and/or corrupting
memory used by another application.  Note, however, that under OS/2 Version
2.0, multiple threads may be created within a single process, and dispatched
independently by the operating system. These threads share a common address
space, and it is therefore the responsibility of the application developer
to ensure correct behavior of and synchronization between multiple threads
within a single process.
<P>
In protected mode, the 16-bit segment registers are used in conjunction
with a 32-bit offset to give a 48-bit selector:offset pointer.  The segment
registers no longer contain the segment base address; rather, they contain
an index into a<B> descriptor table</B>. The entries in the descriptor table
each point to the start of a segment in physical memory.
<P>
Of the 16 bits which make up the segment selector, two bits are used to
specify the privilege level of the segment, and one bit is used to select
between the <A HREF="298_L2_globaldescriptortabl.html"><B>global descriptor
table</B> (GDT)</A> and a <A HREF="314_L2_localdescriptortable.html"><B>local
descriptor table</B> (LDT)</A>. The GDT is used by the operating system
or privileged software to maintain control over all segments within the
system.  A unique LDT is maintained for each process and used to control
only the memory segments used by that process.  In this way, each process
is prevented from accessing the memory used by another process. The remaining
13 bits are used as the index into the appropriate descriptor table. A logical
address which consists of a selector and offset is converted into a 32-bit
linear address by extracting the segment base address from the descriptor
table by using the selector as the index, then adding the offset to the
base address.  With paging disabled, the linear address equates the physical
memory address. This address translation operation is shown in <A HREF="035_L2_ProtectedModeAddress.html">Figure
"Protected Mode Addressing - without Paging"</A>. The virtual address space,
which can consist of up to 16,383 segments of 4GB each, is thus mapped to
the physical 4GB address space.  The descriptor also contains access information
for the segment along with the segment size.  The access information and
segment size is used by the processor to implement memory protection.
<P>
The maximum allowable value for the offset, and thus the maximum size of
a segment, is defined by two things.  Each entry in a descriptor table contains
a 20-bit limit field.  These 20 bits allow a maximum segment size of 1MB,
using the byte as the unit of size.
<P>
However, the descriptor table entry also contains a<B> granularity bit</B>,
which specifies that either the byte or the<I> page</I> may be used as the
unit of size in the limit field.  When using page granularity, the 20 bits
in the limit field represent a multiple of 4KB, allowing a segment size
of 4KB to 4GB.
