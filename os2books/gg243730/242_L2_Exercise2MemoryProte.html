<H1>Exercise 2 - Memory Protection</H1><!-- entering slot 268 -->
<P>
This exercise demonstrates the different memory attributes used for different
types of memory access, and the resulting impact on the allowed usage of
memory (read or write).  The access types used in this lab exercise are
READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE. The effect of not committing pages and accessing
a guarded page is also shown.
<P>
In this exercise, the student is required to run the program:
<PRE>               <B>MEMLAB2.EXE</B>
</PRE>

<P>
This program does the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Asks for the amount of memory to be allocated
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Asks for the type of allocation:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->PAG_COMMIT and PAG_READ<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->PAG_COMMIT and PAG_WRITE<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->PAG_COMMIT and PAG_EXECUTE<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->PAG_COMMIT and PAG_GUARD and PAG_WRITE<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->PAG_WRITE<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
3.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>Asks whether to READ or WRITE to this memory<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
4.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>Allocates the memory with the requested attributes
and either reads from or writes to this memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The program listing is shown in <A HREF="244_L3_SourceCodeMEMLAB2C.html">Source
Code MEMLAB2.C</A>.
<P>
This program should be run a number of times during the course of the exercise,
trying the different attributes and reading from/writing to the memory allocated.

<P>
<B>If you are able to do the exercise </B> Please do so now.  If not, refer
to the following explanation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
