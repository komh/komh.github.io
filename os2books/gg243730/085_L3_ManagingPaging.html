<P>
Pages can have the following types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Fixed</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> These are pages that are permanently
resident in storage.  They may not be moved or swapped out to secondary
storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Swappable</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> When
there is a shortage of physical memory, these pages can be swapped to disk.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Discardable</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> It is
possible to reload these pages from either an EXE or a  DLL file. When memory
becomes overcommitted, space used for discardable pages can be freed up,
and when the pages are required again they are loaded from the original
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Invalid</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> These
are pages that have been allocated but not committed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The operating system needs information over and above that contained in
the page directories and the page tables to manage the paging process. OS/2
V2.0 builds three arrays of data structures that represent:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Committed pages in the process and system address
spaces<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Pages in physical memory<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Pages held on secondary storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
The following sections describe these arrays and the way in which OS/2 V2.0
uses them.
<P>
<B>Virtual Pages</B>
<P>
A virtual page structure (VP) is allocated whenever a page is committed
in response to an application request.  No physical memory is allocated
for the page at this time.  The PTE is updated to point to the VP but the
present bit in the page table is<I> not</I> set. When the page is first
referenced, a page fault occurs.  The allocation of physical memory is left
to the last possible moment.
<P>
The virtual page structure describes the current disposition of a page.
When a page fault occurs, the virtual memory manager obtains the address
of the VP from the page table entry, and uses the information held in the
VP to determine the required action which must be taken to resolve the page
fault. The possible actions are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The page manager will provide a page, initialized
to zeros if required<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The page will be loaded from an EXE or DLL file<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The page will be loaded from the swap file on secondary
storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If the page is to be loaded from an EXE or DLL, the VP contains a pointer
to the loader block. If from the swap file, it points to a page in the swap
file.
<P>
<B>Page Frames</B>
<P>
A page frame (PF) exists for each page of physical memory in the system.
 Page frames are stored in an array, which is indexed by the physical frame
number within the system.
<P>
A page frame may have one of three states:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Free</I>, in which case the page frame is available
for allocation to a process in the system.  The page frame addresses of
all the free pages in the system are held in a doubly linked list known
as the<I> free list</I>, with PFs for fast planar memory at one end of the
list, and PFs for the slower memory on adapters at the other end.  This
permits the allocation of faster memory before the slower memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>In-use</I>, in which case the page has been allocated
to the current process in the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Idle</I>, in which case the page frame has been
allocated to a process, but no page table entries for the current process
reference this frame. This lack of reference normally indicates that the
process, which is using the page, has been switched out; that is, the process
is<I> not</I> the current process.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When the system is overcommitted, the number of free and idle page frames
begins to fall.  When it reaches a threshold level, pages are migrated from
the in-use state to the idle state by a <A HREF="328_L2_pageager.html"><B>page
ager</B></A>. The page ager looks for pages that have not been accessed
since the last time the page ager ran.  The ager examines the accessed bit
in the PTE.  If clear, it marks the page not present.  If a page is referenced
by more than one PTE, a shared page, all PTEs must be marked not present
before the page is placed on the idle list. The<I> idle list</I> is also
a doubly linked list and least recently used (LRU) entries are at one end
of the list and most recently used (MRU) entries are at the other end of
the list.
<P>
Pages are also classified as<I> dirty</I> or<I><!-- entering slot 91 --> clean</I>.
 A dirty page is one that has been written to and must have its contents
swapped to disk before it can be allocated to another process.  A clean
page does not need to be swapped out, since it typically contains code or
read-only data, which can be reloaded from the original file on disk.  It
could also be that a copy of the page currently exists in the swap file.

<P>
Placing a page frame on the<I> idle list</I> does not destroy its contents.
 The page frame is only reused when the operating system is forced to<I> steal
</I>a page frame from the<I> idle list</I> in order to accommodate the loading
of a page after a page fault. The swapping of an idle swappable page to
disk is also usually delayed until there is a need to reuse the page frame
to satisfy a page fault.  To take advantage of the capability of certain
I/O adapters to chain operations, other pages on the idle list may be swapped
out at the same time.
<P>
<B>Swap Frames</B>
<P>
A swap frame (SF) is similar to a page frame except that an SF refers to
a slot in the swap file, which can be used to hold a page when main storage
becomes overcommitted. The swap frame array is used to control allocation
of space in the swap file. If the<B> SWAP</B> option is present on the<B> MEMMAN
</B>statement in the CONFIG.SYS, the SWAPPER.DAT file will be created in
the directory pointed to in the<B> SWAPPATH</B> statement.  The initial
size of the file is 512KB.
<P>
The size of the swap file is determined by the amount of memory overcommitment
in the system.  The algorithm used in this calculation takes into account
the amount of storage needed for all the fixed pages and swappable pages
in the system and the amount by which this exceeds the physical storage
installed in the system.  The memory overcommitment is recalculated each
time pages are committed.  It should not be necessary to increase the size
of the swap file each time pages are committed because of the fact that
increases to the swap file will always be in steps of 512KB.
<P>
However allocation of VPs to SFs does not take place when the page is committed.
All the operating system ensures at this time is that there will be space
in the swap file for the page when it becomes necessary to swap it out.
 The SF is allocated to the page when it is first selected from the idle
list for swapping.  When the page is swapped back in, the SF will not be
immediately freed up, but a link to the VP is maintained. If the page is
then again selected for swapping out before it has been changed, it will
not be necessary to write it to disk as a copy of it still exists in the
swap file.
<P>
The OS/2 V2.0 swap file can also decrease in size.  Decrements to the size
of the swap file will be in 512KB blocks. When the overcommitment calculation
indicates that the swap file is too large by one or more multiples of 512KB,
the area at the end of the swap file is marked for shrinking. No new allocations
of SFs in the area marked for shrinking will take place.  When all SFs in
the shrinkable area are free, the swap file is reduced in size. No attempt
is made to force the freeing of SFs in this area; consequently there can
be a longish delay in the swap file becoming eligible for shrinking and
the shrinking actually taking place.
