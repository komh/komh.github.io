<H1>Virtual Memory Management</H1><!-- entering slot 85 -->
<P>
The virtual address space is split into two regions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>System Region</B>
<P>
This is the region above the 512MB, which is only accessible to tasks running
at operating system privilege level.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Process Region</B>
<P>
This is the first 512MB of the virtual address and only memory objects in
this region are mapped into a process's address space when that process
is running at user privilege level.  Each process present in the system
has its own mapping of this region. The process region is further split
into:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A shared area
<P>
This is used to hold shared memory objects such as DLL code and shared data
areas.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A private area
<P>
This contains EXE code and process private data.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
In order to manage virtual memory, OS/2 V2.0 uses the concept of an<B> arena</B>.
There are three arena types in the system:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The system arena<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The shared arena<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Per-process private arenas.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
Associated with each arena is the virtual address space, which it maps.
The system arena contains all the memory objects that are in the system
region. It maps the virtual address space between 512MB and 4GB. The shared
arena describes all the shared memory objects in the process region.
<P>
Each process has its own private arena, which contains EXE code and the
process's private data. The private arena starts at the lowest address of
the process region's virtual address space and has a minimum size of 64MB.
A program loaded into the address space will be loaded at the low end of
the address space. Because of this, a particular EXE will always occupy
the same range of addresses.  If a program is used by more than one process
it is possible to share one copy of the program code.
<P>
The shared arena is allocated starting at the top end of the process region
and moves down towards the private arena. It has a minimum size of 64MB.
The upper limit of the private arena and the lower limit of the shared move
towards one another. Each object in the shared arena is allocated its own
linear address range. It will have the same address range in each of the
process address spaces, into which it is mapped.
<P>
Each process has its own address space, which maps memory objects in the
process's private arena and the shared arena. Only those objects in the
shared arena, which a process requires access to and is authorized to access,
will be mapped into the process's address space.
<P>

Layout"</A>
<P>
Both private and shared storage for memory objects may be allocated within
each arena. For example, DLL instance data is located within the shared
memory arena, but each instance of the data uses a separate memory object
in order to preserve data integrity, and hence each memory object is treated
as private storage.  Although separate memory objects, they each map to
the same range of addresses in the shared arena. <A HREF="053_L2_MemoryObjectClasses.html">Table
"Memory Object Classes"</A> shows the types of storage (private or shared)
available within each memory arena, and the uses to which these types of
storage may be put by applications.
<P>
Private storage in the private arena is used for read/write data, allocated
at either loadtime or runtime, which is accessed only by a single process.
Shared storage in the private arena is used for executable code, which may
be shared between processes.
<P>
Shared storage in the shared arena is used for DLL code and read-only data,
as well as DLL read/write data, which is not instance-specific.  Such objects
may be accessed by all processes in the system.  Private storage in the
shared arena is used for DLL instance data, which is unique to each process
accessing the DLL.
