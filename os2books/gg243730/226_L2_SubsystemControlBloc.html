<H1>Subsystem Control Block Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 250 -->
<P>
The bus master in Micro Channel-based systems is capable of transferring
data on the system channel without intervention from the system controller.
Typically the system processor issues a request to the bus master. The bus
master then takes charge and controls all further operations required to
complete the request. The operations might be:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Issuing control commands to physical devices attached
to the bus master<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Data transfers to or from the physical device<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Data transfer across the Micro Channel to or from
system memory<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Handling exception conditions<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Notifying the system processor of completion of the
operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
To utilize the power of the bus master we need an effective method of communicating
control instructions to it.
<P>
The <A HREF="349_L2_SCB.html"><B>Subsystem Control Block (SCB)</B></A> architecture
defines logical protocols and services needed to transfer commands, data,
and status information between the system processor and a bus master adapter
and between two bus master adapters. The term<I> subsystem</I> is used since
the advanced function adapters are much more than simple interfaces to peripheral
devices. These adapters typically have some<I> intelligence</I> built into
them in the form of local processing power and can be regarded as "systems
within a system".
<P>
The SCB architecture provides a powerful means of communication between
device drivers running in the system processor and I/O processors that are
capable of operation independently from the system processor. The architecture
defines a control block structure for use between functional entities in
a base system processor and functional entities in advanced function adapters.
Entities are defined as either<I> client</I> or<I> server</I>.<I> Client
</I>entities make requests of<I> server</I> entities. The architecture also
defines the way that control blocks are passed between entities in the system
processor and entities in the feature adapters, or between entities in two
adapters (peer-to-peer communication).
<P>
The SCB architecture sees the system unit and each adapter logically structured
into three levels:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<I> physical level</I> handles the transfer of
the control information and data across the Micro Channel. It accesses either
the MCA-defined I/O address space or memory address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<I> delivery level</I> is an interface between
the physical level and the processing level. It uses the services provided
by the physical level to transfer requests and replies between processing
level entities.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->At the<I> processing level</I> we have the client
and server entities. The client builds and sends requests to the server
and the client receives replies in response.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
We will now discuss the SCB architecture and the manner, in which it is
implemented in the IBM SCSI adapters.
