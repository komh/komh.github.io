<H1>SETBOOT Utility</H1><!-- entering slot 184 -->
<P>
The SETBOOT utility provides a command line interface which enables the
user to configure the parameters associated with the Boot Manager environment.

<P>
Invoking the SETBOOT utility is achieved using the following command:
<PRE>&lt;Drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt; <B>SETBOOT</B> parameter &lt;:value&gt;

</PRE>
where<I> parameter:value</I> is one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI>IBD:X<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Restarts the system from the specified
logical drive,<I> X</I>, without going through the Boot Manager menu. The
parameter<I> X</I> is the drive letter of a startable partition. If Boot
Manager is not present then only drive C can be specified.  For example,
to reboot the system immediately from drive<I> D</I> without going through
Boot Manager type:
<BR>
SETBOOT /IBD:D<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /T:x<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Sets
the time-out value of the timer for the Boot Manager selection menu.  The
specified value of<I> x</I> may be 0 to 999 or NO.  A specified value of
nnn is the time in seconds that the Boot Manager selection menu will remain
displayed before automatically starting the default logical drive. A specified
value of 0 seconds bypasses the Boot Manager selection menu entirely, booting
the default system without any intervention.  When the time-out value is
NO, the timer is disabled, leaving the Boot Manager selection menu displayed
until the user makes a selection.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /M:m<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Sets
the mode for the Boot Manager selection menu:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><I>m
</I>= n sets the mode to display only the boot names of the logical drives
marked bootable. This is the default mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><I>m</I> = a (advanced mode) sets the mode
to display additional information such as physical drive, file system type,
etc.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /Q<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Queries
the current Boot Manager environment.  Returns the default volume boot names,
time-out value, mode, and unattended operation logical drive assignments.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>/B<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Performs an shutdown
and then reboots the system, booting to the system set to the marked index
value at the time of boot.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> This is not the complete system shutdown which can be performed
via the Workplace Shell's desktop context menu. All it does is basically
flushing all file system buffers and close all currently open files. PM
Applications will not receive any message, they will just be cut off, where
ever they were left.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /X:x<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> This
is an index which indicates the logical drive to Boot Manager from which
the system is to be started:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>A
value of 0 sets Boot Manager to attended mode operation and provides for
a default system selection.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>A
value of 1 to 3 puts Boot Manager in an unattended operation mode, in which
case all attended mode functions are bypassed, including the selection menu.
This is provided as a mechanism that unattended operation can use to implement
a fallback boot sequence.  For example, if an operating system fails to
access a program to set the index, the subsequent boot will attempt to start
the next fallback system (probably a more trusted system) and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
Boot Manager will start the system from the logical drive corresponding
to the index and then, before exiting, will decrement the value by 1 so
long as the value is greater than 1.  If the value is not set by SETBOOT
before the next boot, Boot Manager will start the system from a different
logical drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /N:name<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Sets
the partition or logical drive specified by the boot name and its corresponding
index value as the operating system to be started.  Up to four pair-combinations
can be given, one for each index value, 0 to 3. A boot name is case-sensitive,
and if it contains blanks, the /N:name pair must be enclosed in quotation
marks.
<P>
The following shows the values for N:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> N = 0 assigns
the specified boot name as the default operating system.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> N
= 1 to 3 specifies the boot name to be started when the corresponding index
is chosen to start.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>  <!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> To
specify the logical drive with the boot name MYSYSTEM as the default operating
system to be started type:
<BR>
SETBOOT /0:MYSYSTEM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
SETBOOT will provide a return code and the requested information.  The information
is<!-- entering slot 185 --> output to STDOUT and can be piped and redirected.
 Return codes are 0 for successful operation and 1 for unsuccessful operation.
