<H1>16-Bit Applications in a 32-Bit Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 93 -->
<P>
One of the major concerns when developing OS/2 Version 2.0 was to ensure
compatibility with applications written for previous versions of OS/2. Since
there are a significant number of 16:16 modules and resources in existence,
consideration was also given to the coexistence and interaction of 16:16
and 0:32 modules and resources within an application, with issues such as:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI><LI>32 applications using existing 16:16 DLLs
and libraries<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->16:16 applications using 0:32 DLLs and libraries<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>Huge" segments (greater than 64KB in size).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The 16:16 applications are placed in the compatibility region and accessed
through <A HREF="362_L2_tiledlocaldescriptor.html"><B>tiled local descriptor
tables</B> (<B>LDTs</B>)</A>; see <A HREF="088_L3_AddressConversionand.html">Address
Conversion and Translation</A> for further explanation. Such applications
take advantage of the fact that memory in the compatibility region may be
addressed with both 16:16 and 0:32 addressing schemes.  Addressing memory
objects from both 16-bit and 32-bit applications is therefore quite simple,
since no physical movement of the memory object is required.  Since the
entire process address space under OS/2 Version 2.0 is located within the
compatibility region, this also means that communication between 16-bit
and 32-bit applications and modules may take place.
