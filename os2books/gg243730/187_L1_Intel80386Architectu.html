<H1>Intel 80386 Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
The Intel 80386 is a powerful 32-bit microprocessor and is the first hardware
platform on which OS/2 Version 2.0 has been implemented. The 80386 incorporates
multitasking support, sophisticated memory management, pipelined architecture,
address translation caching, and a high-speed bus interface, all combined
within the processor chip.  While the 80386 represents a significant improvement
over previous generations of Intel microprocessors, it retains software
compatibility with older 16-bit microprocessors such as the 8086 and 80286
families.
<P>
The capacity of the 80386 processor is significant.  Some figures are presented
below, in comparison with 80286 processors:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<B>Note:  </B> The 80386SX is an exception as it still is limited to a maximum
of 16MB of physical memory. Internally the 80386SX is a full 32-bit processor
but externally it has only a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
