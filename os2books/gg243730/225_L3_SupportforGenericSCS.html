<H1>Support for Generic SCSI Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 249 -->
<P>
The SCSI ABIOS provides support for two new device types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Device ID 17h - SCSI Adapter support
<P>
Functions for this device ID control the SCSI adapter, and some of them
also affect all devices attached to the adapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Device ID 18h - SCSI Peripheral Type support.
<P>
Functions for this device ID control the devices attached to the SCSI adapter.
Some functions affect all devices attached to the adapter, and others are
used to control a specific device via its logical ID.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These device types are intended for access to SCSI devices other than disk
drives. Examples of these generic types are CD-ROMs, tape devices and communication
devices, all of which may theoretically use the SCSI bus, provided the device
is designed to do so.
<P>
The logical IDs for a particular peripheral type are allocated/deallocated
to specific SCSI devices on demand via the allocate and deallocate function.
Through the allocate function the device driver specifies a SCSI peripheral
type, a removable media indicator and a relative unit number. If the device
exists and is unallocated, ABIOS assigns that device to the logical ID.
The controlling program can then use the logical ID to make requests through
the SCSI adapter.
