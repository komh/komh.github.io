<P>
Each physical disk drive in a machine is divided into <A HREF="336_L2_partition.html"><B>partitions</B></A>.
A partition defines the area of the disk that belongs to a particular operating
system.  Each disk can be divided into multiple <A HREF="342_L2_primarypartition.html"><B>primary
partitions</B></A> and/or one <A HREF="288_L2_extendedpartition.html"><B>extended
partition</B></A>. Each operating system formats its partition in its own
way; this format may or may not be supported by other operating systems.

<P>
Only one primary partition on each physical disk drive is accessible at
any one time; other primary partitions on that drive are hidden.  Boot Manager
allows up to four primary partitions on each physical disk drive.
<P>
Note that the first physical disk drive in the machine<I> must</I> have
a primary partition.
<P>
An extended partition can be created in place of one of the four primary
partitions when logical drives are desired.  All logical drives in an extended
partition are accessible at any time, regardless of which primary partition
is active, provided that the format of the logical drives is supported by
the currently active operating system.
