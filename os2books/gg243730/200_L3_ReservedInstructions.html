<P>
Certain processor instructions are reserved for execution only by the operating
system, and may therefore execute only at privilege level zero.  Such instructions
include HLT (Halt Processor), LGDT (Load GDT), and LTR (Load Task Register).

<P>
In addition, some I/O instructions are restricted:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
