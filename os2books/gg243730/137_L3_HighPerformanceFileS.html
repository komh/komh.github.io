<H1>High Performance File System Changes</H1><!-- entering slot 152 -->
<P>
The following changes have been made to the High Performance File System
(HPFS) driver under OS/2 Version 2.0:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->At initialization time, the level of support provided
by the device driver is determined using the new device command<I> 1DH -
GetDeviceSupport</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The HPFS driver passes physical addresses for data
pointers, in the appropriate request format, to the device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The HPFS driver now supports command chaining, calling
the volume manager with a list of all contiguous sector requests required
to fulfill an I/O request.
<P>
This function is supported for all DASD types.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The HPFS driver supports scatter/gather by passing
physical pointers to each page in the data buffer (physically discontiguous)
as part of the I/O request.
<P>
This allows I/O controllers such as the IBM SCSI adapters which support
the scatter/gather capability to perform the I/O in a single operation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The HPFS driver now supports disk caching in the IFS
driver, rather than in the device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The HPFS driver is able to recognize devices which
have outboard caches (non-system memory), and incorporate them into the
total caching scheme.
<P>
The HPFS file system under OS/2 Version 2.0 supports a maximum file size
of 2GB.  The maximum size for an HPFS volume is 512GB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
