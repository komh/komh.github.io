<H1>Starting Programs Automatically</H1><!-- entering slot 136 -->
<P>
While the system is starting, programs will be started as a result of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Inclusion of commands in STARTUP.CMD</B>
<P>
This command file is used exactly as it was in previous releases of OS/2.
 During installation of IBM OS/2 LAN Server components, a STARTUP.CMD file
is optionally built, which automatically starts the LAN Server components
that were installed. STARTUP.CMD is useful for running programs where:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The order in which programs run is important; one
program must complete before the next one is started<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A program must be run only if the previous program
ran successfully.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Program objects
in the</B><B><I> Startup</B></I><B> folder</B>
<P>
The<I> Startup</I> folder contains program objects which are to be run when
the Workplace Shell is started.  An example is LOGON.EXE which performs
a logon to the server.  It should not be used to start programs which are
to run continuously.  The<I> Startup</I> folder is found in the<I> OS/2
System</I> folder which appears on the OS/2 desktop.  For a detailed discussion
of folders and objects see<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation
Manager and Workplace Shell</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Programs not closed before the last system shutdown</B>
<P>
All programs that were started and were still running when the system was
last shutdown will be restarted when the system is next started.  This is
the preferred method for starting those programs which will run continuously.
 An example is the Communications Manager when it is used to provide host
terminal emulation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
It possible to suppress automatically starting programs from the Startup
folder and programs that were not closed. During startup of the Workplace
Shell after rebooting the operating system, press and hold the Ctrl, left
Shift and F1 keys when the white screen first appears and hold them down
till the icons appear on the screen.
