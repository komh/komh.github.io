<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a tool that can enable execution of multiple operating
systems on the same physical machine, with selection of an operating system
by the user at boottime.  This capability is provided by an OS/2 Version
2.0 feature known as <A HREF="269_L2_BootManager.html"><B>Boot Manager</B></A>.

<P>
Using Boot Manager, the user may select from various operating systems such
as DOS, OS/2 Version 1.x, OS/2 Version 2.0 or AIX.  Other operating systems
may also be supported, provided they do not directly modify the master boot
record of the fixed disk.  With this feature, OS/2 V2.0 is now capable of
installing to and initializing from a logical disk, other than C:.  For
further details on Boot Manager and its implementation, see <A HREF="152_L1_BootManager.html">Boot
Manager</A>.
