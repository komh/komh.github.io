File Allocation Table; term used to describe the file system implemented
by DOS and OS/2.  This file system uses a file allocation table to contain
the physical sector addresses of all files on the disk.  The FAT file system
is supported by OS/2 Version 2.0, along with the newer HPFS and other installable
file systems.
