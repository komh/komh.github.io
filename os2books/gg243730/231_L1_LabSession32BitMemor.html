<H1>Lab Session - 32-Bit Memory Model</H1><!-- entering slot 257 -->
<P>
This lab session provides practical experience with the 32-bit flat memory
model implemented under OS/2 Version 2.0, and demonstrates some of the new
memory management facilities that were introduced in OS/2 Version 2.0. The
exercise shows the way in which OS/2 Version 2.0 memory management differs
from the memory management in previous releases.  A look is also taken at
enhancements made in the area of thread processing.
