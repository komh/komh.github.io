<P>
The main objective of the debug component is to provide the required services
to enable developers to build powerful debugging tools. The interface provided
by the debug component is designed to be:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Powerful<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->As portable as possible<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Able to debug programs and DLLs<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Able to debug mixed or pure 16 and 32-bit applications.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The term "non-intrusive" means that debugging services must:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->In no way compromise the integrity of the operating
system<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Minimize any impact on system performance<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Have no effect on processes, other than the process
or processes being debugged.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Debuggers usually require that a program, to be debugged be preprocessed
accordingly, compiled and linked with special options.  If a program is
prepared for debugging but not actually being debugged, the debugging services
should have no impact on the execution of  the program. Particularly application
performance should not be affected in any way. These design objectives of
the OS/2 V2.0 debug component should be kept in mind by the developers of
debugging tools.
<P>
The power of the debug component is an important issue to consider when
designing and developing debugging tools. Since the debugger gains access
to the memory and registers of the application being debugged, it is the
responsibility of the debugging tool developer to ensure the correct use
of these resources to prevent deadlocks or inadvertent corruption of application
resources.
<P>
Debuggers should not be used as tools for evaluating program performance.
The debug component does not provide reliable timings for the execution
of program steps. It is useful, however, for examining the execution path
of a particular transaction through a program.
