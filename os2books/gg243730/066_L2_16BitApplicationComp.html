<H1>16-Bit Application Compatibility</H1><!-- entering slot 68 -->
<P>
An important feature of OS/2 Version 2.0 is its ability to run existing
16-bit applications, written for previous versions of OS/2, without alteration.
This compatibility is achieved internally by the operating system through
a special interface called a <A HREF="361_L2_thunk.html"><B>thunk</B></A>.
A thunk is a piece of code responsible for converting 16-bit segmented memory
references to 32-bit linear references and vice versa, as well as realigning
the thread's stack and data structures where necessary. This restructuring
allows the 16-bit applications to interface with 32-bit service layers within
the operating system, and allows 32-bit applications to utilize 16-bit service
layers, modules and resources.
<P>
Applications may also be written for the 32-bit environment, while making
use of existing 16-bit DLLs and resources.  This technique is known as <A HREF="320_L2_mixedmodelprogrammin.html"><B>mixed
model programming</B></A>, and allows the application developer to make
the best possible use of existing service routines, private window classes,
etc., developed for previous versions of OS/2.
<P>
Note, however, that the use of mixed 16-bit and 32-bit modules within an
application requires special consideration by the application developer,
since the 16-bit modules utilize the segmented memory model, and therefore
are restricted in the size and location of the memory objects to which they
have access.  The subject of mixed-model programming is discussed in greater
detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
