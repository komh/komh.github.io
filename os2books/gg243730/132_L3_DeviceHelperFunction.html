<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 still uses a 16-bit device driver model. In order to optimize
existing device drivers for the 32-bit flat memory model, new<B> DevHlp()
</B>functions have been added for memory management.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Locking specific address ranges</B>
<P>
Since paging is used in OS/2 Version 2.0, segments no longer need to be
physically contiguous in memory.  Thus, when locking these segments in memory,
the memory manager may need to "shuffle" pages to make them contiguous.

<P>
This shuffling can greatly increase the amount of time it takes to perform
the locking.  Locking of entire segments should therefore be avoided by
using the new<I> VMLock</I><B> DevHlp()</B> function, which locks<I> only
</I>the required range of addresses within a memory object.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Address context conversion without locking</B>
<P>
In previous versions of OS/2, device drivers were required to lock the user's
buffers to gain context-free addressability.  Since locking degrades performance
and reduces available pageable system memory, new<B> DevHlp()</B> functions
have been added to convert these addresses without the need for locking.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Removal of frequent selector loads</B>
<P>
Device drivers can reduce the amount of selector loading by using the new
flat memory model<B> DevHlp()</B> functions to allocate memory.  All of
the memory allocated by the new<I> VMAlloc</I><B> DevHlp()</B> function
can be addressed via one flat selector available to device drivers at initialization
time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Scatter/gather DMA support</B>
<P>
Scatter/gather DMA adapters (such as the IBM SCSI adapters described in
<A HREF="207_L1_MicroChannelArchitec.html">Micro Channel Architecture and
SCSI</A>) allow DMA operations on physically discontiguous pages of memory.
This ability provides a significant performance advantage over contiguous
DMA operations.
<P>
By using the new<I> VMLock</I><B> DevHlp()</B> function, a device driver
can specify that pages should be locked without being physically contiguous
in memory. <I> VMLock</I> will then return the physical addresses of each
page that was locked.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Address-limited devices</B>
<P>
Address-limited devices (using 24-bit addressing) do not support memory
above 16MB.  The device drivers for these products will use a new bit on
the<I> VMLock</I> and<I> VMAlloc</I> calls, which specifies that the memory
must be locked or allocated below the 16MB line.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The following are some of the new<B> DevHlp()</B> functions implemented
in OS/2 Version 2.0:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMAlloc</B></I> - Allocate block of physical
memory
<P>
<I>VMAlloc</I> is used to allocate linear and/or physical address space
in memory.  These allocations can exceed 64KB in size and can be either
fixed, movable or swappable memory.  This call can be used to map non-system
memory into the current process context.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMFree</B></I> - Free memory allocated via<I> VMAlloc
</I>
<P>
Memory allocated via<I> VMAlloc</I> can be freed with the<I> VMFree</I><B> DevHlp()
</B>function. <I> VMFree</I> is also used to remove the mappings created
by<I> VMGlobalToProcess</I> and<I> VMProcessToGlobal</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMLock</B></I> - Locks a range of memory within
a segment
<P>
<I>VMLock</I> is used to lock a linear address range into physical memory.
 If the lock is needed for scatter/gather DMA, then a list of physical page
addresses is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMUnlock</B></I> - Unlocks a range of memory
within a segment
<P>
<I>VMUnlock</I> is the counterpart of the<I> VMLock</I> function.  It is
used to unlock memory previously locked via<I> VMLock</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMProcessToGlobal</B></I> - Map process address
into global address space
<P>
The<I> VMProcessToGlobal</I><B> DevHlp()</B> function is used to convert
an address that is in the context of the current process to an address in
a global context.  This allows context-free addressability to the memory
objects of a process.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VMGlobalToProcess</B></I> - Map global address
into process address space
<P>
<I>VMGlobalToProcess</I> can be used to map a global context address into
the address space of the current process.  When used for video buffers,
the calling process can specify if the memory should be under screen group
control.  This will cause the memory to be validated or invalidated at<!-- entering slot 147 --> task
switch time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>VirtToLin</B></I> - Converts a selector:offset
address to a linear address
<P>
<I>VirtToLin</I> will convert a selector:offset address into a flat 32-bit
linear address.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>LinToGDTSelector</B></I> - Convert a linear
address to a virtual address
<P>
<I>LinToGDTSelector</I> is used to convert a linear address to a virtual
(selector:offset) address by mapping the given GDT selector to the memory
region referred to by the given linear address and range.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>PhysToGDTSel</B></I> - Maps a physical address
to a GDT selector
<P>
<I>PhysToGDTSel</I> converts a 32-bit physical address to a GDT selector:offset
pair.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>FreeGDTSelector</B></I> - Free selector allocated
via<I> AllocateGDTSelector</I>
<P>
<I>FreeGDTSelector</I> frees up a GDT selector allocated via the<I> AllocGDTSelector
</I><B>DevHlp()</B> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>PageListToGDTSelector</B></I> - Maps given physical
addresses to selector
<P>
<I>PageListToGDTSelector</I> is used to map physical addresses to a GDT
selector, setting the access byte of the descriptor to the requested type.
The virtual memory needed to map the physical ranges described by the page
list array must not exceed 64KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>GetDescInfo</B></I> - Return information on
the contents of the descriptor
<P>
<I>GetDescInfo</I> is used to return the access byte, linear address, and
size of a descriptor allocated via the<I> AllocGDTSelector</I><B> DevHlp()
</B>function.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>PageListToLin</B></I> - Maps physical pages
to a linear address
<P>
<I>PageListToLin</I> is used to map physical memory pages described in an
array of page list structures to a linear address.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>LinToPageList</B></I> - Returns the physical
pages mapped by a linear range
<P>
<I>LinToPageList</I> is used to translate a linear address range to an array
of page list structures that describe the physical pages mapped.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
