<P>
A number of changes have been made to the volume manager, in order to provide
enhanced support for SCSI adapters, and to support the new SCB architecture
request list data structures.
<P>
During the ABIOS initialization, one SCSI adapter-type logical ID (LID)
will be generated for each SCSI adapter in the system.  These LIDs cannot
be allocated by the device driver, so in order to secure access to these
LIDs, the device manager must include them in its list of LIDs.
<P>
The volume manager also supports fast path processing for the new request
list data structures.  These structures need no longer be transformed into
request packets.  However, volume verification must still be performed by
the volume manager.  This function is required since the system must support
removable media.
<P>
If the device driver written for previous versions of OS/2 is used with
the OS/2 Version 2.0 volume manager, it will give an "invalid device command"
return code to the GetDeviceSupport() command from the file system.  In
this case, the file system must be structured in a compatible form for the
device driver.  The volume manager then functions as before with no changes.
