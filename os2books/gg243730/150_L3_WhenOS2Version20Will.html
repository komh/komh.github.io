<H1>When OS/2 Version 2.0 Will Not Run</H1><!-- entering slot 167 -->
<P>
IBM has been working with a number of OEMs of IBM-compatible PCs to ensure
that OS/2 Version 2.0 will work on as wide a range of hardware as possible.

<P>
At general availability of OS/2 V2.0, a list of OEM machines that have been
tested and support OS/2 V2.0 will be published. The updating of this list
will be an ongoing process. Even if your machine appears on this list, you
will need to check if there are any special considerations for installing
OS/2 V2.0 on your machine. The dealer from whom you purchased the machine
will be able to provide you with details supplied by the manufacturer and
any special device drivers you may need.
<P>
Also to be considered is the support required for any adapters installed
in the machine, which are not normally standard for the machine. This consideration
applies to IBM PS/2s as well. For example, it is common to replace the disk
controller in older machines with a newer SCSI controller.  If this is an
IBM controller, it is not a problem. However if a controller from an OEM
is used, then a different device driver might be required.
<P>
If OS/2 V2.0 fails to run on a particular machine, these are some of the
things that can be checked:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check the documentation shipped with OS/2 V2.0
such as the online<I> README File</I>, which is found in the<I> Information
</I>folder, for any special installation considerations which apply.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If any OS/2 bulletin boards are available, access
them for any revised installation instructions or device driver requirements
for the machine's configuration.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check that the microprocessor on the system board
is from the 80386 or 80486 families of processors.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If it is an 80386 processor, check that it has
a stepping level of D0 or later.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check that at least 4MB of memory is installed
and available.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check that there is sufficient free space in
the disk partition containing SWAPPER.DAT to allow for growth of this file.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check that the BIOS/ABOIS installed is the latest
available for the machine.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check if the disk system needs a special device
driver and if there any special instructions for installing it.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check for any other device driver requirements.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>If installing on an IBM PS/2 Model 57, 90 or 95
update the system partition using the latest available reference diskette.
