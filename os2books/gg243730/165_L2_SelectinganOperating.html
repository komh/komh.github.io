<H1>Selecting an Operating System</H1><!-- entering slot 186 -->
<P>
The selection of the logical drive from which the system is to be started
is performed at IPL time.  The user is presented with a panel containing
a list of selectable logical drives. The user may explicitly select a logical
drive, or may allow the selection timer to expire and have Boot Manager
 start the system from the default logical drive without further intervention.

<P>
If the time-out value was set to zero using the SETBOOT utility or FDISK/FDISKPM,
the selection menu is circumvented and Boot Manager immediately starts the
system from the default logical drive.
<P>
If the time-out value is other than zero, the selection menu is displayed
as shown in <A HREF="031_L2_BootManagerSelection.html">Figure "Boot Manager
Selection Menu"</A>.
<P>
If no default logical drive was specified, then the last system booted becomes
the default.
<P>
The up/down cursor keys are used to select a particular logical drive.  By
default, the cursor is located at the current default logical drive.  If
more logical drives are configured in a workstation environment than lines
are available on the screen to display them, a scroll bar will appear in
the selection screen indicating to the user whether more logical drives
are available for display.
<P>
The selection menu displays the current time-out value, and the boot name
of the current default logical drive. In order to allow the user to suspend
or resume the timer while the selection menu is displayed, the Esc key may
be used in toggle mode.  The current status of the timer is displayed (enabled/disabled)
and the Esc key will toggle a status switch.
<P>
The selection menu shown in <A HREF="031_L2_BootManagerSelection.html">Figure
"Boot Manager Selection Menu"</A> is the standard mode normally seen at
power-on or IPL time.  Only the boot names of selectable logical drivers
are displayed; no additional information about the type of logical drive
and physical location is shown in order to keep the standard user interface
simple and straightforward.
<P>
However, in order to accommodate advanced users and system administrators
who wish to see more details about the available logical drives, an advanced
mode menu is available.  This advanced mode menu can be activated via an
option in FDISK, FDISKPM or via the SETBOOT utility.
<P>
The advanced mode selection menu shows not only the boot names of the logical
drives, but will also indicate the physical disk upon which the logical
drive resides, the type of partition (primary/extended), the file system
for which the logical drive was formatted, and the accessibility of the
logical drive.  The advanced mode selection menu is shown in <A HREF="032_L2_BootManagerSelection.html">Figure
"Boot Manager Selection Menu - Advanced Mode"</A>.
<P>
Note that the third column displays the partition type for a logical drive
boot name.<I> Logical</I> indicates that the drive resides in an extended
partition.
<P>
The fifth column displays the accessibility of the logical drive. <I> Hidden
</I>means the system will not have access to this volume;  however, if a
hidden boot name is selected as the logical drive from which to start the
system, Boot Manager will "unhide" it.  Boot Manager will automatically
hide any other primaries on that physical drive, since only one primary
partition may be active at any time.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Only primary partitions can be marked as hidden, extended
logical drives (partitions) are always accessible.
