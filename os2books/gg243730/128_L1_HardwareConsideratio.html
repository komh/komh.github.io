<H1>Hardware Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 142 -->
<P>
This chapter describes the enhancements made to OS/2 Version 2.0 in the
area of hardware support.  We begin by focusing on the I/O-related components
of the operating system which are collectively known as the<B> I/O supervisor</B>.
Later in this chapter we investigate IBM and OEM hardware support. The changes
in OS/2 Version 2.0 are specifically targeted to optimize disk device requests
through improvements to the High Performance File System (HPFS) and FAT
file system drivers, and to make use of the capabilities of the new SCSI
adapters and disks. <A HREF="026_L2_OS2Version20IORelate.html">Figure "OS/2
Version 2.0 I/O Related Components"</A> provides an overview of the I/O
related components of OS/2 Version 2.0.

to submit a list of I/O operations to the device driver rather than submitting
them one at a time<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

data to and from buffers for which pages are physically discontiguous in
real storage<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

processing and I/O request completion<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The remainder of this chapter will discuss device driver and file system
changes made under OS/2 Version 2.0, and IBM and OEM hardware support.
