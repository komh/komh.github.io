<H1>Memory Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 121 -->
<P>
The OS/2 Version 2.0 installation procedure examines the hardware of the
machine to determine the amount of installed memory.  Since the recommended
minimum memory configuration is 4MB, the installation procedure will indicate
an error if less than this amount of memory is present at installation time.

<P>
Although 4MB is the minimum memory to start OS/2 V2.0, better performance
will be achieved with 6MB or more.  This is especially true if the workplace
scenario involves running many large or complex applications, or multiple
DOS or Windows applications.  Some examples of typical user scenarios can
be found in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation Manager and Workplace
Shell</I>.
