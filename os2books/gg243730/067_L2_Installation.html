<P>
The installation process for OS/2 Version 2.0 has been enhanced over that
provided for previous versions of OS/2.  After partitioning the fixed disk
(if required) and loading the base operating system, the remainder of the
installation is carried out using a graphical installation procedure based
on Presentation Manager, with full mouse and keyboard support.  Indicators
are provided to allow the user to determine the progress of the installation.

<P>
Installation of optional features is carried out by selecting the required
options from a graphical menu displayed by the installation procedure. Default
system settings such as display type, mouse type, etc. are set by interrogating
the hardware; these defaults may be modified by the user during installation.

<P>
Many parameters such as disk cache size, maximum number of threads and so
on, may be set from within the installation procedure.  These parameters
are set using a dialog box which is displayed when the user selects the
<I>Software Configuration</I> option from the<I> OS/2 Setup and Installation
</I>panel.
<P>
The installation procedure for OS/2 Version 2.0 is described in detail in
<A HREF="110_L1_InstallationConsider.html">Installation Considerations</A>.

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 may also be installed over a local area network (LAN) from
a server machine.  When installing in this manner, optional features may
be specified either by the user or in a response file tailored by a network
administrator.  The process of installation over a LAN is described in<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 Remote Installation and Maintenance</I>.
