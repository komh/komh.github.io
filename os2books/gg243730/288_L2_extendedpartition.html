extended partition
<P>
In the context of Boot Manager, a fixed disk partition which contains one
or more logical drives, and on which certain operating systems such as OS/2
Version 2.0 may be installed.  An extended partition and its logical drives
are visible to the operating system at all times, regardless of which primary
partition is currently active.  Hence extended partitions are useful for
the storage of programs and data which must be shared between multiple operating
systems in an OS/2 Version 2.0 Boot Manager environment.
