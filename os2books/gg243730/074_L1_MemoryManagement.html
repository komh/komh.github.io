OS/2 Version 2.0 is based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor architecture,
and exploits the 32-bit features of the 80386 processor.  The features used
by OS/2 Version 2.0 are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->32-bit register set<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->32-bit instructions/addressing<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Large memory objects (greater than 64KB)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Paging.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

Version 2.0 introduces a flat memory model with a linear address space of
4 gigabytes (GB), and removes many of the memory management restrictions
experienced in previous versions of OS/2.  The purpose of this chapter is
to provide the reader with an understanding of the way that OS/2 Version
2.0 manages memory and the impact of this on system administrators and application
developers.
