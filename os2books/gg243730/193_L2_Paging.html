In addition to the segmented memory management offered on the earlier 80286
processors, the 80386 provides a paged memory model. This is an optional
function of the 80386, and there are no direct performance implications
of an operating system choosing not to use paged memory.  However, the paged
memory model provides significant performance benefits when running large
applications which make extensive use of virtual memory.
<P>
Under previous versions of OS/2, the smallest unit of memory (for memory
management purposes) was the segment, since the operating system was designed
to execute on the 80286 processor and use the segmented memory model.  With
the 80286, segments may vary in size between 16 bytes and 64KB; there is
therefore a danger of having a large amount of free memory which is fragmented
into small, discontiguous units.
<P>
Previous versions of OS/2 managed this by moving segments within real storage
to create a larger free space, and by swapping unused segments to disk until
they are required.  This entailed a high degree of overhead for the operating
system.  With an 80386 processor, however, segments may be up to 4GB in
size, and the overhead could potentially result in an unacceptable performance
impact, particularly for applications with very large segments.  Also there
is the problem of having sufficient physical memory to load a complete segment,
when the segment is very large.
<P>
In order to avoid this situation, the 80386 processor provides a paged memory
model, implemented in hardware through a dedicated paging unit included
on the processor chip. A page is a 4KB unit of contiguous memory, and replaces
the segment as the unit of granularity for memory management, including
swapping to and from disk.  Note that paging is available in protected mode,
in conjunction with both the segmented and flat memory models.
<P>
Using the paged memory model, an application makes a memory reference in
the normal way, using either the segmented memory model or the flat memory
model.  The segmentation unit in the processor automatically resolves the
reference into a 32-bit linear address.  However, this linear address does
not represent a physical address, but is made up as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The high-order 10 bits of the field are used as an
index into a page directory table.  The entry in this table in turn refers
to the base address of a page table.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The next 10 bits of the field are used as an index
into the page table referred to by the page directory entry.  The entry
in the page table provides the physical base address of a 4KB page.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The lower-order 12 bits of the field are used as an
offset within the page referred to by the page table entry.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 maintains a single page directory for the entire system,
but a separate set of page directory entries for each process present in
the system. The physical address of the page directory is held in the CR3
control register.  This is known as the page directory base register (PDBR)
in OS/2 Version 2.0.  When a task switch takes place, the page directory
entries, for the process being scheduled, are copied into the page directory.

<P>
Both the page directory and page tables contain 32-bit page specifiers.
 The page directory and page tables are themselves contained within single
pages, and may therefore contain a maximum of 1024 entries.  Each page directory
can hence access up to 4GB of storage, which is the maximum physical address
space of the 80386.
<P>
Pages may be shared between processes by defining them in the page tables
of more<!-- entering slot 215 --> than one process.  Note that this is done
at the page table level rather than the page directory level, in order to
share<I> only</I> the individual pages required.
<P>
In order to further reduce the overhead involved in looking up page references,
the 80386 also provides a hardware-based address caching mechanism for paging
information.  This is known as the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).  The
TLB contains the physical addresses for the 32 most recently used pages,
and therefore allows very fast access to these pages since it is no longer
necessary to read entries from the page directory and a page table, which
are held in system memory. Use of the TLB is handled entirely within the
paging unit, and is not visible to software.  The operating system must,
however, ensure that the buffer is flushed whenever the PDBR is updated
or an entry in either the page directory or a page table is changed.  This
ensures that the TLB contents are kept in step with the operating system
maintained tables.
