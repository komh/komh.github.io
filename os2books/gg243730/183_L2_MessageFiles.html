<P>
Previous versions of OS/2 supported only a single codepage for message files
used by the system and by applications within the system.  This created
a problem where a process used a codepage other than the system's primary
codepage, since messages appeared using the primary codepage rather than
the codepage specific to that process.  OS/2 Version 2.0 resolves this problem
by allowing multiple codepages in a single message file, and allowing a
message to be retrieved by a process using the codepage currently used by
that process.  This level of support has resulted in changes in the following
areas:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The message file structure is modified to include
codepage and language identification.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The MKMSGF utility is enhanced to create multiple
codepage message files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The MSGBIND utility is enhanced to allow the binding
of messages for multiple codepages to a single application program.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> DosGetMessage()</B> function call in MSG.DLL
is enhanced to retrieve messages based on the current codepage of a process.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A new<B> DosQueryMessageCp()</B> function is added
to MSG.DLL to retrieve the list of codepage and language identifiers present
in the application's message file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Using this support, an application may query the current codepage for its
parent process using the<B> DosQueryCp()</B> function, ensure that codepage
is supported by the application's message file by issuing a<B> DosQueryMessageCp()
</B>call, and then issue<B> DosGetMessage()</B> calls specifying the appropriate
codepage for the message to be retrieved.  For most applications, it is
recommended that the multinational codepage 850 be used where support for
multiple national languages is required.
