<P>
As with software, there are different releases of the Intel 80386 and 80486
family processors. The different releases of the processors are known as
stepping levels. Later stepping levels fix bugs that were found in earlier
stepping levels of the processor. OS/2 V2.0 will take into account the different
stepping levels of processors and handle any nuances. An example would be
when OS/2 V2.0 is running on an 80386 at B1 stepping level, with a numeric
coprocessor present; OS/2 V2.0 will disable the coprocessor and provide
emulation for the coprocessor, as it would do if the coprocessor were not
present. This is one of the ways in which OS/2 V2.0 will circumvent the
known bugs in a 80386 at B1 stepping level.  Bugs such as these were fixed
in the 80386SX and 80486 processors.  In the case of the 80386 processor,
a stepping level of D0 or higher is preferred.
<P>
Some early IBM PS/2s might have B1 stepping level 80386 processors on their
system boards and might qualify for a free engineering change (EC) to upgrade
the system board. If you experience problems running OS/2 on an older system,
contact your dealer or the IBM service organization in your country to have
your system unit checked.
