<H1>AIX Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 188 -->
<P>
It is possible to install AIX, OS/2 and DOS in different partitions on the
same disk and use Boot Manager to switch between the different operating
systems.  There are some things, however, to be aware of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->When AIX installs it creates two partitions on
the disk.  The first partition which is 1MB in size contains the MBR for
AIX.  The second partition contains several AIX minidisks.  The AIX partitions
cannot be created using either the DOS or OS/2 FDISK programs, but are created
by the AIX install process.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The order that AIX, OS/2 or DOS are installed
is not important.  If installing AIX first, remember to leave sufficient
free space available in which to create partitions for OS/2 or DOS. If installing
OS/2 or DOS first, when running FDISK, do not create partitions across the
entire disk.  Also only allocate the Boot Manager partition and one other,
thus leaving two available for AIX.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The OS/2 V2.0 FDISK and FDISKPM programs will
recognize the AIX partitions.  Use FDISK or FDISKPM to make the smaller
AIX partition bootable.  If AIX is installed second, it will be necessary
to shutdown AIX and to boot from the OS/2 install diskettes, escape out
of the install process and run FDISK from the full-screen command prompt
to make Boot Manager<I> startable</I> and the smaller AIX partition<I> bootable</I>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->It is possible to install AIX on the second disk
of a two-disk system.  However AIX will still create a partition with its
MBR on the first disk.  This partition should be marked startable.  On the
second disk it also creates a partition to contain the MBR as well as the
partition for the AIX minidisks.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
