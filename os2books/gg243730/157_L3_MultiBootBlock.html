<H1>Multi-Boot Block</H1><!-- entering slot 174 -->
<P>
The Boot Manager architecture distinguishes between<I> system-independent
</I>and<I> system-dependent</I> components as part of the startup process
of an operating system. The system-independent components are used to connect
the POST code sequence executed on a PS/2 or compatible machine to a system
selection sequence supplied as part of Boot Manager, which then chains to
the operating system-dependent initialization sequence.  The system-independent
components are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The <A HREF="318_L2_MBR.html"><B>Master Boot Record
</B>(<B>MBR</B>)</A> located in the first sector of the physical disk drive.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A <A HREF="317_L2_MBB.html"><B>Multi-Boot Block</B> (<B>MBB</B>)
</A>which resides in a primary partition on the physical drive, outside
of the logical disks accessible by operating systems.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When Boot Manager is enabled as a<I> startable primary partition</I>, the
MBR boots it first, like traditional MBR environments.  The MBB manages
the remainder of the boot process.
<P>
The layers of system independent and system dependent code on the physical
disk drive are shown in <A HREF="027_L2_HardDiskLayout.html">Figure "Hard
Disk Layout"</A>.
<P>
The MBB is installed in a 1MB primary partition which must be created at
the request of the user, by installing Boot Manager. This space is allocated
on request by OS/2 Version 2.0's FDISK/FDISKPM utilities and can be created
at any location on the disk after track zero.  It uses one of the four available
primary partitions on the first physical disk.
<P>
The MBB contains code that:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Displays the logical drive selection menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Allows the user to select the logical drive from which

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Gives control to the boot record of the selected logical
drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Manages a timer tracking the time available for logical
drive selection before using a default logical drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Contains a data area for the names of the designated
default, fallback, and selectable logical drives, the time-out value for
the selection menu and some reserved data space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Contains a data area reserved for boot error messages.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Contains a data area describing locations and status
of logical drives by boot name.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The operating system dependent code resides within the logical drives assigned
to each operating system.  Upon selection of a specific system to be started,
this system specific code is executed, loading the chosen operating system.

<P>
The logical drives are allocated using the FDISK/FDISKPM utilities provided
with OS/2 Version 2.0.  These tools update the MBR to indicate which areas
on the physical disk have been defined as logical drives containing the
operating systems. Boot Manager logical drives can be defined on any ST-506,
ESDI or SCSI interface fixed disk drive which is accessed through INT 13h.
 This precludes logical drives from being created on SCSI devices which
are accessed through INT 4Bh; for example, logical drives may not be created
on removable media devices.
<P>
Once one or more physical drives are set up and logical drives created,
the specific operating system's formatting utility is used to supply the
operating system boot record within the logical drive.  It is important
to note that the OS/2 Dual Boot function operates with the system-dependent
boot code.  Boot Manager neither enhances nor disables the Dual Boot function,
since Boot Manager does not affect the contents of any logical drive. Therefore,
Dual Boot will work in conjunction with and independent of Boot Manager.

<P>
No operating system may store its own information in the MBB or MBR.  Any
such information<I> must</I> be held within the logical disks owned by that
operating system.  Operating systems which do not obey this rule will not
function correctly in the Boot Manager environment nor in any other "multi-boot"
environment, and may compromise disk integrity.  Operating systems which
are known to obey this rule, and operate correctly in the Boot Manager environment,
