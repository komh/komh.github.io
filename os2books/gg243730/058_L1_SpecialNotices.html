formal IBM test and is distributed AS IS. The information about non-IBM
("vendor") products in this manual has been supplied by the vendor and IBM
assumes no responsibility for its accuracy completeness. The use of this
information or the implementation of any of these techniques is a customer
responsibility and depends on the customer's ability to evaluate and integrate
them into the customer's operational environment.  While each item may have
been reviewed by IBM for accuracy in a specific situation, there is no guarantee
that the same or similar results will be obtained elsewhere.  Customers
attempting to adapt these techniques to their own environments do so at
their own risk.
