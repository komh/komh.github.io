page fault exception
<P>
Operating system error which occurs when an application attempts to access
memory which has been allocated but not committed.  This exception may be
trapped by an application using an exception handler registered with the
operating system.  If an exception handler is not registered, the operating
system's default handler will terminate the application as a result of a
page fault exception.  Also known as a Trap 000E.
