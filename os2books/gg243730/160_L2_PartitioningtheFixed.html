<H1>Partitioning the Fixed Disk</H1><!-- entering slot 178 -->
<P>
Boot Manager can be installed, the machine's fixed disks partitioned, and
logical disks created at the beginning of OS/2 Version 2.0 installation.
 It is possible to install Boot Manager after the operating system has been
installed by use of OS/2 V2.0's full-screen FDISK command.  See <A HREF="161_L3_BootManagerInstallat.html">Boot
Manager Installation</A> for further information.
<P>
The names of the logical drives presented at the Boot Manager startup menu
are stored in the MBB for primary partitions and in the<B> Extended Boot
Record</B> (<B>EBR</B>) for logical drives in extended partitions.  For
SCSI drives that may be moved freely between different workstations, this
approach allows Boot Manager to identify that drive continuously via the
same logical name, even though the internal drive letter assignment may
have changed.
<P>
Operating systems such as OS/2 and DOS are installed on the logical drives,
and the user may then switch back and forth between operating systems via
the selection menu displayed at IPL time.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides two programs to create and maintain partitions
on fixed disks.  These programs provide substantially similar function and
differ primarily in their presentation support requirements:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>FDISK</B> operates in character mode in a full-screen
session, and supports command line parameters and options, but does not
support pointer device (mouse) input.  FDISK is provided for use during
the initial installation of OS/2 Version 2.0, before the Presentation Manager
components are loaded, and for occasions when it is not possible to load
Presentation Manager or a command line parameter-driven interface is required.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>FDISKPM</B> operates on the Presentation Manager
desktop and supports pointer devices, but does not support command line
parameters and options.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The normal expectation is that FDISKPM will be utilized for partition maintenance,
unless there is some reason that Presentation Manager cannot be loaded.

<P>
An FDISK utility was supplied with OS/2 Version 1.3. However, its only function
was to completely erase any existing partition information and as such it
was only intended for use by the installation process, had no meaningful
user interface and was not documented.  The primary difference between FDISKPM
supplied with OS/2 Version 1.3 and the FDISK/FDISKPM supplied with OS/2
Version 2.0 is the addition of a facility for the creation and management
of multiple primary partitions together with additional facilities for management
of logical drives, as well as support for managing multiple operating systems
installed on the logical drives.
