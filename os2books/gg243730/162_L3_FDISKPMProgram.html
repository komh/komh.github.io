<H1>FDISKPM Program</H1><!-- entering slot 180 -->
<P>
The following description applies to the FDISKPM program.  The facilities
provided by the full-screen interface of the FDISK program are generally
the same, though they are accessed slightly differently.  Since there are
such strong similarities between FDISK and FDISKPM, only the FDISKPM program
will be described in this section.  The command line interface for FDISK
is described in <A HREF="163_L3_FDISKProgram.html">FDISK Program</A>.
<P>
FDISKPM is used to create or delete logical drives in primary or extended
partitions on a fixed disk.  With FDISKPM, a user can use Boot Manager to
set up fixed disks on the system. The FDISKPM interface is shown in <A HREF="028_L2_FDISKPMShowingDiskOn.html">Figure
"FDISKPM Showing Disk One (of a Two Disk System)"</A> and <A HREF="029_L2_FDISKPMShowingDiskTw.html">Figure
"FDISKPM Showing Disk Two (of a Two Disk System)"</A>.
<P>
The FDISKPM window has five columns containing specific information about
the partitions that exist on the hard disks in the system.  Each hard disk
is represented by an icon at the top of the FDISKPM window.  When a hard
disk is selected, its partition information is displayed in the window.
 Partitions are either primary partitions or logical drives within an extended
partition.  Any free space (space within the hard disk that is available
for more partitions) is also displayed in the window.
<P>
This information includes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Name</B>: Displays the name that has been assigned
to any primary partition or logical drive to be displayed on the Boot Manager
menu.  This name is specified using the<I> Add to Boot Manager</I> menu
choice and can be changed by using the Change Partition Name choice.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Status</B>: Shows the partition status, which may
be one of the following.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><B>Installable</B>: the partition is used as the target
for installing another operating system.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><B>Bootable</B>: the partition is displayed on the
Boot Manager menu when the system is restarted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><B>Startable</B>: the system will restarts directly
to this partition.  This option is available for primary partitions only.
 Remember, one of the primary partitions must be set as startable for the
system to restart successfully.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Access</B>:
specifies if a partition is accessible.  The letter in the column indicates
that the partition is accessible.  This column also indicates if the partition
is a primary partition or a logical drive within the extended partition.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>File System Type</B>:
indicates the type of file system on the partition.  Any partitions that
have not been formatted will be displayed as unformatted.  Any area on the
hard disk not assigned to a partition will be displayed as free space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>MBytes</B>:
indicates the size in megabytes of the partition or free space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The user may select choices on the options pull-down to:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Install the Boot Manager partition.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Create

</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Assign the accessibility of primary partitions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Specify startup values such as a default partition,
startup selection time, or mode for the Boot Manager menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Remove a partition from the Boot Manager menu.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Delete a primary partition or logical drive.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Set a primary partition as installable.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Specify a primary partition as being startable.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Exit FDISKPM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that a hard disk and partition must be selected before these operations
can be performed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Setting a Partition Installable</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The FDISKPM
<I>Set Installable</I> menu option is used to set the selected partition
as the target for continuing the OS/2 installation, or as a target to install
another operating system.  When a partition is set installable, the installable
indicator will be displayed in the Status column.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Creating
and Deleting a Partition</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The FDISKPM<I> Create
</I>menu option is used to create logical drives in primary or extended
partitions on the selected physical drive.  In addition, the user may do
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Create multiple
primary partitions (up to four for each physical drive).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Place
the partitions in relation to the beginning or end of each free area on
the physical drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Assign
extended partition space as each logical drive is created.  This provides
flexibility for later assignment of free space.  For example, if free space
exists between a primary and extended partition, it may subsequently be
allocated to another primary partition or for expanding the extended partition.
<!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL>
<P>
The FDISKPM<I> Delete</I> menu option is used to delete primary or extended
partitions on the selected physical drive.
<P>
<B>Warning: </B> All data in such a partition is lost after<B> saving changes
</B>on exiting FDISK.<!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Making a partition Bootable</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The
<I>Add to Boot Manager menu</I>  option is used to name the partition and
add it to the Boot Manager menu at startup. When<I> Bootable</I> appears
in the<I> Status</I> column, the partition will be displayed. To<!-- entering slot 181 --> remove
the partition so that it is not displayed on the Boot Manager menu, select
<I>Remove from Boot Manager menu</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Assign
Primary Partition</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The<I> Assign x: partition
</I>option is used to specify the accessibility of primary partitions.  Because
only one primary partition for each hard disk can be active (accessible)
at a time, other primary partitions are effectively hidden (inaccessible).
 This feature exists for primary partitions only.  All logical drives are
accessible.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Making a partition Startable</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Use
<I>Make startable</I> to make a primary partition that you have highlighted
on the FDISKPM window the one that will be activated each time you start
the system.  To have Boot Manager support active and have the Boot Manager
menu displayed when the system is started, the Boot Manager partition must
be set as startable. To deactivate Boot Manager support so that the Boot
Manager menu is not displayed, set another primary partition as startable,
that is, the partition that you want started when the system is turned on.
 Only one primary partition is startable at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Partition
Names</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Partition names are important especially
in the event of a hardware reconfiguration such as adding other physical
disks to the system.  The names assigned to partitions will not change and
still identify the same area on the disk, unlike the drive letters which
can change if your system is reconfigured.  Names are up to eight characters
in length and are case sensitive. Use the<I> Change partition name</I> to
rename any bootable partitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Setting Startup
Values</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The FDISKPM<I> Set startup values</I> is
used to specify the startup values for the partitions on the system.  The
values are for the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>A
default partition to be started automatically without being selected from
the Boot Manager menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>A
startup selection time allowing you to specify the amount of time you want
the menu to be displayed before the default partition is started automatically.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>A mode for the menu allowing
you to indicate how much information about the partitions you want displayed
on it.<!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
