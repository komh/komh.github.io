<H1>UNDELETE Command</H1><!-- entering slot 155 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a facility to delay the permanent removal of files
that have been deleted.  By default, files that are deleted or erased are
stored (as hidden system files) in the \DELETE subdirectory.  The UNDELETE
command gives the user the ability to recover such deleted files and restore
them to their original path.
<P>
A new environment variable DELDIR is provided to specify the path used to
store deleted files.  A separate directory and maximum directory size must
be specified for each logical disk.  The absence of a DELDIR environment
variable in the CONFIG.SYS or a DELDIR statement with no path specified
will disable the facility.
<P>
The function<I> DosForceDelete()</I> has been added to allow files to be
deleted permanently without first making them recoverable.
