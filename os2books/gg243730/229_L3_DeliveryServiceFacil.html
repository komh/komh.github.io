<H1>Delivery Service Facilities</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
The SCB architecture defines two forms of control block delivery, known
as<B> locate mode</B> and<B> move mode</B>. As the IBM SCSI adapters use
locate mode delivery only this mode will be described. The following section
provide an overview of the services, functions and protocols defined for
locate mode and a brief description of their underlying control structures.

<P>
<B>Locate Mode</B>
<P>
Locate mode is generally used for traditional I/O protocols where there
is a single system unit that requests a feature adapter to perform work
on its behalf. The format of the control structure in locate mode is relatively
fixed. The structure allows various command, status, and indirect list control
blocks, connected with pointers, to represent a request from a client to
a server. <A HREF="047_L2_OverviewofDeliverySu.html">Figure "Overview of
Delivery Support"</A> shows an overview of the control block and data delivery
support.
<P>
The delivery support delivers one request at a time. A control block request
is initiated by the client, which passes the physical address of the control
block to the server through a command register (port) in I/O. The I/O space
ports are described in <A HREF="227_L3_IOPortDefinitions.html">I/O Port
Definitions</A>.
<P>
Locate mode provides:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Requests to Devices</B>
<P>
To use a device, a client sends requests in the form of control blocks to
the device ID that represents the device and receives replies from it for
each such request.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Support for Multiple Devices per Adapter</B>
<P>
Adapters may provide support for multiple devices. For example, multiple
I/O devices may be connected to a single SCSI adapter. The delivery support
enables the delivery of requests to specific devices through the use of
unique device identification numbers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Adapter Management</B>
<P>
To be able to manage the adapter and deliver device/resource control information
to it, the adapter's unit manager is assigned device ID 0. It receives all
adapter unit management information.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Command and Data Chaining and Detailed Status</B>
<P>
The control structure defined for locate mode provides for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Immediate command type requests<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Requests that contain one command control and status
block<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Requests made up of multiple chained command control
blocks.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> Command blocks may point to data directly
or via an indirect address list. <A HREF="048_L2_LocateModeControlBlo.html">Figure
"Locate Mode Control Block Delivery Structure"</A> shows a sample request
control structure consisting of two command control blocks (command chaining).
The first control block uses an indirect list control block to reference
multiple buffers (data chaining). The second control block has a direct
pointer to a single buffer. The pointer to the first control block is communicated
via the shared I/O address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Use
of DMA</B>
<P>
In locate mode, both the control block structure for a request and the data
associated with the request are transferred between the system unit and
the adapter using DMA. This DMA operation is managed by the adapter's delivery
support. The IBM SCSI adapters have a DMA with a 32-bit addressing capability,
hence they are not limited by the fact that the DMA in the IBM PS/2 system
units currently only supports 24-bit addressing.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Interrupts
</B>
<P>
The delivery service allows the client to define when and under what conditions
interrupts should be generated. Generally, a single interrupt is generated
for each completed request. When a request contains a chain of control blocks,
additional interrupts may be requested for synchronization at intermediate
points within the request.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are<!-- entering slot 254 --> three different control block structures
used by locate mode requests:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Command Control Blocks</B>
<P>
The base command control block is a variable length structure created and
maintained in shared memory by the client in the system unit. It is used
to convey requests to a subsystem or device in an adapter. These requests
are used to direct the operation of the subsystem or device. In <A HREF="049_L2_SCBStructureUsedbyth.html">Figure
"SCB Structure Used by the IBM SCSI Adapter"</A> we show the structure of
the command control block as used by the IBM SCSI adapters.
<P>
The<B> command word</B> specifies the operation to be executed, for example
read or write.  The<B> enable word</B> controls optional features to be
used during the operation, for example whether the system buffer address
points to actual data or is an indirect reference.
<P>
The OS/2 V2.0 disk device driver builds the SCB and other control blocks
required. It then calls the ABIOS transfer SCB function to initiate the
operation. ABIOS uses the adapter's I/O ports to pass the SCB address. The
adapter then uses its DMA controller to read the SCB into private memory
on the adapter where it decodes it and initiates the required operation.
Data is read from or written to system memory using the adapters DMA controller.

<P>
The IBM SCSI adapters support chaining of SCBs.  The adapter then uses the
chain address to find the next SCB in a chain. All SCBs in a chain must
be for the same device.  SCBs are executed in the order that they are chained
in.  The device driver will try to sort the SCBs into an order that will
minimize head movement unless requested not to.  Where the order of execution
is critical (for example, paging might require that certain writes be done
before reads) this optimization will be disabled.
<P>
A single IBM SCSI adapter can overlap processing of one command for up to
15 attached devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Indirect Address Lists</B>
<P>
An indirect address list is a variable length list containing address-count
pairs, and is used to support data chaining. The location of the indirect
list control block and its length are specified by the System Buffer Address
and System Buffer Byte Count fields in the command control block.
<P>
Each entry in the list is 8 bytes (4 byte address and 4 byte length).
<P>
The IBM SCSI adapters use the indirect address list structure for specifying
scatter/gather lists. The layout of a scatter/gather list is shown in <A HREF="050_L2_IBMSCSIAdapterScatte.html">Figure
"IBM SCSI Adapter Scatter/Gather List"</A>. When passing a memory address
to an adapter, the actual physical address at which the data is located
must be used. Because of the mapping of virtual memory to pages in the physical
address space, a data buffer could be split across multiple discontiguous
pages. This means that a single logical disk I/O operation could require
several physical operations. The scatter/gather list allows one I/O operations
to access data in more than one physical memory location. Each entry in
the list specifies a physical memory address and a data length.
<P>
During a write to disk, data is then gathered from different memory locations
and written to a contiguous block on disk. During a read from disk, data
can be scattered to different locations in system memory. The IBM SCSI adapters
support scatter/gather lists with up to 16 entries.
<P>
When coupled with the ability to chain SCBs together, scatter/gather lists
form an efficient mechanism for communicating paging I/O operations. By
being able to chain SCBs together, both reads and writes can be specified
in a single call from the paging subsystem to the<!-- entering slot 255 --> file
system. Scatter/gather lists allow multiple page reads or writes for a single
SCB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Termination Status Control Blocks</B>
<P>
In addition to the status indication in the ISP (Interrupt Status Port),
the SCB architecture allows status information to be reported for each command.
This information can be reported in a termination status block, which is
connected to each command control block. The adapter writes request completion
status or termination status into this control block. The layout of the
termination status block used by the IBM SCSI adapters is shown in <A HREF="051_L2_IBMSCSIAdapterTermin.html">Figure
"IBM SCSI Adapter Termination Status Block"</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
