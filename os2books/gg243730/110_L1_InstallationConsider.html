<P>
The installation of OS/2 Version 2.0 is greatly simplified when compared
to previous versions of OS/2, through the provision of a graphical installation
procedure.  This installation procedure addresses a number of the shortcomings
experienced in previous versions of OS/2:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It provides greater feedback to the user during installation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It provides a more flexible way for users to customize
their system.
<P>
The user is able to add optionally installable features at any time and
to change the system configuration without having to boot from diskette.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It uses the standard OS/2 Presentation Manager user
interface to guide the user through the installation process.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It supports installation from any drive to any drive.

<P>
This feature makes it possible to install OS/2 V2.0 from a drive on a LAN
server, CD-ROM or any other media which can be accessed as a "normal" drive
letter. The process of installation over a LAN is described in<I> OS/2 Version
2.0 Remote Installation and Maintenance</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The installation procedure provided in Version 2.0 will in most cases be
able to sense the hardware configuration of the system on which it is being
installed, and will select the required device drivers. This awareness applies
to the video and disk subsystems, keyboard and pointing devices. The user
will be given the option to change or add to the configuration determined
by the installation procedure.
