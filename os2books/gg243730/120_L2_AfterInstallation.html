When OS/2 V2.0  is first started after installation, startup time will be
longer than normal. However OS/2 V2.0 will load the tutorial so that the
user has the option to view the <A HREF="024_L2_OS2Version20Tutorial.html">OS/2
Version 2.0 Tutorial</A> while the operating system is initializing itself.
 This tutorial provides a basic introduction to OS/2 Version 2.0 and the
graphical user interface, including use of the mouse and keyboard to interact
with Presentation Manager.
<P>
The tutorial provides very simple instructions to allow the user to navigate
through the tutorial panels.  Using the tutorial teaches the user about
the various capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0, while at the same time allowing
the user to become familiar with the ways of interacting with a typical
OS/2 Presentation Manager application.
