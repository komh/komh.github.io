<H1>Windows Application Support</H1><!-- entering slot 74 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability for Windows applications to run
under OS/2 Version 2.0 using its WIN-OS/2* component. This support allows
applications written for Windows 3.0 and previous versions of Windows to
coexist and execute in the same machine.
<P>
Each Windows application executes as a protected mode process.  Windows
applications are, therefore, subject to the full application protection
facilities provided to protected mode applications under OS/2 Version 2.0,
and are protected from one another and from DOS or OS/2 applications executing
in the system. This protection is in contrast to the native Windows 3.0
environment, where protection is limited to Windows 3.0 applications only,
provided these applications use Windows' memory management services.  Protection
for DOS applications is provided only when Windows is running in 386 enhanced
mode.
<P>
The execution of Windows applications as protected mode tasks also allows
these applications to take full advantage of the pre-emptive multitasking
capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0, with full pre-emptive multitasking between
Windows applications, DOS applications, and OS/2 applications. This protection
is again in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment, where pre-emptive
multitasking is available only when Windows 3.0 is running in 386 enhanced
mode, and only for DOS applications, thereby impacting performance and preventing
many applications written for previous versions of Windows from executing.
 OS/2 Version 2.0 has no such restriction.
<P>
Support for Windows applications under OS/2 Version 2.0 is discussed in
more detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I>.
