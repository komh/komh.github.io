<P>
The I/O supervisor components of OS/2 Version 2.0 are designed to make greater
use of advanced I/O devices than previous versions of OS/2.  Particular
emphasis has been given to the optimization of disk access through the use
of the High Performance File System and SCSI devices.
<P>
New to OS/2 V2.0 is the Layered Device Driver architecture which enables
the device drivers to be developed more easily to support OEM hardware.
This interface expedites the development of new DASD and SCSI device support
by OEM's by reducing device driver code and complexity. This architecture
allows OS/2 to better support a broad range of OEM platforms and devices.

<P>
Device drivers are provided with new device help commands to enable drivers
to more efficiently use the 32-bit flat memory model and the paging facility
for virtual memory management.
<P>
A new disk device driver has been defined for use by the High Performance
File System, which optimizes access to SCSI devices by allowing request
prioritization and making use of the command chaining capabilities of the
SCSI adapters. This optimization allows more efficient use of the physical
devices.  For paging operations where the sequence of read and write operations
may be critical, the device driver allows the request optimization to be
disabled.
