<H1>New Disk Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>
A new disk device driver interface has been defined for use by OS/2 V2.0
file systems. The request-passing mechanism employs a request list of prioritized
commands which the device driver may reorder to optimize access.  Read and
write operations use scatter/gather descriptors (as used by SCSI adapters)
allowing data transfer to and from discontiguous memory buffers.  The interface
is designed to be data-structure compatible with future versions of OS/2
in order to minimize work at the time of migration.
<P>
With this extended device driver support, both the standard OS/2 interface
(using ABIOS read/write) and the new high performance interface (using the
ABIOS Transfer SCB) allow both OS/2 file systems and the OS/2 kernel to
access the disk.
<P>
The following is a summary of the device driver changes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The disk device driver records the information indicating
the type of DASD (ESDI/ST506 or SCSI) and the level of caching support for
each logical drive (LID)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Support is provided for the new device command<B> 1Dh
- GetDeviceSupport</B>.  The device driver will return addresses to two
structures in the request packet:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->The<I> Driver Capabilities Structure (DCS)</I> indicates
the specific features that are supported by the device driver
<P>
Examples are disk mirroring, disk duplexing and whether the device supports
more than 16MB of memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->The<I> Volume Characteristics Structure (VCS)
</I>for the device identified by the unit code in the device command
<P>
Examples of characteristics reported in this structure are read-only, removable
media, average seek time, outboard caching supported, SCB protocol supported
and read prefetch supported.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>Support

</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>I/O
requests are placed on the device queue based on a priority passed in the
request list
<P>
To optimize the I/O operation, all requests are sorted in logical block
number sequence.  If a specific flag is on in the request list indicating
that the execution order is critical, then the list will not be sorted.

<P>
The possible priorities are:<B><I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
Priority<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Meaning</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><B> 00h

<UL>Prefetch requests<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<UL>Urgent request - used by kernel in critical
situations.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Calling
threads with<B> ExecuteChain()</B> requests are no longer blocked by the
device driver strategy routine
<P>
The strategy routine instead returns control to the caller after the I/O
is initiated or queued.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Upon
I/O completion, the device driver calls the notification routine specified
in the request list.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
