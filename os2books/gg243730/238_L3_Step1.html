<P>
You will notice that the operating system always allocates at least 4KB
(1 page) of memory, even although only 1 byte may be specified in the allocation
request.  This is because all memory management in OS/2 Version 2.0 is handled
on a per-page basis, using the flat memory model.  The page is the lowest
level of granularity in OS/2 Version 2.0; this differs from previous versions
of OS/2, which had a byte-level granularity.
<P>
This principle applies to<I> all</I> memory protection and memory access
types (read, write, etc.).  This allows a programmer to use more memory
for read/write than is actually requested in an allocation request as shown
in step 1, provided that memory is within the physical page boundary.
