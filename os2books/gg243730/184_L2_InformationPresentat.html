<A HREF="055_L2_IPFNLSLanguageFiles.html">Table "IPF NLS Language Files"
</A>shows the language files used by the Information Presentation Facility
(IPF), in order to provide national language support.
<P>
These files are installed as part of the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for
OS/2 2.0</I>, and are used during execution of the IPF compiler.  The compiler
requires a symbol file APSYMBOL.APS to be available.  When using DBCS languages,
the default symbol file must be overwritten with a symbol file appropriate
for the language being used.  See<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Information Presentation
Reference</I> for details.
