<H1>Creating Threads</H1><!-- entering slot 108 -->
<P>
The preparation and dispatching of secondary threads within applications
is greatly simplified under OS/2 Version 2.0.  Under previous versions of
OS/2, the application was required to explicitly allocate and deallocate
memory for the stack segment of a secondary thread.  Version 2.0 allows
the operating system to perform the allocation of the stack memory object
on the application's behalf as part of the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function,
and to free the stack segment when the thread terminates.  The application
need only specify the required size of the segment in the<B> DosCreateThread()
</B>call.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 uses the guard page technique described in <A HREF="074_L1_MemoryManagement.html">Memory
Management</A> to progressively commit each thread's stack during execution,
up to the maximum size specified in the<B> DosCreateThread()</B> function.
 This minimizes the real storage requirement of the stack, makes the most
efficient use of available real storage, and thereby improves overall system
performance.
