<H1>Intel 80386 32-Bit Microprocessor Support</H1><!-- entering slot 64 -->
<P>
The basis for OS/2 Version 2.0 is its support for the Intel 80386 microprocessor.
This support means that a powerful set of 32-bit features now becomes available
to the operating system and applications, including enhanced memory management
and more sophisticated multitasking.  The Intel 80386 and 80486** offer
significant improvements over the previous generation of 16-bit microprocessors,
while retaining compatibility with these processors.
<P>
The Intel 80386 architecture incorporates the following on-chip features,
which enhance the throughput and performance of the system:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Multitasking support<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Memory management<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Instruction pipelining<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Address translation cache<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->High-speed bus interface.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Along with these features also comes the greater addressing capacity of
the Intel 80386:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>gigabyte (GB) physical address space, with up
to 512 megabytes (MB) per process under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> This figure applies to the 80386DX processor and all 80486
processors; the 80386SX, 80386SL and 80386SLC may only address up to 16MB
of physical memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>byte to 4 gigabyte memory objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 uses many of these processor features and capabilities
to provide a more powerful and flexible operating system platform.  Note
that OS/2 Version 2.0 does not implement the full 64 terabyte virtual address
space provided by the 80386, since this requires use of the segmented memory
model; OS/2 Version 2.0 uses a flat memory model which is described below.
