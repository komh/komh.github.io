<P>
For optional installable features, the user is prompted to indicate which
options are required.  The name of each option is displayed, along with
the amount of fixed disk space required by that option.  Selections are
made using check boxes, as shown in <A HREF="021_L2_SelectingFeaturestoI.html">Figure
"Selecting Features to Install"</A>.
<P>
In certain cases, additional information may be specified to install a particular
option; for example, the<I> Tools and Games</I> option represents a group
of individually installable applications, of which the user may elect to
install any or all.  The presence of additional information is indicated
using<I> More...</I> pushbuttons adjacent to each such option.  Selecting
one of these pushbuttons displays a dialog box which allows the user to
configure the option.
<P>
When the user has selected all the required options to be installed, the
installation is commenced by selecting the<I> OK</I> pushbutton on the dialog
box.
