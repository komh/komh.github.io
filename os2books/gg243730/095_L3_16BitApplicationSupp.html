<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 supports the execution of 16-bit applications directly,
with no modification required.  These applications execute as protected
mode processes under operating system control, exactly as they did under
previous versions of OS/2.  Full memory protection and interprocess communication
facilities are available to such applications.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also allows both 16-bit and 32-bit modules and resources
to reside and execute within the same process.  Address conversion and translation
is accomplished using tiled local descriptor tables and thunks.  These concepts
are fully described in <A HREF="087_L2_16BitApplicationsina.html">16-Bit
Applications in a 32-Bit Environment</A>.
