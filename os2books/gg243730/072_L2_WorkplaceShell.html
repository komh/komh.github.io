<H1>Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 75 -->
<P>
The component of the operating system which is responsible for interaction
with the end user is known as the user shell.  OS/2 Version 2.0  provides
an enhanced, object-based user shell known as the <A HREF="373_L2_WorkplaceShell.html"><B>Workplace
Shell</B></A>, which implements the 1991 SAA CUA Workplace Environment.

<P>
In the Workplace Shell, system resources such as files, printers, etc. are
regarded as objects, and represented by graphical icons on the screen. Users
may manipulate objects (open them for editing, copy them, print them, etc.)
by direct manipulation of the icons.  For example, a file is copied from
one location to another by pointing to it with the mouse,<I> dragging</I> the
object's icon to the required destination, and<I> dropping</I> the icon
by releasing the mouse button. This action is known as <A HREF="285_L2_draganddrop.html"><B>drag
and drop</B></A> manipulation.
<P>
The Workplace Shell allows users to become more task-oriented by simplifying
the user interface and reducing the amount of system-specific knowledge
required to perform work tasks.  The performance of these tasks using the
Workplace Shell is more analogous to the way in which such tasks would be
performed manually, thereby requiring less user education on the operation
of the system.
<P>
The Workplace Shell is described in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume
3:  Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell</I>.
