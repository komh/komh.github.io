<H1>Micro Channel Participants</H1><!-- entering slot 233 -->
<P>
There are two basic types of devices, which may exist on and communicate
via the Micro Channel:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<I> master</I> is an intelligent device, which may
contend for control of the channel.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<I> slave</I> is a unintelligent device, which merely
acts as the source or target of a data transfer, in conjunction with a master.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
<A HREF="039_L2_MicroChannelParticip.html">Figure "Micro Channel Participants
and Data Transfer Paths"</A> shows the interaction between masters and slaves
over the Micro Channel. The master devices are of three kinds:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> system master</B> is the processor provided
with the system hardware, and is thus also known as the system processor.
The system master assumes ownership of the channel when no other master
has arbitrated for and won control of it. The system master is, therefore,
also known as the<B> default master</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> <A HREF="281_L2_DMA.html">DMA</A> controller
</B>is typically provided on the system board.  It supports multiple independent
DMA channels, each allowing the attachment of a DMA slave. Each DMA slave
is allocated its own dedicated channel. The DMA controller manages the transfer
of data between a DMA slave and a memory slave, and supports burst mode
data transfer if the DMA slave requests it.  The DMA controller does not
arbitrate for the channel, but requires the DMA slave to do the arbitration.
 Once this is done, the data transfer is completed independently of the
system processor.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> bus master</B> is an intelligent device or
adapter on the Micro Channel and is typically an advanced adapter, which
functions as a subsystem within the system. It arbitrates for the channel
and manages the data transfer to or from an I/O slave or a memory slave.
The bus master is described further in <A HREF="210_L3_BusMasterAdapters.html">Bus
Master Adapters</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Slave devices on the Micro Channel may be of three kinds:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> I/O slave</B> is selected via its address in
the I/O address space. The system processor or a bus master is required
to actually perform the data transfer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> memory slave</B> is selected via its address
in the memory address space. Any master may perform the data transfer. The
memory may reside on the system board or on an adapter on the Micro Channel.
It can also be non-system memory (such as memory-mapped I/O) on an adapter,
used for communication of information between the system and the adapter.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> DMA I/O slave</B> contends for control of the
Micro Channel on behalf of the DMA controller, and is thus an exception
to the normal rule that slaves do not contend for control of the Micro Channel.
It relies on the DMA controller to be the controlling master and manage
the data transfer between the DMA slave and memory slave.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
