<H1>Synchronous Exception Signaling</H1><!-- entering slot 243 -->
<P>
The Micro Channel architecture provides for exception signaling using the
CHCK signal. Initial use of the CHCK signal in the PS/2 line of products
was asynchronous. With the new advanced uses of the Micro Channel and bus
master adapters, which are able to execute multiple I/O-operations in burst
mode, synchronous exception handling is needed in order to correctly associate
an exception with the command that caused it.
<P>
The synchronous exception support within the Micro Channel architecture
provides for activation of the CHCK signal in the same bus cycle that caused
the exception. This simplifies the exception handling and provides increased
system data integrity.
