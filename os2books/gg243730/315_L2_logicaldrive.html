In the context of Boot Manager, a subdivision of a fixed disk partition,
which is regarded by an operating system as a logical entity.  Logical drives
are typically accessed using logical drive letters (for example, "C").  Logical
drives are used to store operating system code, programs and data files.
 A primary partition may only contain a single logical drive, while an extended
partition may contain multiple logical drives.
