Term used in the 80386 segmented memory model, to refer to the case where
two different addresses reference the same physical memory location; the
location is said to be<I> aliased</I>.  This technique is used when sharing
memory between processes, and when mapping memory references between 16:16
and 0:32 addressing schemes.
