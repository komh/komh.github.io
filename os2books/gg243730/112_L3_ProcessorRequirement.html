<H1>Processor Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 120 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 is designed to use the instruction set of the Intel 80386
processor, and therefore requires a system unit equipped with either an
Intel 80386 DX, SX, SL or SLC processor, or subsequent Intel processors
such as the 80486 series, which implement the same processor instruction
set.  IBM machines equipped with such processors include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
<B>Exception: </B> The IBM PS/2 N33 SX Model A13, which was available only
in certain countries, does not support OS/2 V2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 will<I> not</I> run on machines equipped with an Intel
80286 processor. Hence machines such as the IBM PC AT*, PS/2 Model 30-286,
and Models 50, 50Z, and 60 may not be used to run OS/2 Version 2.0. However,
OS/2 V2.0 does support 80286-based machines which have been upgraded with
a 386 or 486 processor using cards such as the AOX MicroMaster** card.
<P>
The use of OS/2 Version 2.0 is not limited to IBM hardware; the operating
system will execute on other manufacturers' machines, provided they are
sufficiently compatible and equipped with an appropriate processor and hardware
configuration.  For information on hardware compatibility with OS/2 Version
2.0, readers should consult their dealer, hardware supplier or IBM marketing
representative.  Information is also available on CompuServe** and IBM bulletin
board systems.  Documentation shipped with OS/2 V2.0 contains details of
gaining access to these systems.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This new 32-bit OS/2 Version 2.0 uses advanced features of
PC systems that were not exploited with the earlier 16-bit operating systems.
 In order to avoid any problems with installing or running OS/2 V2.0, it
is advisable to update the PC system configuration to the latest release
levels.  Depending on the manufacturer of the system, this may involve different
steps from running the system configuration software through to replacing
the BIOS.  Users of IBM PS/2s should obtain<I> the latest</I> version of
their PS/2 reference diskette from IBM.  Running automatic system configuration
with this reference diskette will ensure the system is updated to the new
level. This particularly applies to PS/2s such as the Models 90 and 95 which
load their BIOS from disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
