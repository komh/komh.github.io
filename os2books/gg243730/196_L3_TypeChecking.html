<P>
With each descriptor, there is a<I> type</I> field which is used to distinguish
between the different descriptor formats.  This field also specifies the
intended use of a segment.  For example, the allowable types for data segments
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Read-Only<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Read/Write<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
and for code segments:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Execute-Only<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Execute/Read.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The type field, therefore, ensures that segments are only used in ways for
which they are intended.  For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The code segment (CS) register may only be loaded
with the selector of an executable segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Selectors of executable segments that are not defined
as readable cannot be loaded into a data segment (DS, ES, FS, and GS) registers.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->No instruction may write into an executable segment.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->No instruction may write into a data segment unless
that segment is defined as<I> Read/Write</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->No instruction may read an executable segment unless
that segment is defined as<I> Execute/Read</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
So far this discussion applies to segment level checking. When paging is
enabled, there is also checking done at the page level.  Pages may be of
two types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Read-only access<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Read/write access.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Segment protection is evaluated first, then page protection is checked.
It is possible to have a large segment which is both readable and writable
and to have pages within it which are only readable.  At the page level,
the execute-only attribute does not exist.
