<H1>What is SCSI?</H1><!-- entering slot 245 -->
<P>
SCSI is a standard interface bus, through which computers may communicate
with devices such as fixed disks, CD-ROMs, printers, plotters, scanners,
etc. The standard is fully described in<I> ANSI standard X3.131-1986</I>.

<P>
SCSI is a bus level interface, as compared to interfaces such as ESDI and
ST-506, which are device level interfaces. With a bus level interface all
the circuitry required to control the device is built into the device itself.
This is the reason it is possible to attach different device types to a
SCSI bus.
<P>
Up to eight SCSI devices can be attached to a single SCSI bus. The first
of these devices is normally the SCSI attachment adapter, which would be
installed in the PS/2 system unit and act as a bridge between the system
unit bus (the Micro Channel) and the SCSI bus. A further seven SCSI devices
can then be connected by means of the SCSI bus cable. Each of these physical
devices can support up to eight logical devices. Each device attached to
the SCSI bus has a device ID that is in the range 0 - 7. The attachment
feature is usually given the ID of 7 making it the highest priority device
on the bus. <A HREF="043_L2_SCSISubsystemBlockDi.html">Figure "SCSI Subsystem
Block Diagram"</A> shows this diagrammatically.
<P>
SCSI supports features such as arbitration and disconnect/reconnect allowing
several devices to operate concurrently and to share the bus. Data transfer
across the SCSI can either be asynchronous or synchronous. Asynchronous
data transfer requires that each byte sent across the bus be acknowledged
before the next byte is transferred. When using synchronous mode, each byte
of data must still be acknowledged but multiple bytes may be sent before
any acknowledgements have been received.
<P>
The cable connecting the SCSI devices may be up to 20 feet (6 meters) in
length, and carries 8-bit parallel data with a transfer rate of 5MB per
second.
