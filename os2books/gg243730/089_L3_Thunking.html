<H1>Thunking</H1><!-- entering slot 96 -->
<P>
Address conversion between 16:16 and 0:32 addressing models is achieved
by the use of a <A HREF="361_L2_thunk.html"><B>thunk</B></A>. A thunk exists
for each programming interface in the system.  Thunking implies:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Converting the addressing scheme used (0:32 - 16)
</B>
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 uses a flat linear (0:32) addressing scheme.  16:16 program
modules expect a selector:offset (16:16) addressing scheme.  The thunk converts
memory references between these two schemes.  See <A HREF="014_L2_ThunkConcept.html">Figure
"Thunk Concept"</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Different parameter sizes (DWORD versus WORD)</B>
<P>
The 0:32 addressing scheme uses 32-bit (LONG or DWORD) values as the basic
data type.  The 16:16 scheme uses a 16-bit (SHORT or WORD) value as the
basic data type.  The thunk converts between WORD and DWORD length data.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Structure alignment</B>
<P>
The 16:16 addressing scheme normally causes data structures to be WORD aligned,
whereas the 0:32 addressing scheme defaults to DWORD alignment; blank space
is included within the structure so that each element is aligned on a DWORD
boundary.  The thunk must realign data structures where necessary.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Stack conversion</B>
<P>
The 0:32 stack is DWORD-based.  The 16:16 stack is WORD-based. Stack-based
addressing between the two schemes is therefore different. The thunk must
make a new copy of the parameters on the stack, realigning when needed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Restrictions on the 16:16 addressing scheme</B>
<P>
The 16:16 code can only address up to 64KB in any segment.  The only limit
on the 0:32 code is the maximum size of the linear address space (4GB).
This disparity creates a problem when a data item in the 0:32 module or
resource is larger than 64KB or is allocated across a 64KB boundary, and
must be passed to a 16:16 routine.  Where possible, the thunk must make
the data item addressable by the 16:16 routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Different call models</B>
<P>
The 0:32 addressing scheme uses <A HREF="324_L2_near.html"><I>near</I></A> calls
for all operating system functions.  The 16:16 scheme uses <A HREF="289_L2_far.html"><I>far
</I></A>calls for operating system functions.  If a procedure using one
scheme tries to call a procedure of the other scheme, different return values
may be placed on the stack.  The thunk is responsible for producing the
correct calling sequence.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The above considerations apply to all executable programs, libraries (both
statically and dynamically linked) and Presentation Manager messages.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a number of thunks to handle function calls from
16-bit applications to 32-bit service layers, and vice versa.  Almost all
of the thunks in OS/2 Version 2.0 are of the 0:32 to 16:16 conversion kind,
except for those that handle semaphores and<B> DosSubxxxx()</B> service
calls.  Thunks are packaged with the module that contains the supporting
code for the 16-bit and/or the 32-bit entry point.  See <A HREF="015_L2_Thunks16Bitversus32B.html">Figure
"Thunks - 16-Bit versus 32-Bit"</A> for an overview of the two different
types of thunks. This implementation of mixed 16:16 and 0:32 applications
also raises a number of considerations:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Each resource will effectively occupy at least 4KB
(one page), since this is the minimum allocated in the 32-bit environment.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Stack size is a maximum of 64KB, since this is the
maximum addressable by the 16-bit portion of the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->In Presentation Manager applications, caution must
be exercised when passing user-defined messages between window procedures
in modules that use different addressing models; such messages will require
application-defined thunks.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Presentation Manager hooks should<I> only</I> be used
with system-defined message contents.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When developing 32-bit applications using 16-bit modules, the programmer
is responsible for supplying appropriate address conversion via thunks,
for<!-- entering slot 97 --> pointers passed as parameters and for application-defined
messages under Presentation Manager. These considerations and restrictions
are discussed further in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
