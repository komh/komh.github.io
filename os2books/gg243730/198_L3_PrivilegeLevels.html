<H1>Privilege Levels</H1><!-- entering slot 221 -->
<P>
The 80386 implements a four-level protection mechanism.  Level 0 is the
most privileged, and level 3 is the least privileged.  The privilege level
is assigned on a segment basis, and therefore applies to both code and data.
 The four levels may be visualized as concentric "rings", with the most
privileged segments in the center.
<P>

Scheme"</A>
<P>
All code and data segments in the system are assigned a privilege, which
is stored in the segment descriptor.  At any one moment, a task executes
only on one of the four rings:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Ring 0</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> This is the most privileged type of
segment, and code executing in this ring may use all protected mode processor
instructions.  This ring is used by those routines in an operating system
which are essential for resource allocation and control.  This part of the
system is often referred to as the kernel or nucleus.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Ring
1</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> This is the second most privileged ring and
is normally used for the remainder of the operating system routines and
for the input/output support routines.  Note that ring 1 is<I> not</I> used
by OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Ring 2</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> This
ring is typically used as the application services level.  It should be
used for routines that do not belong to the operating system, but should
still be protected from user code.  Communications support and database
management programs are good examples.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Ring 3
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>This is the least privileged ring and is typically
assigned to user application code and data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
A task executing in one ring cannot access data in a more privileged ring
(for example, ring 3 cannot access data at ring 1), nor can it invoke a
procedure in a less privileged ring (for example, ring 1 cannot invoke ring
3).  Thus, both access to data and transfer of control are restricted in
appropriate ways.  The processor interprets the protection parameters and
automatically performs all the checking necessary to implement this protection.

<P>
Although at the segment level there are these four levels of privilege,
at the page level there are only two privilege levels:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Supervisor level, for the operating system, privileged
programs, such as device drivers, and system data including page tables
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->User level for application code and data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
The privilege levels used for segmentation are mapped into the page level
privilege levels.  Tasks running in ring 0, 1 or 2 are all assumed to at
supervisor privilege level.
