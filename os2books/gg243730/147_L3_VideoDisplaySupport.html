<H1>Video Display Support</H1><!-- entering slot 163 -->
<P>
At general availability OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the most complete support
for video systems which provide VGA resolution.  This is the only resolution
supported for "seamless" WIN-OS/2 sessions at this time and if using "seamless"
WIN-OS/2 on a particular system, the Presentation Manager desktop must be
configured to use this resolution even if the display hardware is capable
of higher resolution output.
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 provides support for devices with lower resolutions than VGA,
namely CGA and EGA, for all types of sessions except "seamless" WIN-OS/2.
 Use of CGA for Presentation Manager is not recommended.
<P>
Devices with resolutions above VGA (640x480, 16 colors) are known as Super
VGA (SVGA).  The OS/2 installation process will detect display systems capable
of running in SVGA mode. However, because of the wide variety of display
systems currently available that fall into this category, full support is
not provided.
<P>
Support is provided for 8514 and XGA display systems and drivers for Presentation
Manager and WIN-OS/2 full-screen sessions will be installed during system
installation.  All other SVGA display systems will be supported in VGA mode.
 Systems with 8514 and XGA display hardware can also run in VGA mode.
<P>
Support however is provided to allow DOS full-screen and WIN-OS/2 full-screen
sessions to use the display system in SVGA mode even though Presentation
Manager is using it as a VGA device.  A base video device handler (VDH)
is provided which permits switching the display system between VGA and an
SVGA mode. The list of video modes currently supported is:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
SVGA support is enabled by:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Including the SVGA base VDH, which is installed along
with the VGA VDH, by changing the SET VIO_VGA statement in the CONFIG.SYS
to:
<PRE>         SET VIO_VGA=DEVICE(BVHVGA,BVHSVGA)</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By running SVGA.EXE
<P>
From a DOS full-screen command prompt issue the command:
<PRE>         <B>SVGA ON</B></PRE>

<P>
Executing this program will result in a file called SVGADATA.PMI being created
in the OS2 directory.  This file contains the information about the video
modes supported by the video adapter present in the system.
<P>
This file also serves a flag to say that SVGA mode is enabled in the system.
 The SVGA support is only active once the SVGA program has been run.  SVGA
VDHs will run in VGA mode if the SVGADATA.PMI file is not present.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Install the SVGA virtual VDH instead of the VGA VDH.

<P>
This substitution provides support for DOS full-screen sessions to run in
SVGA mode. The VVGA.SYS virtual VDH is replaced by VSVGA.SYS by changing
the DEVICE statement in the CONFIG.SYS to read:
<PRE>          DEVICE=x:\OS2\MDOS\VSVGA.SYS

      where x = the drive letter of the system partition</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Install a Windows V3.0 driver for the SVGA adapter
in the system to provide support for WIN-OS/2 full-screen sessions.
<P>
If a Windows V3.0 driver is available for the adapter, this should work
under OS/2 V2.0. Update the "display.drv=" line in the SYSTEM.INI file in
the \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2 directory to point to the new driver.  The DEVICE statement
for the video driver in the CONFIG.SYS also needs to be changed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
To disable SVGA support run the SVGA.EXE program with the OFF parameter:

<PRE>          <B>SVGA OFF</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Changing DOS settings may rectify problems experienced when running with
SVGA enabled:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If corruption occurs when switching to the WIN-OS/2
full-screen session, turn<B><!-- entering slot 164 --> VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION
</B>ON.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If difficulty is experienced with animated graphics,
turn<B> VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION</B> OFF.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Some manufacturers of SVGA hardware are working to develop OS/2 V2.0 video
device drivers that will support Presentation Manager. It is advisable to
check with the hardware supplier about the availability of drivers for a
particular video subsystem. Information will also be posted on OS/2 bulletin
boards and these can be checked for the latest information.
