<H1>FDISK Program</H1><!-- entering slot 182 -->
<P>
The full-screen version of FDISK is used during installation of the operating
system.  It provides users with the same functions as the FDISKPM version.
 The full-screen version looks and acts in much the same way as FDISKPM,
but does not support a mouse. The FDISK full-screen interface is shown in
<A HREF="030_L2_FDISKUtilityinFullSc.html">Figure "FDISK Utility (in Full-Screen
Mode)"</A>.
<P>
In order to enable the initial installation environment where Presentation
Manager facilities are not available, the FDISK program provides a command
line interface with similar capabilities to those provided by the FDISKPM
program.  When combined with the setboot command line utility, the FDISK
command line interface also allows modification of logical drive environments
and changes to Boot Manager values via batch files or remote command line
interfaces such as DCAF, for use in unattended environments.
<P>
The following syntax shows how to use the FDISK command:
<PRE>&lt;Drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt; <B>FDISK</B> parameter:value &lt;/option:value&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The<B><I> PARAMETERS:VALUE</B></I>  specified in the FDISK command may be
one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B><LI>QUERY</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Displays a list of all partitions
and free space on the hard disks of the system.  To display a list of all
partitions and free space on the hard disks of the system, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /CREATE:name</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Creates
a primary partition or logical drive in an extended partition.  You can
specify an optional name for the created partition.  You must specify the
type of partition being created by using the /VTYPE:n option where n = 1
for a primary partition and 2 for a logical drive in an extended partition.
 To create a logical drive in an extended partition on disk 1 with the name
OS2FAT, type: FDISK /CREATE:OS2FAT /VTYPE:2 /DISK:1<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /DELETE
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL>Deletes a logical drive or primary partition.
 This parameter must be used with one or more options.  You can use /DELETE:all
to delete all logical drives on a disk.  If you use /DELETE:all, however,
you must specify the disk using the /DISK option.  To delete a logical drive
with the name OS2FAT, type:
<BR>
FDISK /DELETE /NAME:OS2FAT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /SETNAME:name</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
names for primary partitions or logical drives and makes them bootable from
the Boot Manager.  If the name is left blank, the boot name is removed and
the partition will not be bootable from the Boot Manager menu.  To specify
the name DOS4.0 of a primary partition, type:
<BR>
FDISK /SETNAME:DOS4.0<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /SETACCESS</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Sets
a primary DOS partition as accessible.  Once a primary DOS partition has
been set as accessible, all other primary DOS partitions on the same drive
are inaccessible.  If there are two primary DOS partitions on a hard disk,
specifying this parameter with no options makes the previously inaccessible
partition accessible and changes the previously accessible partition to
inaccessible.  To specify a primary DOS partition as accessible type:
<BR>
FDISK /SETACCESS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /STARTABLE</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
a partition as startable.  To specify a partition as startable, type:
<BR>
FDISK /STARTABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /FILE:filename</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Processes
all FDISK commands in the specified file allowing the batching of FDISK
commands.  You must have commas separating the arguments of each command
in the file and the commands are processed just once.  For example, the
file MYFILE contains the following commands:
<PRE>  /query
  /create:OS2,/vtype:1,/disk:1,/name:01000030,/size:20
  /startable,/name:OS2
  /query,/name:OS2
</PRE>

<P>
The processing of these commands is as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> Command
1: displays a list of all partitions and unused space on all hard disks.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
Command 2: creates a primary partition on disk 1 with a size of 20MB in
the free space alias 01000030 and assigns it a boot name of OS2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
Command 3: sets the partition named OS2 to be the startable partition.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
Command 4: displays the partition information of the partition named OS2.
To process FDISK commands in the file MYFILE, type:
<BR>
FDISK /FILE:myfile<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>OPTIONS</B></I>  limit the actions of the FDISK command and parameters.
 The valid options and their associated values are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B><LI>NAME:name</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Indicates the name of a partition.
 A name can be up to<!-- entering slot 183 --> eight characters in length
and is case-sensitive.  The /NAME option can be used with all FDISK parameters
except /FILE.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> During a QUERY operation, a temporary name is assigned to
every partition and free space that does not have a boot name assigned.
This name is not set as the partition name, but is only used as a temporary
identifier for the user. Because they will not have a visual representation
of the FDISK screen, these temporary names can be used in place of real
names for the NAME option. To delete a partition named dos, type: FDISK
/DELETE /NAME:dos<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /DISK:n</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
the number of the hard disk that you want to work with using the FDISK command
and parameters.  The /DISK option can be used with all FDISK parameters
except /FILE.  To display all partitions on drive 2, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /DISK:2<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> /<B>FSTYPE:x</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
the file system type of the partition.  The type x=DOS, FAT, IFS, Free,
Hnn, or other. "Hnn" is the hex value (nn) of the partition system ID value.

<P>
The /FSTYPE option can be used with all FDISK parameters except /FILE and
/SETACCESS. To display a partition with a FAT file system, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /FSTYPE:FAT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /START:m</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
the partition starting location. Specify  m=t or m=b, where t=top of the
partition and b=bottom of the partition. The /START option can be used with
all FDISK parameters except /FILE. To create a primary partition starting
at the top of the partition, type:
<BR>
FDISK /CREATE /START:t<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /SIZE:m</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
the size of the partition where m is the size in MB. The /SIZE option can
be used with all FDISK parameters except /FILE. To create a primary partition
with a size of 8MB, type:
<BR>
FDISK /CREATE /SIZE:8<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /VTYPE:n</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
the type of the partition.  The value of n can be as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> 0
Space is not usable<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI>Primary partition (not shared)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI>Logical drive (shared in an extended partition)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI>Free space that can be used to create a primary or extended partition.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The
/VTYPE option can be used with all FDISK parameters except /FILE, /SETACCESS,
and /STARTABLE.
<BR>
To display unusable space on a disk, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /VTYPE:0
<BR>
To specify a primary partition to be displayed, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /VTYPE:1
<BR>
To specify a logical drive in an extended partition to be displayed, type:

<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /VTYPE:2
<BR>
To display free space that can be used to create a primary or extended partition,
type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /VTYPE:3<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /BOOTABLE:s</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Indicates
the bootable status of partitions; s=0 for partitions that are not bootable;
s=1 for partitions that are bootable.  The /BOOTABLE option can be used
with all FDISK parameters except /FILE. To display all partitions that are
bootable from the Boot Manager menu, type:
<BR>
FDISK /QUERY /BOOTABLE:1<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /BOOTMGR</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Specifies
an action for the Boot Manager partition. To create the Boot Manager partition,
