<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 makes use of two distinct types of device drivers to communicate
between the operating system and hardware devices:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Physical device drivers</B> communicate directly
with hardware devices
<P>
They operate in protected mode, and are accessed by protected mode processes
and by virtual device drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Virtual device drivers</B> (VDD) do not communicate
directly with hardware devices; instead, they provide a virtual device driver
interface for DOS applications running in virtual DOS machines
<P>
Some VDDs have an associated physical device driver to which they pass requests.
VDDs are 32-bit device drivers and make it possible for devices to be shared
between processes running in virtual DOS machines and OS/2 screen groups.

See<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I> for
a complete discussion of OS/2 Version 2.0 virtual device drivers.
