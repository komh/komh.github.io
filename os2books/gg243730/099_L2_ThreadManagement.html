<P>
Under previous versions of OS/2, there was a limitation of 53 threads per
process.  Under Version 2.0, this limitation is lifted, and the thread limit
for each process is now the same as the overall system limit, that is, a
total of 4096 threads.  Note, however, that the operating system itself
consumes some threads, so the practical number of threads available to an
application will be fewer than 4096.
<P>
The number of threads available is also affected by the THREADS= statement
in CONFIG.SYS.  This statement sets the maximum number of threads available
in the system; hence the number of threads available to applications will
be the number specified in this statement, less the number of threads consumed
by the operating system.
