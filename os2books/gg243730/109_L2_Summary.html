<H1>Summary</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a comprehensive set of debugging facilities which
may be used to develop powerful application debugging tools.  These facilities
make use of the debug registers present in the 80386 processor, and allow
debugging on a per-process basis. The debugging of multi threaded applications
is possible. It is also possible to debug code residing in DLLs.
<P>
Access to the debugging facilities is provided through the<B> DosDebug()
</B>function call.  Debugging services are requested by repetitive use of
this function call with different command parameters.
<P>
The<B> DosDebug()</B> function replaces the<B> DosPTrace()</B> function
implemented in previous versions of OS/2.  However, the<B> DosPTrace()</B> function
is implemented under OS/2 Version 2.0 as a 16-bit entry point, thereby allowing
debugging tools written for previous versions of OS/2, and which use the
<B>DosPTrace()</B> function, to be used under Version 2.0.
