<P>
The process of installation has been greatly improved for OS/2 Version 2.0
over previous versions of OS/2.  Once partitioning of the fixed disk and
installation of the base operating system has been accomplished, the remainder
of the installation procedure is carried out using a graphical installation
procedure which runs under Presentation Manager.  Full mouse and keyboard
support is provided.
<P>
Progress indicators are given, allowing the user to easily determine the
current point in the process.  Optional features are installed by selecting
them from a list of icons.  Default settings for properties such as display
and mouse type are determined by interrogating the hardware; these defaults
may easily be altered by the user.
<P>
For those users who may not be familiar with use of the system, a tutorial
is provided as part of the graphical installation procedure.  This tutorial
illustrates the use of windows, the keyboard and mouse, and drag-and-drop
manipulation using icons.
<P>
Installation of specific optional features may be carried out after the
operating system is installed, in an easier manner than with previous versions
of OS/2.  The graphical installation procedure is available from the Presentation
Manager desktop or from the command line, and may be invoked to install
only specific optional features.
