<P>
Once options are configured (or the user indicates that the default options
are to be used), the user is prompted to insert the next diskette into the
machine.  A <A HREF="023_L2_InstallationProgress.html">progress indicator
</A>is then displayed, which shows the name of the file currently being
installed, and the percentage of data on the current diskette that has already
been copied.
<P>
The progress through the installation is also displayed by the use of diskette
icons at the bottom of the screen; the diskette currently being copied is
displayed with a highlighted border around it.
