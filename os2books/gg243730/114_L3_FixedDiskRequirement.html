<H1>Fixed Disk Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 122 -->
<P>
When all installable options are selected, OS/2 Version 2.0 requires 30MB
of fixed disk space in which to install itself.  Approximately 26MB is used
by the operating system files and 4MB used in the initial SWAPPER.DAT file.
This usage may be substantially reduced if some of the installable options
are omitted.  Users should ensure that the required amount of fixed disk
space is available in their system.
<P>
If partitioning the fixed disk for multiple partitions, users should ensure
that the partition into which OS/2 Version 2.0 is to be installed is of
sufficient size to accommodate the operating system and required options.
 A recommended<I> minimum</I> partition size is 40MB.
<P>
Don't forget to plan for the appropriate amount of fixed disk space to hold
the SWAPPER.DAT file.  This file will grow rapidly when overcommitting the
system resources (memory).  Also, the \SPOOL subdirectory holds print jobs
that have been spooled and are waiting to be printed.  This subdirectory
can quickly use up available disk space if large or complex print jobs are
sent. The default path for the spool path is \SPOOL on the drive the operating
system is installed on.  The spool path can be changed by opening<I> Spooler
</I>settings by selecting in turn<I> OS/2 System</I> from the Desktop,<I> System
Setup</I> and<I> Spooler</I>.
<P>
Partitioning fixed disks for support of OS/2 Version 2.0 is also discussed
in <A HREF="152_L1_BootManager.html">Boot Manager</A>.
