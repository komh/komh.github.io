gate
<P>
Specialized form of segment base address in memory, to which control is
passed by an application when that application requires the execution of
code which must run at a different privilege level.  The gate routine then
redirects control to the appropriate routine to perform the function.  The
use of gates insulates the calling application from the called routine,
thereby providing greater protection.
