<P>
Boot Manager provides the capability to install and run multiple operating
systems concurrently in the same machine.  The user may select the desired
operating system at system power-on or at IPL-time, using a selection menu
provided by Boot Manager.
<P>
Operating systems reside on logical drives in both primary and extended
fixed disk partitions.  Partitions are created and manipulated using the
FDISK, FDISKPM, and SETBOOT utilities provided with OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
Operating systems may share applications and data files, provided that the
disk formats supported  by each operating system are compatible.  In order
to be shared, such files must reside on logical drives in extended fixed
disk partitions, or on physically separate disks.
