<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides significant enhancements in memory management
over previous versions of OS/2.  Full use is made in Version 2.0 of the
32-bit addressing and paged virtual memory capabilities of the Intel 80386
processor, giving theoretical access to 4GB of memory per process.  In practical
terms, however, it is unlikely that the full amount of memory could be used,
due to other constraining factors such as hardware limitations.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 manages its memory as a single linear address space of
up to 4GB in size.  This global address space is divided into a number of
regions.  The region below 512MB is known as the process address space,
and is available to applications for storage of executable code, resources
and data.  The region above 512MB is reserved for operating system use.
 The choice of 512MB as the dividing line between the two regions allows
16-bit applications and resources, written for previous versions of OS/2,
to be executed and address memory within the process address space.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 allocates memory in multiples of 4KB; each 4KB unit is
known as a page.  An application may request larger memory objects, and
may access and manipulate these objects as logical entities, but the operating
system internally manages each page as a separate unit.  This allows a more
efficient virtual memory implementation, since individual pages may be swapped
in and out of real storage, rather than entire memory objects. Page swapping
is typically faster, especially when memory objects become very large.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 allows 16-bit applications and resources to execute within
any process, since all processes execute in memory within the 16:16 addressing
scheme limit of 512MB.  OS/2 Version 2.0 also allows interaction between
16-bit and 32-bit modules within a process, and provides address conversion,
parameter conversion, stack alignment, etc., between 16:16 and 0:32 addressing
schemes using thunk layers.
<P>
The memory management implementation under OS/2 Version 2.0, therefore,
provides access to larger amounts of physical and virtual storage in a more
efficient manner than previous versions of OS/2, and removes many of the
constraints imposed by previous versions.  At the same time, it maintains
compatibility with 16-bit applications and resources.
