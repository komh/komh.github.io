<H1>Adapter Components</H1><!-- entering slot 247 -->
<P>
The different parts of the adapters are illustrated in <A HREF="044_L2_AdapterComponentBloc.html">Figure
"Adapter Component Block Diagram"</A>, and are described below:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Local microprocessor, RAM and ROM</B>
<P>
An Intel 80188 microprocessor controls the operation of the adapter. It
translates commands received from the system into a series of operations
to implement the desired results. The processor also manages the intelligent
buffer, controls data transfers to and from the system, controls the SCSI
bus, and handles error detection/recovery.
<P>
The program code that controls the processor is stored in a local read-only
memory (ROM) module. There is also a Random Access Memory (RAM) module available
for storage of work information.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>System interface controls</B>
<P>
The system interface controls provide command and interrupt registers that
allow the processor to receive commands from the system and to interrupt
the system when a command is complete.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>SCSI bus control</B>
<P>
The SCSI bus control chip is an electronic circuit module used by the processor
to control the SCSI bus.  It is used to transmit commands, receive status
information and transfer data between the adapter card and attached SCSI
devices. It also provides the following functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->SCSI bus arbitration<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->SCSI device selection/reselection<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->SCSI bus parity generation/checking<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Diagnostics and self-testing capabilities.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Intelligent
buffer</B>
<P>
This buffer is a 512KB parity-checked RAM module, and is only available
on the 32-bit high-performance version of the SCSI adapter. This buffer
has two basic functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->It serves as a prefetch cache and keeps frequently
used or prefetched SCSI device data available for immediate transfer to
the system without the normal device-dependent physical access delay.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->It buffers the SCSI device data until it can
be transferred to the system RAM via DMA. This allows the SCSI bus data
transfer to be asynchronous to the Micro Channel data transfer, permitting
interleaving of transfer operations, and providing enhanced performance.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Buffer
and data flow controls</B>
<P>
This circuit module manages the flow of parallel data between the SCSI bus,
the intelligent buffer, and the Micro Channel. The circuit is controlled
by the processor and can perform all transfers simultaneously. It supports
32-bit to 16-bit conversion, burst mode DMA, odd byte/word transfers and
parity generation/checking of the buffer data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>SCSI
BIOS</B>
<P>
The SCSI BIOS consists of a set of ROM modules, which contain the basic
input/output support code for the adapter. It provides both the compatibility
(CBIOS) and advanced (ABIOS) support for any attached SCSI fixed disk. The
BIOS ROM is completely independent from the processor's ROM on the adapter.
BIOS is discussed further in <A HREF="224_L3_SCSIBIOS.html">SCSI BIOS</A>.
