<H1>Basic Data Transfer Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 238 -->
<P>
The basic transfer cycle on the Micro Channel is a minimum of 200 ns (100
ns for the address and 100 ns for the data which results in five million
basic transfer cycles per second for a device running in burst mode. As
shown in <A HREF="040_L2_BasicDataTransferMod.html">Figure "Basic Data Transfer
Mode"</A>, a data transfer operation is done in two steps. First the address
for the transfer (either I/O adapter or memory location) is selected, then
up to four bytes of data is moved across the data buffer.
<P>
Depending of the width of the data path (8, 16, or 32 bits) the instantaneous
data transfer rate on the channel would be 5, 10, or 20MB per second.
<P>
The<I> matched-memory</I> extension is a modification to the basic data
transfer mode, which can improve the data transfer capabilities between
the system master and channel-attached memory. When supported, it allows
the basic transfer cycle of 200 ns to be reduced.
<P>
The DMA controller on the system board requires two basic transfer cycles
to move either 8 bits or 16 bits of data.  It moves the data from the originator
to a buffer in the DMA controller and then to the target device or memory
location.  Because two cycles are used per 8 or 16 bits of data, the data
transfer rate for DMA controllers is 2.5MB or 5MB per second.
