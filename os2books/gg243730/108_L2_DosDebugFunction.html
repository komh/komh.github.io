<H1>DosDebug() Function</H1><!-- entering slot 116 -->
<P>
The debugging services provided by the operating system are accessed using
the <A HREF="283_L2_DosDebug.html"><B>DosDebug()</B></A> function.  Debugging
services are obtained by repeated calls to<B> DosDebug()</B>, thereby simplifying
the interface and increasing portability.
<P>
This function replaces the<B> DosPTrace()</B> function implemented in previous
versions of OS/2.  However, the<B> DosPTrace()</B> function is still  available
under OS/2 Version 2.0 as a 16-bit entry point, thus allowing debugging
tools written for previous versions of OS/2 to be used to debug 16-bit applications.

<P>
The typical application programmer is unlikely to use the DosDebug() function.
 It is intended to be used by developers of high-level application debugging
tools.
<P>
The syntax of<B> DosDebug</B> call is shown in <A HREF="017_L2_DosDebugFunction.html">Figure
"DosDebug Function"</A>.
<P>
The<I> DbgBuf</I> parameter is a pointer to a data structure, which contains
values used to control the execution of the<B> DosDebug()</B> function.
One of the fields within the structure is used to hold a command word.  On
return, the same field contains a notification code.  Commands may result
in the reading or writing of memory, single stepping through the program,
changing values in registers or the setting of watchpoints. The notifiers
indicate events such as the loading of a DLL, encountering a breakpoint
during program execution and watchpoint hits. The command to be executed
is placed in the<I> DbgBuf</I> structure together with the necessary additional
information for that specific command.  The structure contains fields for
all registers present in the system.  There are other fields in the structure
which are command specific.  There are also fields for the process ID and
the thread ID which identify the target for the debug command.
<P>
The<B> DosDebug()</B> function, its commands, parameters and return codes
are described in detail in the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program Reference</I>.

<P>
The<B> DosDebug()</B> function executes synchronously; that is, the debugging
process executing the call must wait for the function to complete and return
control before it may continue execution.
<P>
The result of the<B> DosDebug()</B> call is a return code and an update
of the command field with a notification code.  See <A HREF="018_L2_SampleDosDebugFuncti.html">Figure
"Sample DosDebug Function Call"</A>.
<P>
If this is the first<I> DBG_C_Go</I> command to be issued, a typical return
code is RC = 0, and the notifier placed in the command field is set =<I> DBG_N_ModuleLoad</I>.
This return implies that the application has just loaded an executable module
and will always occur at program start.  A notification is generated for
each module loaded.  Because there may be several DLLs loaded when the program
is started, there will be several notifications pending.  Only a single
notification is returned on each<B> DosDebug</B> call.  The debugger must
issue<I> DBG_C_Stop</I> commands to retrieve all the outstanding<I> DBG_N_ModuleLoad
</I>notifications.
