<P>
The debug component of OS/2 Version 2.0 consists of a set of system services
which make it possible to trace and locate problems in programs, in order
to increase productivity during the testing phase of the application development
process. These services make use of the debug registers present in the Intel
80386 processor to implement features such as data watchpoints and soft
instruction breakpoints.  By  using these registers, it becomes possible
to implement watchpoints and breakpoints without making modifications to
the code being debugged.
<P>
The debug component<I> does not</I> provide a complete debugging tool, but
merely provides a mechanism whereby one process may control and monitor
the execution of one or more related processes.  It provides the services
which are used by debugging tools such as the C Set/2 debugger. Debug provides
functions such as single-stepping through a program, interrogation of processor
registers and locations in memory and changing the contents of registers
and locations in memory.  The debugging tool provides the user interface
which displays source code listings, allows the user to set breakpoints,
start execution of a program and to monitor changes in the value of program
variables.
