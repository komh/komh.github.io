<H1>Real Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 211 -->
<P>
When the 80386 is powered up or re-initialized via a hardware reset, the
processor is set into real mode.  In real mode, the 80386 effectively operates
as a 16-bit processor. While in real mode the 80386 is emulating an 8086
processor.  Program addresses correspond directly to physical memory addresses.
 Memory is addressed using the segmented memory model only (paging is not
supported), and the system's physical address space is limited to 1MB of
real memory. Virtual memory is not supported in real mode.
<P>
While running in real mode, the Intel 80386 does not implement any memory
protection scheme.  Real mode is not suitable for running multiple applications
concurrently.  When more than one program is loaded at a time, there is
the possibility of one program accessing another program's memory.  Also
there is no protection for the operating system code, and application programs
can overwrite operating system code and data.
<P>
Segment registers are used to supply the base address for each type of memory
segment (DS - data segment, CS - code segment, SS - stack segment and ES
- extra segment). <A HREF="034_L2_RealModeAddressing.html">Figure "Real
Mode Addressing"</A> shows how a segment is addressed in real mode.
<P>
Each memory reference consists of a 16-bit<B> segment address</B> and a
16-bit<B> offset</B>.  The processor automatically adds four binary zeros
to the segment selector value (equivalent to multiplying by 16) to obtain
a segment base address in memory.  Thus, a segment may start on any 16-byte
boundary within the 1MB physical address space.
<P>
The required memory location within the segment is determined by adding
the offset to the segment base address.  Since the offset is 16 bits in
length, the maximum offset (and therefore the maximum size of a segment)
is 64KB.
