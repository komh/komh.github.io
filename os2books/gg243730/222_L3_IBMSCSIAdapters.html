<H1>IBM SCSI Adapters</H1><!-- entering slot 246 -->
<P>
IBM currently has available two SCSI adapters, which can be used in Micro
Channel based PS/2s:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>The IBM 16-bit SCSI adapter</B>
<P>
This bus master adapter has a:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->16-bit data capability<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->32-bit address capability.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>The
IBM 32-bit SCSI adapter with cache</B>
<P>
This is also a bus master adapter, which features:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->32-bit data capability<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->32-bit address capability<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->512KB on-board cache.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Up to four adapters may be installed in a PS/2 system at the same time.
The two IBM adapters support the following common features:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The attachment of mixed SCSI device types that support
the SCSI Common Command Set (CCS).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Up to seven physical SCSI devices. Each physical device
can support eight logical devices, giving a total of 56 devices per adapter
(SCSI bus).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Overlapped command processing for up to 15 devices.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A data transfer rate of up to 5MB per second from
the adapter to a device on the SCSI bus.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A data transfer rate of up to 16.6MB per second from
the adapter to the system (8.3MB per second for the 16-bit version).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
SCSI devices can be attached to the IBM SCSI adapters both internally and
externally. The adapters have two interface connectors. A connector on the
top edge of the card allows the attachment of devices mounted internally
in the system unit. There is a second connector on the end of the card,
to which the external connection cable attaches.
