<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 treats all processes executing in the system as protected
mode processes.  No real mode support is provided by OS/2 Version 2.0; such
support is not necessary since the Multiple Virtual DOS Machines feature
allows DOS and DOS extender applications such as Microsoft Windows 3.0 applications
to run in virtual DOS machines, which are regarded by the operating system
as protected mode tasks in their own right.  In this way, full pre-emptive
multitasking and memory protection are available to<I> all</I> applications
executing in the system, including DOS and Microsoft Windows applications.
