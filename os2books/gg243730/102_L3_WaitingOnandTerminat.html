<H1>Waiting On and Terminating Threads</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
Under previous versions of OS/2, when an application wished to determine
whether an asynchronous thread had completed execution, it was required
to do so through the use of semaphores, which were periodically checked
by the waiting thread.  OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a<B> DosWaitThread()</B> function
which allows an application to determine whether a given thread is currently
executing, and to either wait for the thread to complete, or time-out immediately.

<P>
A thread may also be terminated from within an application using the<B> DosKillThread()
</B>function.  Under previous versions of OS/2, a thread could not be forcibly
terminated by another thread, unless its parent process was also terminated.
