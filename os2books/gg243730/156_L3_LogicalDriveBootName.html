<H1>Logical Drive Boot Names</H1><!-- entering slot 173 -->
<P>
A user may assign a <A HREF="270_L2_bootname.html"><B>boot name</B></A> to
a logical drive, to simplify its identification. A boot name is a unique
name which identifies the logical drive for booting, and is independent
of the logical drive letter assigned to the drive by the currently active
operating system. The boot name is only recognized by the Boot Manager.

<P>
Boot names are useful in the event of a hardware reconfiguration where additional
fixed disks are added to the machine. Boot names assigned to logical drives
on the original fixed disk will not change and will still identify the same
area on the disk, unlike the logical drive letters which may change due
to the reconfiguration.
