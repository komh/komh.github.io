<H1>What Can Be Debugged</H1><!-- entering slot 115 -->
<P>
The debug component sees a process as the unit that will be debugged. Debugging
is managed on the basis of a connection between a debugger and a process
that was started to run the program that is to be debugged. The debugging
tool will usually issue either a<B> DosExecPgm</B> or a<B> DosStartSession
</B>call to start the program. When starting the program, flags must be
set in the call to request that the program be started for debugging.  Whether
the program is started as a child process in the same session as the debugger
or as a process in a child session, the connection between the debugger
and the program is process to process.
<P>
The debug component can be used to debug programs running in:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The same screen group (foreground session)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Another screen group<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Detached mode (background session).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
A debugger may debug more than one process simultaneously, but any process
can only be connected to one debugger at any one time. All threads within
a process are accessible to the debugger.
<P>
The debugging services allow access to code and data in both a primary executable
module and in DLLs. Resources such as DLLs are not associated directly with
threads, but are accessed and manipulated by threads.  The debug component,
therefore, supports debugging of the DLLs by permitting the debugger to
observe the memory of the DLL and the registers of a thread while it uses
the DLL.
<P>
The debug component notifies the debugging tool when a DLL is loaded, and
provides the debugging tool with the handle of the module table entry (MTE)
of the DLL. From this the debugging tool is able to determine the name of
the DLL by issuing a<B> DosQueryModuleName</B> call.
<P>
The debug component provides control and information at a hardware level.
It provides access to a process's registers and memory.  It can be used
to start a process executing and provide feedback when the process stops
executing, usually because a breakpoint has been encountered.  It provides
a notification when a new thread is created in a process and when the contents
of designated memory location change. It does not trace the passage of system
API calls through the system. It does not understand resources implemented
by the operating system. The debug component provides no information about:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Semaphores<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Pipes<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Queues<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The debugging tool, therefore, cannot give feedback on the status of semaphores
or the contents of pipes and queues. It is up to the debugging tool to provide
facilities that the application programmer would find useful.  One way of
providing these facilities is for the debugging tool to include additional
routines in an executable module that is being prepared for debugging.  The
execution of these routines could be controlled in the same way that the
debugging tool controls execution of the program being debugged.
<P>
The debug component cannot be used to debug processes running in virtual
8086 mode (that is, applications executing within a virtual DOS machine).
