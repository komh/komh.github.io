<P>
For blocks of sequential data transferred over the Micro Channel, it should
not be necessary to specify the address information more than once. Both
the source and destination devices should update the address for each cycle
by the size of the transferred data. This technique is supported by the
Micro Channel and is known as <A HREF="357_L2_streamingdatamode.html"><B>streaming
data mode</B></A> (or streaming data procedure). Using streaming data mode
with 32-bit transfer, the effective transfer rate is 40MB per second. The
usage of the address and data buses during a data transfer using streaming
data procedure is shown in <A HREF="041_L2_StreamingDataMode.html">Figure
"Streaming Data Mode"</A>.
