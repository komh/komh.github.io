general protection exception
<P>
Operating system error which occurs when an application attempts to access
memory in a page which has not been allocated to that process. OS/2 Version
2.0 allows an application to trap a general protection exception using an
exception handler registered with the operating system.  If an exception
handler is not registered, the operating system will terminate the application
as a result of a general protection exception.  Also known as a Trap 000D.
