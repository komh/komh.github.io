<H1>Interrupt Handling</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
The interrupt manager component of the operating system is responsible for
maintaining the interrupt context for the system.  It dispatches hardware
interrupts to device drivers which are registered for those interrupts.
The interrupt manager is also responsible for supervising the use of the
programmable interrupt controller (8259 PIC).  Since performance is always
a major issue in interrupt handing, particularly with time-critical applications,
special considerations have been taken to ensure the maximum possible performance
levels.
<P>
The functions performed by the interrupt manager are basically similar to
those implemented for previous versions of OS/2.  The interrupt manager
provides the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
The internal implementation of the interrupt manager is very similar to
previous versions of OS/2.  The only major difference between the interrupt
manager in OS/2 Version 2.0 and previous versions is that real mode interrupt
handling is no longer supported; this method of interrupt handling is no
longer needed due to the provision of the Multiple Virtual DOS Machines
feature in OS/2 Version 2.0, which supports DOS applications as virtual
8086 mode tasks.  All hardware and software interrupts from virtual 8086
mode tasks in an 80386 system cause a switch to protected mode.  Thus interrupt
requests issued by DOS applications are translated to the appropriate protected-mode
device service requests by the virtual DOS machine.  This process is explained
more fully in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I>.

<P>
Upon servicing an interrupt, the interrupt manager reschedules all threads
currently pending in the system. This rescheduling is done to ensure that
high priority threads are scheduled and dispatched as soon as possible.
 The only exception is the operating system kernel, which cannot be preempted.
Forced actions such as Ctrl+Break or<B> DosKillProcess()</B> must be serviced
before more application code is executed. This priority is necessary to
avoid situations where a process is terminated by the user and an instruction
from this process is then executed before the operating system processes
the interrupt.  Interrupt priorities are therefore checked by the interrupt
manager upon receiving each interrupt.
