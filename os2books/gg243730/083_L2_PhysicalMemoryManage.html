<H1>Physical Memory Management</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
The previous discussion has concentrated on the application's view of memory
management. Applications running under OS/2 Version 2.0 need not even be
aware of the mechanism through which the 0:32 addressing scheme is implemented;
the application<I> only</I> deals with 32-bit addresses, and is not concerned
with the way these are mapped to physical addresses in processor storage.

<P>
When using the flat memory model, the 80386 processor regards each memory
address as a 32-bit address, seen solely as an offset from address 0 into
a linear address space.  If the 80386 processor is running with paging disabled,
this linear address and the physical address in memory are equal. Physical
memory is now divided 4KB blocks, which is allocated as required to processes
running in the system. There is no direct correlation between the linear
address of a page and its address in physical storage.  In fact, not all
pages in the linear address space will be represented in physical memory.
 The 80386 processor has a paging subsystem, which handles the conversion
of the linear address into a physical address and also detects situations
where there is no physical page corresponding to a page in the linear address
space.
<P>
Paging is usually carried out without any awareness on the part of an application.
