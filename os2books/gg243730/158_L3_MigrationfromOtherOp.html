<H1>Migration from Other Operating Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 176 -->
<P>
The Boot Manager architecture requires repartitioning of fixed disks already
set up under any operating systems other than OS/2 Version 2.0.  Although
this may seem troublesome, it must be remembered that Boot Manager is only
of use when multiple partitions are allocated, so it is likely that repartitioning
would be necessary to support multiple operating systems.
<P>
Migration from previous versions of OS/2 to OS/2 Version 2.0 with Boot Manager
is eased by installation support that allows migration to the new Boot Manager
scheme with minimal user impact, other than the possible repartitioning
discussed above. A Boot Manager installation on a system that had previous
versions of OS/2 or DOS installed attempts to minimize the impact by providing
as much automatic support during installation time as possible.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> There seems to be the possibility of a conflict between OS/2
V2.0's Boot Manager and other<I> third party disk organizers and boot utilities</I>.
In order to avoid any trouble which could come up after installation of
OS/2 V2.0  in these situations, it is highly recommended that a<I> low-level
format</I> be performed before installing OS/2 V2.0. On a PS/2, such a<I> low-level
format</I>  can be performed by booting from the appropriate<I> reference
diskette</I> and executing the<I> Advanced Diagnostics (CTRL-A)</I>.  Once
Boot Manager is installed, future migration steps will not require such
an operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
