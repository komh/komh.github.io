Memory management is the way in which an operating system allows applications
to access memory, either for private use by a single application or to be
shared between applications.  In either case, it is the responsibility of
the operating system's memory management component to supervise the correct
use of memory and to ensure that no application gains access to memory outside
its own address space.
<P>
Previous versions of OS/2 were based upon the Intel 80286 processor architecture.
 In this architecture, there is a limitation on the amount of memory that
can be addressed as a single unit.  This is due to the fact that memory
is managed in segments of up to 64KB in size.  Previous versions of OS/2
maintained a series of descriptor tables for memory segments, and 16 bits
were allocated in each table entry for the length of the segment. Thus,
each descriptor table entry gave access to a segment of up to 2^16 = 64KB
in size.
<P>
The particular implementation of the segmented memory model within the 80286
processor allowed a minimum segment size of 1 byte.  Hence an application
could request the allocation of a memory segment from 1 byte to 64KB in
size, in a single operation.  These segments formed the basis of memory
allocation within the system, and of the virtual memory implementation by
which memory overcommitment was supported.
<P>
If the need arose for more than 64KB to be used for a single memory object
or data structure, the programmer and the operating system had to take this
limitation into consideration, and implement appropriate algorithms to use
multiple memory segments for a single logical structure.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0, however, is based upon the Intel 80386 processor architecture.
 This processor has a 32-bit addressing scheme in place of the 24-bit overlapped
scheme used in the 80286, thereby giving access to 2^32 = 4GB of memory
in a single logical unit.
<P>
However, if a unit of this size were to be allocated and manipulated in
the same segment-oriented manner as implemented in the 80286, severe problems
would arise.  For instance, the segment could potentially be larger than
the available memory in the system.  An alternative mechanism for memory
manipulation is therefore required with the 80386.
<P>
In the 80386 architecture, memory is split into fixed size units of 4KB.
All memory allocation, addressing, swapping and protection is based on pages.
As with previous versions of OS/2 the total memory, allocated to all processes
running in the system, may exceed the physical memory available. Memory
objects or parts of memory objects, which are not required by the currently
executing process, may be temporarily migrated out to secondary storage
(disk).  When used with a paged memory management scheme, this procedure
is known as<I> paging</I>. An application may request a large amount of
memory, in which case multiple pages are allocated.  However, since virtual
memory is managed on a page-by-page basis, such units of storage may now
exist partly in real memory and partly in a file on disk, thereby significantly
easing the constraints on memory overcommitment.
<P>
OS/2 Version 1.3 moved complete segments between main memory and the swap
file.  The fact that segments were variable in length complicated the management
of both main memory and space in the swap file.  There was also the requirement
to compress memory regularly to reclaim the gaps, which formed when memory
was freed.  Under OS/2 V2.0, in most cases there is no requirement to<!-- entering slot 79 --> find
contiguous pages in memory to satisfy an allocation request. Consequently
there is no need to move pages around in memory.  The exception to this
is the need for buffers used in DMA I/O transfer, which must be in contiguous
locations in memory.
<P>
The remainder of this chapter will explore the memory management capabilities
of the 80386, as implemented by OS/2 Version 2.0, in more detail.
