<H1>Address Conversion and Translation</H1><!-- entering slot 94 -->
<P>
Under previous versions of OS/2, an application addressed memory using the
segmented memory model, which was translated to physical memory addresses
by the operating system using a local descriptor table (LDT), with one LDT
per process.  Under OS/2 Version 2.0, 16:16 references (see <A HREF="076_L2_FlatMemoryModel.html">Flat
Memory Model</A>) are managed by a technique called<B> LDT tiling</B>, which
provides compatibility for 16-bit applications and provides a mechanism
for 32-bit applications to utilize 16-bit libraries.
<P>
A tiled LDT contains up to 8192 descriptors, where the segment base address
in each descriptor is a multiple of 64KB, and each descriptor therefore
points to a 64KB region of memory.  Contiguous descriptors map into a contiguous
linear address space, thereby using a potential maximum of 512MB, and allowing
a 16-bit application to address the 512MB of the process address space in
the compatibility region. <A HREF="013_L2_Mapping1616MemoryRef.html">Figure
"Mapping 16:16 Memory References"</A> shows the way in which memory addresses
within the tiled LDT are mapped into the process address space.
<P>
The addresses within the process address space may be referenced by applications
or modules using the 16:16 addressing scheme, in a similar manner to previous
versions of OS/2.  However, the same physical memory locations may also
be accessed by 32-bit applications and modules using the 0:32 addressing
scheme.  Both the LDT entries used by the 16:16 scheme and the page table
entries used by the 0:32 scheme may translate to the same memory locations.
This translation enables 32-bit applications to make use of 16-bit modules
and resources, and allows 32-bit and 16-bit applications to coexist and
communicate with one another.
<P>
LDTs are managed in a different way from previous versions of OS/2.  Each
LDT is allocated as a sparse object until descriptors are inserted upon
loading an application.  Descriptors for shared memory objects are inserted
downwards commencing at the top of the LDT, whereas private memory object
descriptors are inserted upwards commencing at the bottom of the LDT. This
order reflects the management of the linear address space by the operating
system.  Therefore the minimum LDT size is 8KB, using one page for the shared
descriptors and one page for the private descriptors.  Note that each code
or data selector reserves a full 64KB of linear address space to be able
to handle an eventual reallocation of segments to the maximum size of 64KB.
 See <A HREF="013_L2_Mapping1616MemoryRef.html">Figure "Mapping 16:16 Memory
References"</A>.
<P>
The following memory objects use LDT descriptors:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->16-bit .EXE files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->16-bit .DLL files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>DosAllocSeg()</B> calls<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>DosAllocMem()</B> calls with tiling<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->32-bit .EXE files with tiling<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->32-bit .DLL files with tiling.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This use of descriptors is effectively equivalent to the implementation
used in the previous versions of OS/2.  It must be noted, however, that
a memory object greater than 64KB may not be handled in an orderly manner
by a 16-bit application.
<P>
A memory object allocated in the compatibility region has both a 16:16 address
(far16)<I> and</I> a 0:32 address (near32), allowing access by applications
using either addressing scheme.  The two types of addresses are related
by the following arithmetic functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>near32 = SEL (far16) &gt;&gt; 3 &lt;&lt; 16
+ OFFSET(far16)</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B><I>far16  = MAKEP (HIGH (near32) &lt;&lt; 3 + 7,
LOW (near32) ).</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The term<I> near32</I> refers to the fact that all 0:32 calls are of type
<A HREF="324_L2_near.html"><I>near</I></A> (based on offset only).  The
term<I> far16</I> refers to the fact that 16:16 calls are based on the segment
selector and offset used in combination.  Bit shift right is shown as &gt;&gt;,
and bit shift left is shown as &lt;&lt;.
<P>
32-bit executable modules can therefore create 16:16 aliases for memory
objects in the compatibility region and conversely, 16-bit modules may create
0:32 bit aliases.  As these conversions are arithmetically based, a high
performance address conversion layer may be implemented, assuring<!-- entering slot 95 --> automatic
address conversion between 16:16 and 0:32 memory objects.  See <A HREF="089_L3_Thunking.html">Thunking</A>.
