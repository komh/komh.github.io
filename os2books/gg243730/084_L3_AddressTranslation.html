<H1>Address Translation</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->
<P>
With paging enabled the 80386 processor maps the linear address using an
entry in the page directory and an entry in one of the page tables currently
present in the system.  The page directory and page tables are structures
created in the linear address space. The address translation process is
shown in <A HREF="011_L2_AddressTranslationLi.html">Figure "Address Translation
- Linear Address to Physical Address"</A>. The linear address is split into
three parts:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Page Directory Entry</B> or PDE (10 bits)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Page Table Entry</B> or PTE (10 bits)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Page Offset</B> or PO (12 bits).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 maintains a single page directory for the entire system;
the entries contained within the page directory are unique for each process
in the system, and are copied into the page directory by the operating system
when a task switch occurs.  The page directory entries contain pointers
to the page tables, which in turn point to the memory pages (both shared
and private) belonging to the current process.  The page directory and each
page table are defined to be one page (4KB) in size, and are aligned on
4KB page boundaries.  There is a maximum of 1024 entries per page table,
and a maximum of 1024 page tables per page directory.  Since each page is
4KB in size, this means a single page table gives access to 4MB of memory.
1024 page tables, the maximum, gives access to the full 4GB global address
space.
<P>
The format of page directory entries and page table entries are identical.
The upper 20 bits in each page directory entry specify the address of the
page table, and the lower 12 bits are used to store control and status information.
 This 20-bit address is possible since each page table is aligned on a 4KB
boundary.  Hence, the lower 12 bits of the address are assumed to be zero
for addressing purposes; these 12 bits are in fact used to contain control
and status information.  A page table contains entries pointing to the physical
memory location of the page.
<P>
The address resolution may appear complex, but in fact very little overhead
is involved since the 80386 maintains a cache buffer for page table entries,
known as the <A HREF="363_L2_transactionlookaside.html"><B>translation lookaside
buffer</B> (TLB)</A>. The TLB satisfies most access requests for page tables,
avoiding the necessity to access system memory for PDEs and PTEs.
<P>
When page table entries are changed or during a task switch, the TLB must
be flushed in order to remove invalid entries. Otherwise, invalid data might
be used for address translation.
<P>
For each page frame, a bit in the page table entry known as the<I> present
bit</I> indicates whether the address in that page table entry maps to a
page in physical memory.  When the present bit is set, the page is in memory.
 When the present bit is clear in either the page directory or in the page
table, a page fault is generated if an attempt is made to use a page table
entry for address translation.
