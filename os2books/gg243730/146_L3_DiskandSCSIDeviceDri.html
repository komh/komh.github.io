<H1>Disk and SCSI Device Drivers</H1><!-- entering slot 162 -->
<P>
The layered device driver architecture has made it possible to easily support
IBM and non-IBM disk and SCSI controllers. At the device management driver
level, OS/2 V2.0 supplies two drivers:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>OS2DASD.DMD</B><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> General-purpose support for disk
drives<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> OS2SCSI.DMD</B><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> General-purpose
support for non-disk SCSI devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
OS2DASD.DMD will always be loaded.  OS2SCSI.DMD is only needed when a SCSI
adapter is present.
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 provides a number of adapter device drivers (ADDs) which are specific
to the adapter or adapters installed in the system. At installation time,
OS/2 V2.0 can in most cases sense the adapters installed and will then load
the necessary ADDs and include the necessary BASEDEV statements in the CONFIG.SYS.
ADDs are currently available for all IBM disk devices and some selected
non-IBM adapters.  See the<I> OS/2 V2.0 Online Command Reference</I> and
the<I> README file</I>, which comes with OS/2 V2.0, for details of the supported
adapters.  The<I> README file</I> should always be consulted when using
a non-IBM SCSI adapter.
<P>
At general availability of OS/2 V2.0, support was available for IBM, Future
Domain** and Adaptec** SCSI adapters.
<P>
Shipped with OS/2 V2.0 is a generic disk device driver IBMINT13.I13. When
specific support is not provided for a particular adapter, it should be
possible to use this driver.
