<H1>Beginning Installation</H1><!-- entering slot 123 -->
<P>
Upon commencing the installation of OS/2 Version 2.0, using the installation
diskette, the user is presented with a simple character-based screen which
requests the user to insert the initial operating system diskette into the
diskette drive.  The first six diskettes (installation diskette and operating
system diskettes 1 to 5) are used to prepare and partition the fixed disk,
install Boot Manager and dual boot if required, and load the basic code
required to drive the graphical installation procedure.
<P>
Once this code is transferred to the system's fixed disk, the installation
procedure prompts the user to reboot the system. When the system restarts,
the Presentation Manager shell is loaded and the graphical installation
procedure is immediately invoked. Since the operating system has now been
loaded off the fixed disk, paging is enabled, relieving constraints on real
memory.
<P>
The graphical installation procedure supports both mouse and keyboard input.
A generic mouse driver is provided by the graphical installation procedure,
in order to support mouse input before the specific mouse driver is identified
and loaded.  This means that certain pointing devices might not be usable
at this time and only keyboard input will be accepted.
<P>
The graphical installation procedure first presents the user with a single
<A HREF="019_L2_OS2Version20Installa.html">dialog box</A>, centered on the
screen.  This <A HREF="019_L2_OS2Version20Installa.html">dialog box</A> enables
the user to select one of several options:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Learn how to use a mouse.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Install a basic set of preselected features.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Install all features of OS/2 Version 2.0, accepting
the default values for system options and parameters as assigned by the
installation procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Select particular options and features to install,
allowing modification of system parameters.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These options are displayed to the user as radio buttons.  Since both mouse
and keyboard support are fully enabled within the graphical installation
procedure, the user may use either method to select an option.  The user
then selects the<I> OK</I> pushbutton to continue.
<P>
If the user elects to install all options, the installation procedure immediately
requests that the user insert the next diskette into the diskette drive.

<P>
If the user wishes to select particular options to install, the installation
procedure presents a further series of dialog boxes from which the user
selects the required options and features.  See <A HREF="116_L2_InstallationOptions.html">Installation
Options</A>, below.
