Dynamic Link Library; application module containing routines and/or resources,
which is dynamically linked with its parent application at load time or
runtime rather than during the linkage editing process. The use of DLLs
enables decoupling of application routines and resources from the parent
program, enhancing code independence, facilitating maintenance and reducing
resident memory consumption.
