<H1>Operating System Restrictions</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
Several restrictions apply to the manner in which various versions of operating
systems may be installed under Boot Manager.  These include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Only DOS Versions 3.2 and above are supported by Boot
Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->All supported versions of DOS<I> must</I> be installed
on a primary partition on the first drive and therefore, end up working
on the C: drive only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DOS Versions 3.2 and 3.3<I> must</I> be installed
in a partition that falls wholly within the first 32MB of a fixed disk.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->OS/2 Version 1.3 and earlier versions may only be
installed on a primary partition on the first drive and therefore, end up
working on the C: drive only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Notes:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->An operating system may NOT store its own information
in the Multi-Boot Block or in the Master Boot Record on the physical drive.
 Any such information<I> must</I> be held within the logical disks owned
by that operating system.  Operating systems which do not obey this rule
may not function correctly in the Boot Manager environment, and will compromise
disk integrity.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Other operating systems may leave their partition
<I>startable</I> following installation.  The user would have to use their
FDISK program or boot the OS/2 V2.0  installation diskette to mark the Boot
Manager partition as<I> startable</I> again to enable the Boot Manager menu
at startup.  See also <A HREF="161_L3_BootManagerInstallat.html">Boot Manager
Installation</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
