<H1>Micro Channel Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 231 -->
<P>
In "conventional" personal computer architectures such as the original IBM
PC and PC AT, the system bus formed the data path, by which hardware components
exchanged information with one another. The bus operated under the direct
control of the system's main processor, and could handle only a single task
at any time.
<P>
The Micro Channel architecture defines a set of specifications for a high-speed
data "highway" connecting the system processor or processors, memory, I/O
devices, and hardware adapters. The main feature that distinguishes the
Micro Channel from the older PC bus is that the system processor does not
have exclusive control of it but other processors and intelligent adapter
cards, which are connected to the channel, can take charge of it and initiate
data transfers across it. The mechanism, by which control of the Micro Channel
is shared amongst the competing subsystems, is known as<I> arbitration</I>.
The Micro Channel consists of a number of buses, controlled by the bus arbitration
unit, which operate independently of the system's main processor. The main
components of the Micro Channel are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Arbitration Bus</B>
<P>
The arbitration bus and its associated signals are used by the bus arbitration
unit to prioritize and resolve up to 16 concurrent requests by intelligent
devices (known as<I> masters</I>) for control of the channel. The system
processor has the lowest priority level, leaving 15 levels available for
other processors and intelligent devices in the system. Although the system
processor is defined to have the lowest priority level, it always "owns"
the channel whenever the channel is not being used by another device. The
arbitration unit resolves contending requests, and selects one device as
the temporary owner of the channel; this device is then known as the<B> controlling
master</B>. The controlling master may then perform a single data transfer
or if the channel had been requested in "burst mode", multiple data transfers.
For "burst transfers", the controlling master owns the channel until the
transfer is complete or another arbitration participant requests ownership
of the channel. In such cases the controlling master must relinquish ownership
of the channel within 7.8 microseconds.
<P>
The arbitration controller has a<I> fairness</I> algorithm built into it
to ensure that subsystems with high priority do not monopolize the channel
at the expense of lower priority subsystems. There is also a feature known
as<I> pre-emption</I>, which allows a subsystem with an urgent requirement
to request and be given control of the channel even though another subsystem
is currently using it.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Address Bus</B>
<P>
The address bus and its associated signals are used by the controlling master
to select a<I> slave</I> to be the source or target for a data transfer.
The Micro Channel addressing consists of two separate address spaces:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The<B> I/O address space</B> consists of 64KB (65535)
I/O addresses. 16 lines of the address bus plus the state of certain associated
control signals signifies the I/O port to be read or written.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The<B> memory address space</B> may be as large as
4GB (4,294,967,296 bytes) for a machine capable of 32-bit addressing. Only
PS/2 Models 90 and 95 are currently capable of 32-bit addressing. All other
system units in the PS/2 range use 24-bit addressing, which allows addresses
up to 16MB (16,<!-- entering slot 232 -->777 , 216bytes ) .<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>DataBus</B>
<P>
The data bus is used to transfer 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits of data between two
masters or between a master and a slave.  The associated control signals
indicate the width and direction (read or write) of the transfer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Micro Channel architecture defines the physical properties of the circuits
and all the timings and signal sequences of signals on these circuits.
<P>
The Micro Channel architecture is<I> extensible</I> in that it has been
possible to include new features in the architecture while maintaining<I> compatibility
</I>with existing devices. All Micro Channel devices are expected to support
certain basic functions. Mechanisms are provided which allow a device that
supports an optional feature to communicate its capability to a partner
device, with which it is exchanging data. If both devices support the feature
then it is enabled for the data transfer operation, if appropriate. If one
device supports a feature and the other device does not, they may still
communicate with one another. Obviously that feature cannot be used during
the data transfer operation.
