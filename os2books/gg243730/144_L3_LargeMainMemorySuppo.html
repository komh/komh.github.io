<H1>Large Main Memory Support</H1><!-- entering slot 159 -->
<P>
The Intel 80386 and 80486 families of microprocessors are capable of addressing
64TB of virtual memory. At present, OS/2 Version 2.0 has the capability
of supporting up to 4GB of virtual memory and 4GB of real memory. In order
to support more than 16MB of memory however, certain requirements must be
met.
<P>
Firstly, the OS/2 V2.0 physical memory manager needs to know how much memory
is present. This is done during kernel initialization by calling the BIOS
interrupt 15 with subfunction code x'88'.  This call will return the total
amount of memory present. If the BIOS supports interrupt 15 with subfunction
code x'C7', "return memory map information", then this function will be
used to return an array giving the layout of the different levels of memory;
for example, system board memory and adapter memory available in the machine,
together with address ranges for the different memory types. Should the
function not be present, the interrupt will return with the carry flag set.
 Support for this function is not mandatory. Information obtained is used
by OS/2 V2.0 to prioritize the areas of physical memory that are allocated
first.
<P>
The second requirement for supporting more than 16MB is that the paging
device fixed disk controller can support data transfers to or from memory
locations above the 16MB line. This ability usually requires the availability
of a DMA controller with a 32-bit addressing capability, either on the system
board or on a busmaster SCSI adapter. To determine whether this DMA is available,
the disk device driver level is queried. If it is a level 3 device driver,
it is further interrogated to find out if the DMA that the disk controller
uses has support for 32-bit addressing. If this second requirement is satisfied
and the disk controller can handle 32-bit addresses larger than 16MB, then
all of memory is used by OS/2 for programs and data.  If it cannot, then
the OS/2 page manager allocates all of the memory above 16MB as a paging
cache to be used before paging to the disk. This substitution is a good
use of the memory above 16MB, but not as good as using it directly.
<P>
A final requirement for supporting more than 16MB is that the machine's
ABIOS is capable of handling requests with addresses above the 16MB line.

<P>
Presently in the IBM PS/2 range, only the Models 90 and 95 have support
for more than 16MB of memory and when using 8MB SIMMs will support up to
64MB. Machines using 80386SX, 80386SL or 80386SLC processors are not able
to support more than 16MB as they only support 24-bit addressing external
to the processor.
<P>
If OS/2 V2.0 detects the presence of a device that does not support 32-bit
addressing, and if support for more than 16MB is enabled, it will ensure
that buffers used by that device's driver are locked below the 16MB line
during I/O operations.  Level 3 device drivers are then given a permanent
buffer below the 16MB line. For level 1 and 2 device drivers the OS/2 V2.0
virtual memory manager, when requested to lock a user buffer for that device,
will move the buffer below the 16MB line.
<P>
The only device for which 32-bit addressing support is mandatory is the
paging device.  Pages are written to or read from their exact physical location
in memory and are not moved before I/O takes place.  Should paging be disabled
by specifying<B> MEMMAN=NOSWAP</B> in the<B> CONFIG.SYS</B>, then more than
16MB can be supported<!-- entering slot 160 --> even though there is no
disk subsystem support for it.
<P>
When determining whether an OEM machine will support more than 16MB, the
considerations are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Is the BIOS/ABIOS in the machine capable of supporting
the memory size?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Is the BIOS capable of telling OS/2 that more than
16MB is present in the machine?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If paging is enabled, does the paging device support
32-bit addressing?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the paging device does support 32-bit addressing,
does its device driver have the capability of responding correctly to OS/2
V2.0 with this information?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
