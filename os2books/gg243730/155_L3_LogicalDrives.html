<H1>Logical Drives</H1><!-- entering slot 172 -->
<P>
Operating systems typically access partitions through <A HREF="315_L2_logicaldrive.html"><B>logical
drives</B></A>, each of which is assigned a logical drive letter.  A primary
partition contains only one logical drive, but an extended partition may
be subdivided into one or more logical drives.  An operating system only
assigns logical drive letters to those partitions with a recognizable format,
that is, supported by the operating system.
<P>
The assignment of drive letters is done by the operating system's volume
manager when the operating system is loaded.  The first physical disk drive
is searched for a recognizable primary partition.  This partition is assigned
the logical drive letter "C" and the next physical disk is searched. After
logical drives in primary partitions have been assigned for all physical
drives, drive letters are assigned to the recognizable logical drives in
extended partitions.
<P>
A different operating system may reside on each of the logical drives in
an extended partition (with certain limitations; see <A HREF="168_L2_OperatingSystemRestr.html">Operating
System Restrictions</A>). Usually, DOS 5.0 and OS/2 V1.3 will only be installed
on a primary partition on the first physical disk.  An exception could be
with DOS, for example, where there are no recognizable primary partitions
on the first physical disk.  In this case DOS (V4.1 or later) may recognize
the primary partition(s) on the first physical drive to be formatted with
the HPFS or Boot Manager, and treat them as unusable to DOS.  In these situations,
the first drive letter C: may be assigned to a primary partition on the
next physical disk.
<P>
Logical drives in extended partitions are shareable; any data installed
on these logical drives can be used by an operating system running from
any other logical drive in the system, provided the partition formats are
compatible. Although 26 logical drive letters are available (A: through
Z:), A: and B: are typically reserved for diskette media. Under DOS or OS/2,
up to 24 logical drives may be created using the logical drive support for
extended partitions.
