<H1>Guard Page Technique</H1><!-- entering slot 84 -->
<P>
When the amount of real storage reserved for a memory object is increased
dynamically by progressive commitment of pages, the application is<I> not
</I>required to explicitly determine whether the next write operation will
exceed the limit of the storage already reserved.  When such a write operation
occurs, the operating system may notify the application, by raising a <A HREF="300_L2_guardpageexception.html"><B>guard
page fault</B></A> exception.
<P>
This technique is useful for situations where storage requirements grow
linearly.  OS/2 V2.0 implements automatic stack growth by using guard pages.
When wishing to limit physical storage requirements but at the same time
allow for situations where large data areas might be needed, an application
should consider using guard pages.  A memory object is allocated with the
largest possible size that might be required. The application then commits
the minimum number of pages, that are required. Usually this would start
at the lowest address in the memory object and proceed upwards.  The application
then marks the next highest page as a <A HREF="299_L2_guardpage.html"><B>guard
page</B></A>. The guard page is also a committed page.
<P>
The application must also register an exception handler.  Exception handlers
are described in <A HREF="098_L2_SignalandExceptionHa.html">Signal and Exception
Handling</A>. When the application tries to write data into the guard page,
a guard page fault will be raised and control passed to the application's
exception handler.  The application must then unguard the current guard
page, commit the next highest page and then set guard on that page.  Should
the application try to access uncommitted storage above the guard page,
a general protection exception will occur.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a default guard page exception handler, which
commits the next<I> lower</I> page in the object;  this is done because
the default handler is written to handle dynamic stack growth.  Stacks are
always propagated downward. For all threads other than the first in any
process, OS/2 V2.0 allocates the stack as a sparse object.  The page with
the highest address is committed and the page immediately below it is marked
as a guard page.  No other pages are committed.  When the guard page is
accessed, the default handler tries to get another guard page below the
current one.  If successful, the original guard page becomes a normal stack
page. An application could allow the default handler to process guard page
exceptions on its private memory objects; however, in most cases the actions
taken by this default handler will not be appropriate and an application
should register its own exception handler.
<P>
Use of the guard page technique is strongly recommended whenever the amount
of data to be written into a memory object is variable, or when the size
of a memory object may increase during execution. The process of creating
and registering an exception handler and of using guard pages and the handling
of guard page exceptions within applications is described in<I> OS/2 Version
2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
