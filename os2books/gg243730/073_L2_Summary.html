<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides significant enhancements over previous versions
of OS/2.  It provides a sophisticated memory management and task management
architecture, allowing full exploitation of the power of the Intel 80386
processor.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the ability to execute multiple concurrent DOS
applications, in full-screen mode or in windows on the Presentation Manager
desktop.  These applications may address I/O devices such as printers, scanners,
and communications adapters.  Each DOS application typically has approximately
630KB of memory in which to execute and store its data;  for those applications
which require more memory, OS/2 Version 2.0 provides emulation of the LIM,
EMS, and XMS memory extenders.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the ability for Windows applications, written
for Windows 3.0 and previous versions of Windows, to execute under OS/2
Version 2.0, concurrently with DOS and OS/2 applications.  Windows applications
execute as protected mode processes, and full memory protection and pre-emptive
multitasking are, therefore, provided for these applications.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a more powerful 32-bit programming environment
which, due to the use of the flat memory model, is free from the limitations
and inherent complexity of the segmented memory model used by DOS and previous
versions of OS/2.  Memory management within applications is greatly simplified,
allowing applications to be developed faster, with better performance due
to reduced memory manipulation overheads.  Through the use of the flat memory
model, applications may be more easily ported to or from other operating
system platforms.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also provides an enhanced user shell, known as the Workplace
Shell, through enhancements to Presentation Manager.  The Workplace Shell
is object-based and implements the 1991 SAA CUA workplace environment.  This
shell is more intuitive than the Presentation Manager shell implemented
in previous versions of OS/2, and allows users to become familiar with the
system more quickly.
