<H1>Flat Memory Model</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
The memory model used by OS/2 Version 2.0 is known as a <A HREF="291_L2_flatmemorymodel.html"><B>flat
memory model</B></A>. This term refers to the fact that memory is regarded
as a single large linear address space of 4GB, using 32 bits for direct
memory addressing. This view applies for each and every process in OS/2
Version 2.0.  Memory addresses are defined using a 32-bit addressing scheme,
which results in a linear address space of 4GB in size.
<P>
Like the 80286 processor, the 80386 also supports a segmented memory model,
except that in the case of the 80386 the maximum segment size is 4GB. While
the 80386 processor does not explicitly provide a facility for disabling
the segmented memory model, OS/2 Version 2.0 implements the flat memory
model by mapping the 4GB address space as a single code segment and a single
data segment, each of which has a base address of zero and a size of 4GB.
Only two segment selectors are therefore required in the system; an executable/readable
code segment in the CS register, and a read/write data segment in the DS,
ES, FS, GS, and SS registers.  These selectors are known as<I> aliases</I>,
since they all map to the same linear address range.  The way, in which
the address space is implemented using the Intel 80386 processor, is explained
in <A HREF="187_L1_Intel80386Architectu.html">Intel 80386 Architecture</A>.

<P>
The 32-bit addressing scheme used by OS/2 Version 2.0 will hereafter be
referred to as <A HREF="374_L2_032.html"><I>0:32</I></A>, in order to differentiate
it from the 16-bit segmented addressing scheme used by previous versions
of OS/2, which will be referred to as <A HREF="375_L2_1616.html"><I>16:16</I></A>.
These terms reflect the fact that the older segmented memory model uses
a 16-bit segment selector and a 16-bit offset to refer to a specific memory
location, whereas the newer flat memory model has no need of a segment selector,
and simply uses a 32-bit offset within the system's linear address space.

<P>
The system's global address space is the entire 4GB linear address space.
Each process has its own <A HREF="344_L2_processaddressspace.html"><B>process
address space</B></A>, completely distinct from that of all other processes
in the system.  All threads within a process share the same process address
space.  This address space is theoretically also 4GB in size.  However,
the maximum size for process address spaces is defined at system initialization
time and is somewhat less than 4GB, to allow space for memory used by the
operating system.
<P>
<A HREF="009_L2_4GBGlobalLinearAddre.html">Figure "4GB Global Linear Address
Space"</A> shows the mapping of a process address space into the system's
global address space.  The<I> NN</I> shown in <A HREF="009_L2_4GBGlobalLinearAddre.html">Figure
"4GB Global Linear Address Space"</A> represents the maximum defined linear
address of the process address space, set at system initialization time.
 OS/2 Version 2.0  sets this limit to 512MB, reserving the linear address
range above this point for operating system use.  The space above 512MB
is known as the <A HREF="358_L2_systemregion.html"><B>system region</B></A>.

<P>
This limitation on the size of the process address space is used by the
operating system to ensure protection of the system region from access by
applications.  See <A HREF="082_L3_MemoryProtection.html">Memory Protection
</A>for further explanation.
<P>
Conceptually, the process address space is divided into two different regions,
as shown in <A HREF="009_L2_4GBGlobalLinearAddre.html">Figure "4GB Global
Linear Address Space"</A>.  One of these regions may be accessed by both
16:16 and 0:32 applications, and is known as the <A HREF="377_L2_1632bitregion.html"><B>16/32-bit
region</B></A> or <A HREF="274_L2_compatibilityregion.html"><B>compatibility
region</B></A>. The other region is accessible by 0:32 applications only,
and is known as the<B> 32-bit region</B>.
<P>
The 16:16 addressing scheme allows access of up to 512MB per process, since
the local descriptor tables used in this model contain up to 8192 entries,
each of which can point to a segment of up to 64KB in size. In order to
ensure that there is no problem in coexisting 16-bit and 32-bit applications
under OS/2 V2.0, the maximum size of the process address space has been
set at 512MB.  This means that all memory in the process address space can
be addressed using either the 16:16 or the 0:32 addressing scheme. This
capability is important since it allows applications to be composed of mixed
16-bit and 32-bit code, allows 32-bit applications to make function calls
to 16-bit service layers, and permits 16-bit applications written for OS/2
Version 1.x to run unmodified,<!-- entering slot 81 --> effectively allowing
a "hybrid" memory management environment.
<P>
The 32-bit flat memory model greatly simplifies the migration of 32-bit
applications to OS/2 Version 2.0 from other operating system platforms,
and the migration of OS/2 Version 2.0 applications to other platforms. This
is in contrast to the segmented memory model implemented by the 80286 processor.
All the features described above arise from the fact that a flat linear
memory model is used, taking advantage of the advanced features of the 80386
processor.  The paging scheme is more general than the segmentation scheme
used by the 80286, and the flat memory model will facilitate any future
migration of OS/2 to a hardware platform other than the Intel 80x86 family.
