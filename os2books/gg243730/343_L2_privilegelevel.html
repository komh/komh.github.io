In the context of the Intel 80386 processor architecture, the level of authority
at which a task executes.  There are four available privilege levels; under
OS/2 Version 2.0, Level 0 is used for operating system kernel code; Level
1 is not used; Level 2 is used for applications which directly address I/O
devices (such as communications applications); Level 3 is used for general
application code.
