<P>
In step 2, a general protection exception occurs when attempting to access
1200 integers for read/write.  Since each addressable memory location is
a double word (4 bytes), there are a maximum of 1024 addressable locations
in a single page.  Attempting to access 1200 integers resulted in a general
protection exception when the 1025th location was accessed.
<P>
Should the program have done a second<B> DosAllocMem</B>, the page following
the page containing the memory object used in the exercise would have also
been valid in the process address space.  The protection exception would
then not have been generated.  32-bit programs see the process address as
a single segment.
