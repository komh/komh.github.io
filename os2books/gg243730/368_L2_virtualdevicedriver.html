virtual device driver
<P>
Form of device driver used by DOS applications executing in a DOS virtual
machine, in order to access devices which must be shared with other processes
in the system, such as the screen or mouse.  The virtual device driver maps
DOS device commands to the normal (physical) device driver under OS/2 Version
2.0.
