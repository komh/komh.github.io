<H1>Disk Volume Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 154 -->
<P>
The maximum size for a disk volume under OS/2 Version 2.0 is 512GB using
HPFS and 2GB using the FAT file system, with the following conditions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->OS/2 V2.0 requires that the bootable partition
be within the 1023rd cylinder of the disk
<P>
When a machine's BIOS reports on the characteristics of a disk, it returns
three values; it determines the number of sectors per head, the number of
heads per cylinder, and the number of cylinders. The IBM BIOS sets the disk
geometry such that one cylinder equals one megabyte of disk storage.  For
IBM disk drives, 1023 cylinders corresponds to one gigabyte. Other manufacturers
may use different sector and head values causing the 1023 cylinder limit
to be greater than or less than one gigabyte.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A FAT file system volume must not exceed the
1023rd cylinder of the disk drive.
<P>
It may also not exceed 2GB even if, due to the manufacturer's disk geometry,
the 1023rd cylinder is beyond 2GB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Imagine a 10GB disk where the geometry of the disk has sector/head/cylinder
values such that the 1023rd cylinder corresponds to 7.4GB, as is the case
with some OEM SCSI disks.  Using the FAT file system, the way to configure
the volumes to maximize their size would be to have three volumes of 2GB
and one volume of 1.4GB.  In this case the 2.6GB of free space (beyond the
1023rd cylinder) would be unusable by OS/2 using the FAT file system.  These
volumes may exist in primary partitions or an extended partition, or both.
 In an extended partition, the volume would occupy one or more of the logical
partitions defined in the extended partition.
<P>
Although an HPFS volume can take up the entire disk, for performance reasons
the practical limit is much less than 512GB.
<P>
There are 24 drive letters available for hard disk drives (a: and b: are
reserved for diskette drives), and currently the largest tested IBM SCSI
hard disk available for the PS/2 is 400MB.  Using 24 single SCSI disks chained
on four SCSI adapters we would get a maximum of 24 x 400MB, or 9.6GB of
online DASD.
