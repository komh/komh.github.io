<P>
The user is presented with a <A HREF="020_L2_TheInitialSystemConf.html">panel
</A>which displays icons for mouse, keyboard, display, and country options,
along with the default setting for each.  These settings are determined
by the installation procedure by interrogating the installed hardware in
the system.  The user may elect to alter one or more of these settings by
selecting a check box next to each icon, and then selecting the<I> OK</I> pushbutton
on the <A HREF="020_L2_TheInitialSystemConf.html">dialog box</A>.
<P>
For each selected option, the installation procedure then displays a dialog
box which contains a list of the valid settings for that option.  This list
is displayed using a standard Presentation Manager list box.  The user selects
the required setting with the mouse or keyboard, and commits the choice
by selecting the<I> OK</I> pushbutton.
<P>
The default options selected by the installation procedure are as follows:
