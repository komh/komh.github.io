<P>
When memory objects are shared between processes in the 16-bit environment,
the processes may share either the linear address spaces or the actual physical
pages, depending upon the way in which the memory is shared.  The allocation
of shared memory by 16-bit applications using the<B> DosAllocShrSeg()</B> function
involves shared linear addresses, which are referenced by different LDT
entries in each 16-bit process.  This mapping of LDT entries to linear addresses
is shown in <A HREF="016_L2_1616SharedAddressRan.html">Figure "16:16 Shared
Address Ranges"</A>.
<P>
Memory objects are shared using the alias technique, whereby the different
16:16 memory references used by each application are mapped by the operating
system, using the tiled LDTs, to the same locations in memory. This is very
similar to the technique used for shared memory in a pure 0:32 environment.
