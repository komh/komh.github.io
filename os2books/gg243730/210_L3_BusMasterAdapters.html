<H1>Bus Master Adapters</H1><!-- entering slot 234 -->
<P>
The use of bus master adapters avoids the need for the system processor
to become involved in data transfers between adapters in the system. For
example, a bus master LAN adapter may interact with the disk subsystem to
service I/O requests on a LAN server, while the system processor continues
to process other work.
<P>
Bus master adapters provide advantages over other "intelligent" adapters
such as DMA adapters, since a bus master is typically directly involved
in the data transfer (as either source or destination) and thus requires
only a single operation to transfer the data, while a DMA adapter requires
two (one read and one write). In addition, the DMA controller used in current
IBM PS/2 system units is only capable of 24-bit addressing, while bus master
adapters, such as the SCSI adapters, utilize the full 32-bits available
on the address bus on the PS/2 models 90 and 95.
<P>
A bus master may randomly address memory and memory-mapped I/O devices.
This makes it ideal for paged environments and enables the bus master to
execute chains of work, addressing different memory areas and devices without
support from the system processor. The bus master adapter is regarded as
a subsystem and can work completely asynchronously to the system processor
and other bus masters. Where necessary a bus master may communicate directly
with another bus master.
