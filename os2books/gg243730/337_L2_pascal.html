pascal
<P>
Keyword used in C programming, which causes the compiler to generate object
code for a function or subroutine, such that parameters are placed on the
stack in left-to-right order, and the stack is cleared by the called routine
when control is passed from one routine to another.  Originally introduced
by Microsoft with early versions of Microsoft Windows, when this convention
saved several hundred bytes of system memory.  Contrast this with the <A HREF="272_L2_cdecl.html"><I>cdecl
</I></A>keyword.
