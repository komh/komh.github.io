<H1>Processing Page Faults</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
When a process attempts to access a page, for which the present bit in the
PTE is not set, a page fault occurs.  The page fault is passed to OS/2 Version
2.0's page fault handler, and the following sequence of events takes place:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A PF is allocated from the free list or the LRU
end of the idle list. Should the PF be taken from the idle list, and its
current contents be marked as "<I>dirty</I> ", it will be necessary to first
write the page to the swap file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Once the PF is available, its contents will be
loaded based on information contained in the VP.  The source could be one
of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the page is marked "<I>allocate on demand</I> ",
the physical memory manager will provide the page. If requested the page
is initialized to zeros.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the page is discardable, it is reloaded from an
executable file on disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the page is swappable but is currently on the idle
list, it can be reclaimed because it is still present in memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the page is swapped out, it is reloaded from the
swap file.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>  3.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>The
PTE is updated with the PF address and the present bit is set on.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
4.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>The TLB is flushed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>  5.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>The
program instruction that caused the exception is restarted.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
