<H1>Virtual 8086 Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 226 -->
<P>
The 80386 processor supports concurrent execution of one or more 8086 programs
within the protected mode environment.  There is no longer a need for the
processor to switch back to real mode in order to simulate an 8086 machine.

<P>
An 8086 program runs in protected mode as part of a<B> virtual 8086 task</B>.
 Virtual 8086 tasks are able to take advantage of the 80386 hardware support
for multitasking, offered in protected mode. Virtual 8086 tasks may execute
concurrently with one another and with other protected mode tasks in the
system.
<P>
The purpose of the virtual 8086 task is to form a <A HREF="370_L2_virtualDOSmachine.html"><B>virtual
machine</B></A> for running programs written for  the 8086 processor.  A
complete virtual machine consists of the 80386 processor support, plus additional
support from operating system software:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The hardware provides a set of virtual registers (implemented
through the TSS), a virtual memory space (the first 1MB of the 32-bit linear
address space) and directly executes all instructions that deal with these
registers and with this address space.
<P>
While running in virtual-8086 mode the processor does not treat the contents
of the segment as an index into a descriptor table, but the linear address
is formed in exactly in the same way as it is done by the 8086 processor.
 With paging, enabled the address is then mapped to a physical address by
the address translation hardware.  When paging is not being used, the linear
address is the physical address.  This means that when there is a requirement
for multiple virtual-8086 tasks, paging must enabled. <A HREF="038_L2_Virtual8086Environme.html">Figure
"Virtual 8086 Environment - Memory Management"</A> shows the way in which
the memory used by virtual 8086 machines is mapped into the system's physical
address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The operating system software controls the external
interfaces of the virtual machine (I/O, interrupts, and exceptions).  In
the case of I/O, the operating system can choose either to emulate I/O instructions
or to let the hardware execute them directly.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Virtual 8086 tasks execute at privilege level 3 (lowest) and are subject
to all of the protection checks defined in protected mode, thereby preventing
an ill-behaved application from accessing and potentially corrupting memory
used by other tasks in the system.
<P>
All I/O is normally handled through the I/O permission map in the 80386
TSS for both virtual 8086 applications and other protected mode applications.
 This means that any call to I/O services generates an exception which is
trapped by the 80386 and may then be handled by the operating system.  Any
unauthorized calls may be trapped within the operating system, thus preventing
an ill-behaved application from "hanging" the system.
<P>
In addition, the 80386 paging hardware allows virtual 8086 tasks to share
segments.
