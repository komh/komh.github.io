<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 allows a memory object to have any size between 1 byte
and 512MB, which is the maximum amount of memory addressable in a process
address space.  A program uses the<B> DosAllocMem()</B> and<B> DosAllocSharedMem()
</B>function calls to allocate memory objects. The use of these and other
available functions to manipulate memory objects is described in<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
<P>
Allocating a memory object with a size of 1 byte will in reality reserve
a full 4KB page, since the operating system allocates memory on a page-by-page
basis.  In order to avoid large amounts of wasted memory, an application,
which uses many small memory objects, should request the allocation of a
storage pool from the operating system, and then suballocate this storage
as required.  This technique reduces memory fragmentation and allows more
efficient use of memory resources.  It is described in detail in<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
<P>
When a memory object is allocated, its base address and maximum size are
defined. The location of the object and the size of the object is fixed
for the lifetime of the object.  It can be neither re-sized or moved within
the virtual address space. By default, however, no physical storage is reserved
for a memory object at allocation time; the operating system merely reserves
a range of addresses in the process address space for that object.  A memory
object which is allocated in this way is known as a <A HREF="356_L2_sparseobject.html"><B>sparse
object</B></A>.
<P>
Before an application can write to a memory object, the object must be<I> committed</I>;
upon commitment, physical storage is reserved for the memory object.  Storage
can be committed at either of two points:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The memory object may be committed in its entirety
at the time the object is allocated.  This method is typically used for
small memory objects, the size of which is fixed and predetermined prior
to execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The memory object or any part of it may be committed
after allocation, in 4KB (page) units.  This method is typically used for
memory objects such as documents or spreadsheets, which are likely to increase
in size during execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This effectively allows an application to increase the size of a memory
object in a series of steps, as the storage requirements for that object
increase during application execution. A memory object can therefore be
allocated at its maximum possible size during initialization, without imposing
large memory overheads on the system as a whole, since real storage is reserved
<I>only</I> as it is required.
<P>
Each page within the memory object can be individually committed, or a group
of pages may be committed at the same time, up to the maximum size of the
memory object stipulated during allocation.  Note that this is one of the
few instances where an application developer must be aware of the paged
memory architecture.
