<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability to support multiple operating systems
on the same machine, by providing an operating system independent boot utility
known as <A HREF="269_L2_BootManager.html"><B>Boot Manager</B></A>.
<P>
For example, OS/2 Version 2.0, DOS and AIX may be installed on the same
physical machine, using separate fixed disk partitions and/or disks as supported
by Boot Manager. When starting the machine, a user is presented with a panel
allowing selection of the required operating system.  The partition which
contains the desired operating system is then activated, and that operating
system is loaded and started.
