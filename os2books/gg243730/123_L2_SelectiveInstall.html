<P>
The graphical installation procedure provides for the reinstallation of
particular operating system features, and the subsequent installation of
required features which have not been installed during the initial installation
process.  This is achieved by allowing the graphical installation procedure
to run as a stand-alone process under Presentation Manager.
<P>
The graphical installation procedure may, therefore, be executed at any
time by choosing<I> Selective Install</I> from the<I> System Setup</I> option
in the<I> OS/2 System</I> folder.
