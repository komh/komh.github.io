<H1>Summary</H1><!-- entering slot 112 -->
<P>
The task management component of OS/2 Version 2.0 is greatly improved over
that implemented in previous versions of OS/2, while maintaining backward
compatibility for applications and resources written to previous versions.
Significant effort has been made to enhance performance and remove system
limitations experienced in previous versions.
<P>
The result of these efforts is summarized below:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->All 16-bit applications and resources may be used
in the OS/2 Version 2.0 environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->New 32-bit applications are able to exploit the benefits
of the 80386 processor.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The thread limitation of 53 threads per process is
removed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The thread limitation for the entire system is increased
from 512 to 4096 threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The process limitation for the entire system is increased
to 4095.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The operating system contains more swappable code,
thereby reducing its real memory requirements and allowing more storage
to be used by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These enhancements provide a greater diversity of function for the application
developer, allowing more sophisticated applications to be written and executed
under OS/2 Version 2.0 using multiple threads and processes, while reducing
the effort required to synchronize and communicate between threads and processes.

<P>
Threads may be more easily created, controlled and terminated under OS/2
Version 2.0 than under previous versions of OS/2, thereby reducing the effort
required to generate high-function, multithreaded applications which fully
exploit the OS/2 Version 2.0 platform.
<P>
Improved efficiency in module loading and execution results in enhanced
application performance.  Improved mechanisms for resolution of semaphore
contention allow improved dispatching and thereby reduce overhead, further
enhancing overall performance.
