<H1>Sharing Partitions between Operating Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 187 -->
<P>
Boot Manager allows for both primary and extended partitions on a single
physical drive.  Only one primary partition may be active at a time.  However,
the extended partition will always be active, regardless of which primary
partition is active.  Logical drives in an extended partition may therefore
be accessed by multiple operating systems started from primary partitions
or from logical drives in the extended partition.  This access is dependent
on the operating system supporting the format of the extended partition.

<P>
<A HREF="054_L2_PartitionFormatAcces.html">Table "Partition Format Accessibility"
</A>illustrates some of the dependencies between operating systems and extended
partitions.
<P>
Note that it is not possible for an operating system loaded from a primary
partition to access any other primary partition on that hardfile;  only
the logical drive on the operating system's own primary partition and those
on extended partitions may be accessed.
<P>
Where it is desirable to have a common set of application or data files
which may be accessed by different operating systems, a workable strategy
is to locate<I> only</I> those files which are specific to the operating
system on the appropriate primary partition, while locating common application
and data files on logical drives in extended partitions.  This implies that
the primary partitions should be created to be comfortably large enough
to accommodate the desired configuration of the operating system concerned,
but no larger.
<P>
Since the amount of disk space required to configure any operating system
to meet particular needs will vary widely with those needs, readers should
consult the installation and configuration instructions for the operating
system concerned, in order to determine a reasonable partition size.
<P>
When setting up a complex set of operating systems and extended partitions,
readers should carefully consider the implications of logical drive letters
that each operating system will automatically assign to all logical drives
visible to the operating system.  This especially applies to applications
which reference other applications or data located on different logical
drives.  The logical drive letters may not be consistent between operating
systems; for example, a logical partition formatted for HPFS will be completely
invisible to DOS 3.3, but visible though not accessible to DOS 4.0 (CSD
UR31300).  This may result in different logical drive letters being assigned
to other logical drives, depending upon which operating system is currently
active in the machine, which in turn holds implications for the configuration
of applications and the design of batch files.
