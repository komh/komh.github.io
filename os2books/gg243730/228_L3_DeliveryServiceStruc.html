<H1>Delivery Service Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 252 -->
<P>
The SCB architecture defines a structure that supports the physical delivery
of control information between multiple entities (requesting or serving
functions) executing in a base system processor and one or more peer entities
executing in an advanced function adapters. Some entities may act as clients
(requesters) while others act as servers. The entities build the control
block structure, and the<I> control block delivery service</I> is used by
one entity in either a system unit or feature adapter to communicate control
block information to another entity.
<P>
Based upon the information within a control block, data may also be communicated
between the two entities. The communication of data is referred to as<I> data
delivery</I>. The delivery of data is separate from the delivery of command
and control information and the individual entities are responsible for
requesting the transfer of the data.
<P>
In the simplest case, the control block delivery service may be viewed as
supporting communication between client entities located in the system unit
and server entities located in an adapter.
