<H1>Understanding the System Parameters</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
The installation of OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the user with a chance to
tailor the OS/2 and DOS system parameters from the<I> OS/2 Setup and Installation
</I>panel. During normal operation of OS/2 V2.0 there is little need to
directly edit system files such as CONFIG.SYS. The installation of OS/2
generates a CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory of the installation drive,
similar to that shown in <A HREF="025_L2_ATypicalOS2Version20.html">Figure
"A Typical OS/2 Version 2.0 CONFIG.SYS"</A>.  Note that in this example
the user has installed OS/2 V2.0 on the "D:" logical drive.
<P>
The CONFIG.SYS files for OS/2 V2.0  are similar to those in previous versions
of OS/2 with a few exceptions.  Here is a brief explanation of the function
performed by each line in the CONFIG.SYS used as an example above.  A full
description of each of the statements used can be found in the<I> Online
Command Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<PRE>01   IFS=D:\OS2\HPFS.IFS  /CACHE:384 /CRECL:4 /AUTOCHECK:CDEFG

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This line installs the High Performance File System
(HPFS) driver.  Installable File System (IFS) drivers load code to manage
disks and other storage media with file systems other than FAT (File Allocation
Table).
<P>
The /CACHE parameter specifies the amount of memory (KB) that the HPFS file
system driver will use for file system disk caching.  The cache for the
FAT file system is handled by the DISKCACHE= statement, line 22 in this
example. The amount of cache specified in the CONFIG.SYS can have a significant
impact on performance.  The OS/2 V2.0 installation process will select an
amount of cache for the system based on the amount of installed memory,
the disk size and the file system being used. The optimum amount of cache
to use will depend on the factors just mentioned, and the mix of operations
performed by the system.  For example, an I/O intensive system, such as
a server, may perform better with a larger cache.
<P>
The /CRECL parameter specifies the maximum record size (in multiples of
2KB) for caching.  This value is also important for performance as it represents
the maximum size an I/O can be, and still be read into the HPFS cache.
<P>
For more information on the parameters associated with the HPFS driver,
refer to the<I> Online Command Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>These lines set OS/2 V2.0<I> system variables</I> stored
in the OS/2 V2.0<I><!-- entering slot 130 --> environment</I>.  The environment
is a special place in storage used by the operating system and applications
to store and look up values of variables. DOS sessions and OS/2 sessions
operate independently; therefore each command processor that starts a session
can have its own environment.  For information on how command processors
within a session inherit the environment, refer to the<I> Online Command
Reference</I>.
<P>
The main change from OS/2 V1.3 is the inclusion of some variables used by
the Workplace Shell, namely lines 3 though 7.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>09   LIBPATH=.;D:\OS2\DLL;D:\OS2\MDOS;D:\;D:\OS2\APPS\DLL;

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This sets the LIBPATH variable.  It is used to
identify a set of directories to be searched when OS/2 loads dynamic link
libraries.  LIBPATH is not a part of the environment and therefore cannot
be viewed with the SET command.  Also, unlike the PATH environment variable,
the current directory is not searched first.  The entry " .; " at the beginning
of the LIBPATH statement is used to force OS/2 V2.0 to search the current
directory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>15   PRIORITY_DISK_IO=YES

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Specifies disk input/output priority for applications
running in the foreground.  When PRIORITY_DISK_IO=YES is specified, applications
running in the foreground will receive disk I/O priority over applications
running in the background.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>16   FILES=20

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Determines the maximum number of files available
in DOS sessions. Regardless of the FILES= setting, all DOS programs are
initialized to a maximum of 20 files.  It is the responsibility of an application
to increase the number of files<I> up to the maximum</I> set by the FILES=
statement.  Each DOS session can also be customized by changing the appropriate
DOS setting.  This statement has no effect in OS/2 sessions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>17   DEVICE=D:\OS2\TESTCFG.SYS
18   DEVICE=D:\OS2\DOS.SYS
19   DEVICE=D:\OS2\PMDD.SYS

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Install device drivers using the DEVICE= statement.
 Both DOS and OS/2 device drivers can be loaded with this statement in the
CONFIG.SYS.  OS/2 V2.0 device drivers are initialized when you start OS/2
and can process requests from either DOS or OS/2 programs. DOS device drivers
are also initialized when you start the OS/2 operating system but they can
only process requests from DOS programs.
<P>
TESTCFG.SYS is a new device driver in OS/2 V2.0 which is used during the
install process to test the system configuration.  This DEVICE statement
should not be removed from the CONFIG.SYS as it is also used by the selective
install process and during device driver installation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>20   BUFFERS=30

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Sets the number of disk buffers the system will
keep in memory. Each buffer uses 512 bytes of available memory.  If you
run many programs in OS/2 sessions, you can increase the speed of your system
by increasing the value specified for BUFFERS (for example, BUFFERS=70).
 However, remember that when you increase the number of disk buffers, you
decrease the available memory by 512 bytes for each buffer specified.  In
memory-constrained systems (4MB) reduce the number of buffers to 20.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>21   IOPL=YES

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Allows I/O privilege to be granted to requesting
processes in OS/2 sessions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>22   DISKCACHE=64,LW

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Specifies the number of blocks of storage (KB)
allocated to the FAT file system cache.  This<!-- entering slot 131 --> parameter
can have a marked effect on performance.  See the comments on line 01 of
this example CONFIG.SYS and also the<I> Online Command Reference</I> for
more information on the parameters associated with DISKCACHE.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>23   MAXWAIT=3

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Sets the length of time, in seconds, a process
waits before the system assigns it a higher priority.  The most appropriate
length of time to set MAXWAIT to depends on the number of applications that
must run concurrently and the kinds of activities the applications perform.
 The default is 3 seconds.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>24   MEMMAN=SWAP,PROTECT

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This line specifies the various memory management
options for the OS/2 V2.0  environment.  SWAP enables paging whereas NOSWAP
disables paging.  PROTECT enables the use of protected memory by DLLs. There
is also the MOVE/NOMOVE parameter which has no effect under OS/2 V2.0 and
is provided for compatibility with OS/2 V1.3 only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>25   SWAPPATH=D:\OS2\SYSTEM 2048 4096

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>The swap file (SWAPPER.DAT) is used to temporarily
store pages that the system has removed from physical memory in order to
free up space to satisfy page-in requests generated as a result of page
faults. If paging is enabled, this command specifies the location and initial
size of the swap file.  The first parameter specifies the amount of disk
space (in KB) at which the system will begin to warn you that there is less
than this amount of space left on the partition containing your SWAPPER.DAT
file.  The second parameter specifies the size of the swapper file (in KB)
initially allocated at the time OS/2 is started.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>26   BREAK=OFF

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>The Ctrl-Break keys sequence will stop a command
from completing its task.  The BREAK parameter instructs the system to check
if you pressed Ctrl-Break before the system carries out a program request.
 BREAK=ON could decrease overall performance, but means the operating system
will probably intercept Ctrl-Break faster.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>27   THREADS=256

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This specifies the maximum number of threads available
to OS/2 V2.0 and its applications.  The maximum that can be specified here
is 4095.  Normally the system default of 256 is sufficient.  In memory-constrained
systems (4MB) reduce this to 128.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>28   PRINTMONBUFSIZE=134,134,134

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This sets the parallel-port device-driver buffer
size.  Each number corresponds to the buffer size for LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3
respectively.  The minimum value that can be specified is 134 bytes and
the maximum is 2048 bytes.  The system will default to 134 bytes if PRINTMONBUFSIZE
is not specified or is out of this range.  Changing these values will allow
you to increase the size of the parallel-port device-driver buffers and
thereby increase performance of data transfer to devices connected to the
parallel ports.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE><!-- entering slot 132 -->29   COUNTRY=001,D:\OS2\SYSTEM\COUNTRY.SYS

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>This specifies the country code and the file containing
the country information used.  This information is selected by the user
at installation.  Refer to the<I> Online Command Reference</I> for more
details and information on code-page switching.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<PRE>30   SET KEYS=ON

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>The DELDIR environment variable is new with OS/2
V2.0  and is used by the UNDELETE command.  DELDIR specifies a path used
to store files that have been DELETED or ERASED.  A separate directory and
maximum directory size must be specified for each logical disk. Installation
will add an appropriate DELDIR statement to the CONFIG.SYS but remarks it
out.  To enable UNDELETE, remove the 'REM' from the beginning of this line.

<UL>These lines install base device drivers for the
following:
<BR>
PRINT02.SYS; Device support for locally attached printers on Micro Channel
workstations.
<BR>
IBM2FLPY.ADD; Device support for diskette drives on Micro Channel workstations.

<BR>
IBM2SCSI.ADD; Device support for Micro Channel SCSI adapters. The /LED parameter
is only applicable when running on a PS/2 Model 95 and if present, the device
driver will use the system information display panel to simulate a disk
activity light.
<BR>
OS2SCSI.DMD; General-purpose device support for non-disk SCSI devices.
<BR>
OS2DASD.DMD; General-purpose device support for disk drives.
<P>
In addition, OS/2 V2.0 includes the following base device drivers:
<BR>
PRINT01.SYS; Device support for locally attached printers on non-Micro Channel
workstations.
<BR>
IBM1FLPY.ADD; Device support for diskette drives on non-Micro Channel workstations.

<BR>
IBM1S506.ADD; Device support for non-SCSI disk drives on non-Micro Channel
workstations.
<BR>
IBM2ADSK.ADD; Device support for non-SCSI disk drives on Micro Channel workstations.

<BR>
IBMINT13.I13; General-purpose device support for non-Micro Channel SCSI
adapters.
<P>
A device driver is a file that contains the code that the OS/2 operating
system needs to recognize a device and correctly process information received
from or sent to that device.  A base device driver is one that is needed
when the OS/2 operating system is first started.
<P>
The BASEDEV statement is used to load base device drivers. Device support
for disks, diskettes, printers connected to the workstation, and other devices,
is loaded with the BASEDEV statement.
<P>
Unlike the DEVICE statement, the BASEDEV statement cannot contain either
drive or path information because the OS/2 operating system cannot process
such information at the stage of the startup sequence when the BASEDEV statements
are processed. The root directory of the startup partition is first searched
for the specified file name, then the \OS2 directory of the startup partition.
 If drive or path information is included in a BASEDEV statement, an error
is generated.
<P>
In addition, BASEDEV statements are not necessarily processed in the order
in which they appear in your CONFIG.SYS file.  The extensions of the file
names specified in the BASEDEV statements are examined; the statements are
then processed in the following order of file name extensions:  .SYS .BID
.VSD .TSD .ADD .I13 .FLT then .DMD<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>The SASYNCDx.SYS device driver loads the asynchronous
communications device interface (ACDI) support for the PM terminal program.
 If the PM Terminal program was not installed, this line may be REMarked
out.  If this is the case, delete "REM" from the beginning of the line to
enable ACDI support.  Remember, after changes are made to the CONFIG.SYS
the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to come into effect. Refer

<UL>The SHELL= line specifies the DOS command processor
(COMMAND.COM), or allows you to replace the DOS command processor with another
command processor.  In this example we are loading and starting the DOS
COMMAND.COM processor.  The parameters following it are specific to the
command processor.  In this case the parameters are the path for COMMAND.COM

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Lines 44 through 53 are needed to configure and
load drivers for the DOS environment.
<P>
The first line sets the file control block (FCB) management information
for DOS sessions.  A FCB is a record that contains all of the information
about a file (for example, its structure, length, and name).  If a program
tries to open more than the number of files specified in the FCBS statement,
the system closes the least recently used file control block and opens the
new file.  This parameter should not need to be changed and has no effect
on OS/2 sessions.
<P>
The RMSIZE= statement specifies the highest storage address allowed for
the DOS operating environment.  In certain circumstances this<!-- entering slot 134 --> can
be used to limit the size of the DOS environment.
<P>
In line 48, the DOS= parameter specifies whether the DOS kernel will reside
in the high memory area (HMA) and whether the operating system or DOS applications
will control upper memory blocks (UMBs).  The HMA refers to space between
1MB and 1MB+64KB and UMBs reside between 640KB and 1MB.
<P>
If DOS=HIGH/LOW,UMB is specified in CONFIG.SYS, then the operating system
controls the UMBs.  This means that DOS applications can be loaded into
upper memory but cannot allocate UMBs.
<P>
On the other hand, if DOS=HIGH/LOW,NOUMB is specified in CONFIG.SYS, then
the operating system will not control any UMBs and DOS applications can
allocate UMBs but cannot be loaded there.
<P>
Lines 46 and 47, and 49 through 53 contain the device drivers for the virtual
DOS/Windows environment.  More information on these specific drivers and
a complete discussion of tailoring the DOS environment under OS/2 V2.0 may
be found in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:  DOS and Windows Environment</I>.

<UL>These lines configure the display environment under
OS/2 V2.0
<P>
The DEVINFO= statement in line 54 is used to prepare a device (such as a
keyboard (KBD), display terminal (SCR), or printer (LPT#)) for codepage
switching.  Separate DEVINFO statements are required for each device to
be used for codepage switching.
<P>
This line prepares the display screen for codepage switching. The display
statement specifies your display name and a file named VIOTBL.DCP that contains
a video font table for displaying characters in each of the codepages supported
by the system.

Lines 55 and 56 set environment variables related to the display driver
being used.
<P>
Lines 57 and 58 load virtual device drivers for the VGA and 8514/A devices,
for use by the DOS/Windows environment.  In this example, the user specified
VGA resolution with an 8514/A adapter installed.
<P>
If OS/2 V2.0 were installed on a system with an XGA adapter, and high resolution
was specified for the Windows environment (that is, Windows was to be run
full-screen only), then the appropriate lines in the CONFIG.SYS would be:

<PRE>        DEVINFO=SCR,VGA,D:\OS2\VIOTBL.DCP

<UL>The COM.SYS device driver supports ports COM1,
COM2, COM3, and COM4. It does not provide support for specific devices that
are attached to the COM port.  Instead, it provides enabling support for
the asynchronous communications interface itself. Application programs,
subsystems, and system programs must provide the support needed to use devices
attached to the COM port.  VCOM.SYS is a virtual device driver that provides
support in DOS sessions for up to four COM ports.
