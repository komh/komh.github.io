Disk Operating System; generally used in reference to IBM PC DOS, the single-tasking
16-bit real-mode operating system designed for Intel 8086 processors, and
developed by Microsoft Corporation as MS DOS in the early 1980s.  IBM subsequently
licensed MS DOS for use on IBM Personal Computer and Personal System/2 machines,
and has since undertaken joint development of later versions of the operating
system in conjunction with Microsoft.
