<P>
While OS/2 Version 2.0 is a 32-bit operating system, its device drivers
and Device Helper (DevHlp) functions remain 16-bit.  OS/2 V1.3 device drivers
are generally compatible with OS/2 V2.0.  New in OS/2 V2.0 is a layered
device driver architecture.  Also new are virtual device drivers for use
by programs running in virtual DOS machine.
