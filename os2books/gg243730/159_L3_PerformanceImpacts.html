<P>
The path length added to the overall system startup time path consists solely
of the instructions contained in the MBB.  The OS/2 Version 2.0 MBB is approximately
16KB in size, with about 50% being instructions and the remaining 50% being
data and space for the boot table and error messages. Tests have shown no
measurable increase in overall startup time, counting the time from POST
exit to display of the selection menu, plus the time from the selection
being entered to the appearance of the first OS/2 or DOS operating system
message on the screen.  Based on these tests, the impact of Boot Manager
during boot time is considered negligible.
<P>
The MBB is loaded into memory during startup, and is later overwritten by
the operating system boot record loaded from the logical drive from which
the system is IPLed.  Thus, no memory impact is realized when using Boot
Manager. Memory requirements for the various operating systems participating
in a Boot Manager environment do not change.
