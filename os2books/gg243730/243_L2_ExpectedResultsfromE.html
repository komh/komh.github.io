After successfully completing the exercise, you will see the following results:

<P>
The behavior seen in cases 1, 2 and 3 occurs because the 80386 processor
does not distinguish between READ and EXECUTE access.  Furthermore, READ
or EXECUTE access is allowed even for memory objects specified with WRITE
access.  This is because WRITE access implies both READ and EXECUTE access.
 However, WRITE access<I> must</I> be specified in order for the application
to write into a memory object.
<P>
In case 4, because the guard page bit is set, a guard page fault will always
occur when accessing the page.  You also should have seen a second message,
"<I>Exception occurred handling a prior exception</I> ". This occurs when
the default guard page exception handler is invoked and tries to treat the
area as a stack.
<P>
In case 5, because the memory allocated was not committed, no physical space
was reserved. Whenever accessing any of this memory a general protection
exception is always raised.
