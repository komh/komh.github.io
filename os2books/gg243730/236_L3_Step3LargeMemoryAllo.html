<H1>Step 3 - Large Memory Allocation</H1><!-- entering slot 262 -->
<P>
Execute the program MEMLAB1.EXE, and instruct the program to perform the
following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Allocate 1048576 integers (4MB).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Use 67584 integers (254KB) for read/write.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Note:  </B> This will take some time to complete. Please be patient.

<P>
Check the program code to see how the memory allocation is done.  Explain
why this method works for all sizes of memory allocation.  Compare this
to the OS/2 V 1.x memory allocation scheme.
<P>
<B>If you are able to do the exercise </B> Please do so now. If not, refer
to the following explanation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
If the program does not work, check for the free disk size on the logical
drive where the SWAPPER.DAT file is located.  Erase excess files and rerun
the program.  Contact your instructor for further assistance.
