<H1>32-Bit Programming Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 67 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a 32-bit programming interface, providing enhanced
performance through use of the 80386 instruction set, and allowing applications
to take full advantage of the 32-bit flat memory model.  Since the application
developer is no longer concerned with the details of manipulating segments,
this simplifies the task of memory management within an application, particularly
where large memory objects are used.  The lack of a segmented memory model
also facilitates porting of applications between OS/2 Version 2.0 and other
32-bit environments.
<P>
The 32-bit environment also provides performance improvements since applications
have access to 32-bit processor instructions and 32-bit arithmetic.  The
flat memory model eliminates pointer arithmetic and segment register reloading,
which further improves overall performance.
<P>
The lack of segmentation also makes program compilation much simpler, since
the compiler (and hence the programmer) need no longer be concerned with
calling sequences and <A HREF="289_L2_far.html"><I>far</I></A> versus <A HREF="324_L2_near.html"><I>near
</I></A>memory references.  Only when creating mixed model programs (see
<A HREF="066_L2_16BitApplicationComp.html">16-Bit Application Compatibility</A>)
does segmentation become an issue.
<P>
Operations such as stack allocation for threads are also simplified in the
32-bit environment.  Additional capabilities have been built into the operating
system functions, removing the need for the application developer to explicitly
perform these functions within the application code. This allows easier
exploitation of the multithreading capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also provides application-transparent emulation of numeric
coprocessor functions.  If a coprocessor instruction is issued by an application
in a machine with no coprocessor installed, the operating system traps the
resulting exception condition and emulates the coprocessor instruction,
returning the result to the application.  Emulation is performed on a per-thread
basis, thereby preventing interference between instructions from different
threads or processes.  All applications developed for Version 2.0 may therefore
be compiled with in-line coprocessor instructions, removing the need for
conditional testing or coprocessor emulation within the application itself.

<P>
Programming for the 32-bit environment is described in more detail in<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
