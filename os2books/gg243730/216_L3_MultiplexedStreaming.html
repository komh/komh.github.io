<H1>Multiplexed Streaming Data Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 240 -->
<P>
When the Micro Channel is running in streaming data mode, the 32 address
lines are only used during the first cycle of the transfer. These address
lines are therefore available for transfer of an additional four bytes during
each following cycle. This mode is called <A HREF="322_L2_multiplexedstreaming.html"><B>multiplexed
streaming data mode</B></A> and gives an effective width of 64 bits (8 bytes)
for each cycle. The resulting effective data rate is 80MB per second. This
is shown in <A HREF="042_L2_MultiplexedStreaming.html">Figure "Multiplexed
Streaming Data Mode"</A>.
<P>
IBM has also disclosed that upcoming generations of Micro Channel systems
may implement a faster basic transfer cycle of 100 ns rather than the current
200 ns. With the current cycle the Micro Channel is able to transfer<I> sequential
blocks</I> of data with transfer rates of 20, 40, and 80MB per second. Systems
implementing the faster transfer cycle would be able to reach transfer speeds
of up to 160MB per second. These rates are essential for advanced function
bus masters, which must move large blocks of sequential data.
