<H1>Memory Management</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
Memory management is the way in which the operating system allows applications
to access the system's memory.  This includes the way in which memory is
allocated, either to a single application or to be shared by multiple applications.
The operating system must check how much memory is available to an application,
and handle the situation where there is no longer any real memory left to
satisfy an application's requests.
<P>
In OS/2 Version 2.0, memory management has been enhanced to provide a <A HREF="291_L2_flatmemorymodel.html"><B>flat
memory model</B></A>, which takes advantage of the 32-bit addressing scheme
provided by the Intel 80386 architecture.  This means that through memory
management, the system's memory is seen as one large linear address space
of 4GB. Applications have access to memory by requesting the allocation
of <A HREF="319_L2_memoryobject.html"><B>memory objects</B></A>. Under OS/2
Version 2.0, these memory objects can be of any size between 1 byte and
512MB.  The use of a flat memory model removes the need for application
developers to directly manipulate segments, and thereby removes a significant
obstacle in porting applications between OS/2 Version 2.0 and other 32-bit
environments such as AIX*.  Application performance is also improved when
manipulating memory, since the use of a linear address space eliminates
pointer arithmetic and segment register loads.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 manages memory internally using <A HREF="327_L2_page.html"><B>pages</B></A>,
each of which is 4KB in size.  Each memory object is regarded by the operating
system as a set of one or more pages.  For practical purposes therefore,
memory is allocated in units of 4KB, although a page may be broken down
into smaller parts and may contain multiple memory objects.
<P>
One of the useful aspects of paged memory is the way in which memory overcommitment
is handled, that is, what happens when there is no more real memory left
to load applications.  Under OS/2 Version 2.0, individual pages may be swapped
to and from disk, rather than entire memory objects. This technique improves
swapping performance, particularly when large memory objects exist in the
system. The fixed page size also improves swapping performance since the
operating system need not be concerned with moving objects in memory to
accommodate the various object sizes, as was the case with previous versions
of OS/2.
