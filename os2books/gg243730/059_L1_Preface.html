<P>
This document is intended to provide readers with an understanding of the
functions provided by the Control Program component in OS/2 Version 2.0
and its implementation. The document should enable readers to make an evaluation
of the OS/2 Version 2.0 product and its components.
<P>
The document contains information on the implementation of operating system
functions such as task management, memory management, and the 32-bit application
programming interfaces provided by OS/2 Version 2.0. Information is also
provided on hardware support and interrupt management, application debugging
aids within the operating system, and the support for multiple bootable
fixed disk partitions.  The document also discusses pre-installation planning
considerations, and the migration of existing applications from 16-bit versions
of OS/2 to OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
This document is intended for:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Planners and technical support personnel who require
an understanding of the internal function implementation in OS/2 Version
2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Programmers who wish to develop applications which
use the 32-bit application programming interfaces and extended flat memory
model provided under OS/2 Version 2.0, and/or wish to migrate applications
from previous versions of OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The code examples used in this document are available in electronic form
via CompuServe** or through a local IBM Support BBS, as package RB3730.ZIP.
IBM employees may obtain the code examples from the GG243730 PACKAGE on
OS2TOOLS.
<P>
<B>The document is organized as follows:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="061_L1_Overview.html">Overview</A></I> provides
a brief introduction to the topics covered in this document.
<P>
This chapter is recommended for all readers of the document.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="074_L1_MemoryManagement.html">Memory Management
</A></I>describes the memory management under OS/2 Version 2.0, including
the implementation of the 32-bit flat memory model and memory paging.  The
chapter also describes the allocation and protection of memory objects,
and support for 16-bit applications under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
This chapter is recommended for those readers who require an understanding
of the way in which OS/2 Version 2.0 manages the allocation of real and
virtual memory, and the way in which this implementation differs from that
in previous versions of OS/2.  Those readers who require a knowledge of
the hardware implementation of these components may also read <A HREF="187_L1_Intel80386Architectu.html">Intel
80386 Architecture</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="093_L1_TaskManagement.html">Task Management
</A></I>describes the task management, dispatching implementation and interrupt
handling under OS/2 Version 2.0.  Process synchronization through the use
of semaphores is also discussed.
<P>
This chapter is recommended for those readers who are concerned with the
implementation of multitasking under OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="105_L1_DebuggingSupport.html">Debugging
Support</A></I> describes the built-in application trace and debugging aids
provided as part of OS/2 Version 2.0, which enable debugger and trace applications
to provide additional information.
<P>
This chapter is recommended for those readers who desire an understanding
of these capabilities, or who may wish to design their own trace and/or
debug applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="110_L1_InstallationConsider.html">Installation
Considerations</A></I> discusses pre-installation planning and installation
considerations to be borne in mind when installing OS/2 Version 2.0, particularly
when installing it over existing versions of OS/2.  Hardware, memory, and
fixed disk space requirements are also described.
<P>
This chapter is intended primarily for planners who will be developing implementation
schemes for OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="128_L1_HardwareConsideratio.html">Hardware
Considerations</A></I> discusses the OS/2 Version 2.0 device driver structure,
changes in the OS/2 V2.0 file system handlers and other topics related to
hardware support.
<P>
This chapter is recommended for those readers who require information about
OS/2 V2.0 support for IBM and OEM personal computers and related hardware,
such as disk subsystems.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I><A HREF="152_L1_BootManager.html">Boot Manager
</A></I>describes the capability for multiple bootable fixed disk partitions,
which is supported by OS/2 Version 2.0.  This support enables different
operating systems to be installed on different disk partitions within the
same machine, and for the active partition to be switched in order to boot
the machine with an alternative operating system.
<P>
This chapter is intended for those planners who may wish to have multiple
operating systems installed on machines in their enterprise.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
