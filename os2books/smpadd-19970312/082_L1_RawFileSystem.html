<H1>Raw File System</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
The OS/2 Raw File System provides an interface for applications to efficiently
manage data on the logical partitions or physical hard drives installed
in a system.  Some of the Raw File System function is available by using
a combination of the <A HREF="137_L2_DosPhysicalDisk.html">DosPhysicalDisk
</A>and <A HREF="093_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl</A> functions.  However,
the Raw File System provides a significant step forward in usability and
performance.
<P>
The Raw File System provides a programming abstraction that treats each
logical partition or physical disk as one large file that can be opened,
locked, seeked, read from, written to, and closed.
<P>
Logical partitions are identified using the Universal Naming Convention
(UNC) in the form of
<PRE>\\.\X:
</PRE>

<P>
where<B> X</B> can be substituted with the letter corresponding the logical
partition desired on any hard drive, floppy disk or CD-ROM drive.
<P>
Physical disks are identified using a UNC name in the form of
<PRE>\\.\Physical_Disk#
</PRE>

<P>
where<B> #</B>  is replaced with the physical disk number corresponding
to the number found in the FDISK utility.  The Raw File System recognizes
up to 128 physical disks, thus eliminating the limit of 26 drives in previous
versions of OS/2.
<P>
The use of the universal naming convention coupled with the ability to access
any physical or logical drive using the common file system functions in
OS/2, provides a greatly simplified migration path for applications.
<P>
Traditionally, raw file systems have been utilized by applications that
manage large amounts of data under heavy workloads.  Typically, this has
been commercial database servers performing on-line transaction processing.
 Disk I/O can become a bottleneck under these conditions and the use of
an efficient raw file system can be very useful in improving system performance,
through reduced path length and serialization.  The chapter describes the
Raw File System functions in detail.
