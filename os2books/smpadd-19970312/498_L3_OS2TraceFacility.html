<H1>OS/2 Trace Facility</H1><!-- entering slot 513 -->
<P>
The OS/2 Trace facility is an important RAS mechanism in the OS/2 product.
 It allows specific events within the operating system, in system extensions,
and in applications to be recorded in a circular System Trace buffer.  Software
developers can create tracepoints that are used to monitor the execution
of software modules.
<P>
The OS/2 Trace facility includes two important utility programs.  The OS/2
Trace control utility, TRACE.EXE, is used to enable and disable the tracing
of events.  Entries within the System Trace buffer can be formatted for
viewing by using the OS/2 Trace Formatter utility, TRACEFMT.EXE.  The Trace
Formatter can also be used to copy the contents of the System Trace buffer
to disk for processing on another system.
<P>
The general categories of events that are traced in OS/2 are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->External application program interfaces (APIs)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Internal interfaces<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Other internal events.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For an interface or event, there are generally two tracepoints.  A pre-invocation
trace and a post-invocation trace.  One can determine the action taken by
the system for a particular event by matching the two corresponding trace
events in the trace output.
<P>
For more information on the OS/2 Trace facility, refer to the<I> OS/2 Command
Reference</I> and the<I> OS/2 Warp System Trace Facility</I> online books.
 (The latter book is shipped as part of OS/2 Warp Version 4.  It may or
may not be part of the OS/2 Warp Server for SMP online documentation.)
