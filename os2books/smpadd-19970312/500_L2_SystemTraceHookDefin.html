<P>
The following sections outline the trace hook major and minor codes for
various functions in OS/2.  The information in these tables is subject to
change as new hooks are added and obsolete ones are removed.  The mention
of a hook for a specific function does not necessarily mean that the hook
actually records data in the current version of OS/2.
<P>
Major codes of 0xb8 and 0xb9 have been reserved for use by customers for
trace hooks.
<P>
It is the intent of IBM to document the format of the trace data associated
with each implemented trace hook in OS/2 in the future.
<P>
