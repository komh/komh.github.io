<H1>Using the Debug Session Control Window</H1><!-- entering slot 323 -->
<P>
The Debug Session Control window is the control window of the debugger and
displays during the entire debugging session. This window is divided into
two panes. One pane shows the threads for the program you are debugging
and the corresponding process IDs, process names, kernel thread IDs, and
processor number (when applicable). The other pane shows the components
for the program that you are debugging.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="309_L3_UsingtheDebugSession_25.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=341 ALIGN=center><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
