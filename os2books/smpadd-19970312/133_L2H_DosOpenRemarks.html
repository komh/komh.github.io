<P>
A successful DosOpen request returns a handle for accessing the file or
device. The read/write pointer is set at the first byte of the file. The
position of the pointer can be changed with <A HREF="162_L2_DosSetFilePtr.html">DosSetFilePtr
</A>or by read and write operations on the file or device.
<P>
A file's date and time can be queried with DosQueryFileInfo. They are set
with DosSetFileInfo.
<P>
The read-only attribute of a file can be set with the ATTRIB command.
<P>
<I>ulAttribute</I> cannot be set to Volume Label. To set volume-label information,
issue DosSetFSInfo with a logical drive number. Volume labels cannot be
opened.
<P>
<I>cbFile</I> affects the size of the file only when the file is new or
a is replacement. If an existing file is opened,<I> cbFile</I> is ignored.
To change the size of the existing file, issue DosSetFileSize.
<P>
The value in<I> cbFile</I> is a recommended size. If the full size cannot
be allocated, the open request may still succeed. The file system makes
a reasonable attempt to allocate the new size in an area that is as nearly
contiguous as possible on the medium. When the file size is extended, the
values of the new bytes are undefined.
<P>
The Direct Open bit provides direct access to an entire disk or diskette
volume.  It is not used with the raw file system. This mode of opening the
volume that is currently on the drive returns a handle to the calling function;
the handle represents the logical volume as a single file.  The calling
function specifies this handle with a <A HREF="093_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>Category 8, <A HREF="958_L3_DSK_LOCKDRIVE00hLock.html">DSK_LOCKDRIVE
</A>request to prevent other processes from accessing the logical volume.
When you are finished using the logical volume, issue a <A HREF="093_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>Category 8, <A HREF="966_L3_DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE01hUn.html">DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE
</A>request to allow other processes to access the logical volume.
<P>
The file-handle state bits can be set by DosOpen and DosSetFHState. An application
can query the file-handle state bits, as well as the rest of the Open Mode
field, by issuing DosQueryFHState.
<P>
You can use an <A HREF="634_L2_EAOP2.html">EAOP2</A> structure to set extended
attributes in<I> peaop2</I> when creating a file, replacing an existing
file, or truncating an existing file. No extended attributes are set when
an existing file is just opened.
<P>
A replacement operation is logically equivalent to atomically deleting and
re-creating the file. This means that any extended attributes associated
with the file also are deleted before the file is re-created.
<P>
When using the raw file system to access logical partitions and disk locking
is required, use the following logic:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Lock the disk by passing the drive handle to
<A HREF="093_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl</A> Category 8, <A HREF="958_L3_DSK_LOCKDRIVE00hLock.html">DSK_LOCKDRIVE</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Perform designed I/O operations to the disk.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unlock the disk using <A HREF="093_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>Category 8, DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When using the raw file system to access a physical disk and disk locking
is required, the OPEN_SHARE_DENYREADWRITE flag should be used. The disk
will be automatically unlocked when a <A HREF="084_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose
</A>is done.
