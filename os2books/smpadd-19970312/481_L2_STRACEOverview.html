<H1>STRACE Overview</H1><!-- entering slot 496 -->
<P>
STRACE uses software trace hooks to collect data.  Trace hooks are identified
by both a major code and a minor code.  Major code 1 is reserved for exclusive
use by IBM.  Major codes 0x00b8 (184) and 0x00b9 (185) have been reserved
for customer use.  A listing of major and minor codes associated with OS/2
Warp Server for SMP can be found in <A HREF="500_L2_SystemTraceHookDefin.html">System
Trace Hook Definitions</A>.
<P>
For major codes other than 0x00b8 and 0x00b9 mentioned above, the user identifies
the major codes to be traced with the<B> TRACE</B> command.
<P>
To turn tracing on for events with major codes of 0x0002, 0x0013, and 0x0042:

<PRE>  TRACE ON 2 19 66
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The TRACE command requires decimal arguments.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
If<B> TRACE ON</B> is specified without one or more major codes, tracing
for all major codes, except 1, is enabled.
<P>
STRACE.EXE uses the general purpose performance function <A HREF="197_L2_DosPerfSysCall.html">DosPerfSysCall
</A>to access the software trace buffer.  When STRACE is turned on, it allocates
the required buffers (one per processor) in the kernel space and starts
tracing immediately.  A user may turn off STRACE (to stop collecting trace
data), copy the buffers to the user's buffer, flush the buffer to restart
tracing, or reset STRACE (turn off and free the allocated buffers).
