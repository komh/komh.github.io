<H1>What is the ICAT Debugger</H1><!-- entering slot 300 -->
<P>
The ICAT Debugger (hereafter referred to in this chapter as the debugger)
is a source-level debugger which uses OS/2 Warp 3.0, OS/2 Warp Connect,
or OS/2 Warp Version 4 to assist in detecting and diagnosing errors in an
OS/2 Warp Server for SMP system. It provides a graphical user interface
and debugs PM and non-PM (single- or multi-threaded) applications as well
as device drivers and other system-level binaries.
<P>
This debugger has been designed to debug remotely an OS/2 Warp Server for
SMP system. The Kernel Debugger (KDB) runs on a victim OS/2 Warp Server
for SMP machine and replies to debug service requests that are sent from
the debugger while running on an Intel-based OS/2 Warp 3.0, OS/2 Warp Connect,
or OS/2 Warp Version 4 machine. The supported communication mode between
machines is serial.
<P>
Supported debug file formats include HLL (which is IBM VisualAge C++ (VACPP))
and CodeView (CV).
