<H1>Setting Environment Variables</H1><!-- entering slot 305 -->
<P>
The debugger uses environment variables to manage debugging sessions and
remote communications. To set the environmental variables, you will need
to edit the SETICAT.CMD file. The environment variables should be set in
the OS/2 session where the debugger is to be run.  The environment variables
are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
CAT_MACHINE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies which host com port the debugger
uses to communicate with KDB and the baud rate for communications.  This
variable has the following form:
<PRE>   COMx:nnnn
</PRE>
where<I> x</I> identifies the port (for example, 1 for COM1) and<I> nnnn
</I>specifies the baud rate.  The following rates are supported:<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->9600 (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->19200<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->38400<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->57600<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->115200<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> For speeds above
19200, you need buffered UARTs on both the host and victim machines.  For
speeds above 57600, you need customized serial drivers such as SIO.SYS or
the COM.SYS that ships with Warp Version 4 (which can also be used with
earlier versions of Warp).
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_MACHINE=COM2:57600
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Ensure that your communication port is enabled if you use
a ThinkPad.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CAT_SETUP_RATE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> When
the debugger first attempts to communicate with KDB, it does so at the baud
rate specified by this environment variable or at 9600 baud if this variable
is not defined.  If the communication succeeds, the debugger changes the
baud rate to the rate specified by the CAT_MACHINE environment variable
and proceeds.  Otherwise, the debugger tries to  initiate contact at the
rate specified by the CAT_MACHINE environment variable.  If neither attempt
succeeds, the debugger issues an error message.
<P>
In most cases, you do<B> not</B> need to set CAT_SETUP_RATE.  It is primarily
useful if you have been communicating with the victim system directly (for
example, using ZOC or T) and have left the serial line running at a rate
other than 9600 baud that does not match the rate specified by the CAT_MACHINE
environment variable.
<P>
Additionally, if this environment variable is set, the debugger will reset
KDB to this rate when the debugger is closed.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_SETUP_RATE=9600
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_HOST_BIN_PATH<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Tells
the debugger where to find your debug binaries (the .SYS and .EXE files
with debug information) on your host system.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_HOST_BIN_PATH=I:\SDE\SAMDETW
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_COMMUNICATION_TYPE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Allows
asynchronous communications. Currently, this must be set to ASYNC_SIGBRK
in subsequent releases it is planned to support other forms of communication.

<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_COMMUNICATION_TYPE=ASYNC_SIGBRK
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_HOST_SOURCE_PATH<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Tells
the debugger where to find the source files that were used to build your
debug binaries. See <A HREF="295_L3_FindingSourceFiles.html">Finding Source
Files</A> for more details.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_HOST_SOURCE_PATH=I:\SDE\SAMDETW;E:\icat\testcases\src
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_PATH_RECURSE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Causes
a recursive search of the subdirectories below the subdirectories listed
in CAT_HOST_BIN_PATH and CAT_HOST_SOURCE_PATH. For example, with the CAT_HOST_SOURCE_PATH=i\sde\samdetw
variable, the debugger will search the samdetw subdirectory and all subdirectories
below samdetw as well as their subdirectories.  The default is NULL, which
means the debugger will not perform a recursive search. When the variable
is set to any non-null value, the recursive search is performed.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
set CAT_PATH_RECURSE=ON<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CAT_MODULE_LIST<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> By
default, the debugger obtains information about<!-- entering slot 306 --> every
executable module (DLL, EXE, device driver, and so on) running on the victim
system.  As a result, it can take several minutes to attach to the victim
system.  If the CAT_MODULE_LIST environment variable is defined, the debugger
only obtains information about a module if its name appears in the environment
variable string.  (The debugger always obtains information about the kernel
itself.)  This can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for the
debugger to come up.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>    set CAT_MODULE_LIST=SAMPLEDD.SYS SAMPLE.EXE
</PRE>

<P>
The debugger will only obtain information on the kernel and the two modules
listed in CAT_MODULE_LIST.  (If a program named LE.EXE were running, the
debugger would also obtain information on it since LE.EXE is a substring
of SAMPLE.EXE.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CAT_RESUME<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> During
debugger initialization, the debugger stops the victim system in order to
establish the desired baud rate.  The debugger then continues its initialization
and eventually allows the user to attach to the victim system.  By default,
the debugger does not allow the victim system to resume execution during
this interval.  This behavior is necessary to debug a system that has already
reached a failure or that contains a hardcoded INT3 instruction (as device
drivers often do).
<P>
There could be situations where you want to initialize the debugger, but
somehow time your attach to the victim system using the Attach push button.
 In this case, define CAT_RESUME, and then the debugger will resume the
victim system waiting for your attach command to stop it again.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_RESUME=ON
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_DIAL and CAT_MODEM_INIT<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
host and victim machines can be connected directly (with a null modem serial
cable) or by way of modem.  If either of these variables is defined, the
debugger sets up the COM port specified by the CAT_MACHINE environment variable
so that the debugger can talk to a modem. The debugger then issues the modem
attention string (+++) followed by the string specified by the CAT_MODEM_INIT
variable (if any) to initialize the modem.  The debugger then issues the
string specified by the CAT_DIAL variable (if any) and waits 500 seconds
for the remote modem to answer.
<P>
The CAT_MODEM_INIT environment variable should be based on the string your
terminal emulator uses to initialize the modem. This string presumably doesn't
change very often.  Once you have determined the correct AT commands, you
can keep the CAT_MODEM_INIT environment variable constant and change CAT_DIAL
when you need to place calls to different numbers.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_MODEM_INIT=ATZ
   set CAT_DIAL=ATDT4840
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CAT_OVERRIDE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies
a path that the debugger searches first to find the source files that were
used to build your debug binaries.  See "Finding Source Files" below for
a complete description of the process.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CAT_OVERRIDE=e:\temp\updates
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CATTAB<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies the number
of spaces between tab stops when source code containing<!-- entering slot 307 --> tabs
is displayed in a debugger window.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set CATTAB=5
</PRE>

<P>
The debugger will convert each tab in the source to 5 spaces when the source
is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CATTABGRID<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies
the column positions for the tab stops when source code containing tabs
is displayed in a debugger window.
<P>
For example, typing the following command at the command prompt sets tab
stops at the 6th position:
<PRE>   set CATTABGRID=6
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>DEBUG_NUMBEROFELEMENTS<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> DEBUG_NUMBEROFELEMENTS
is an environment variable that is set to an integer,<B><I> n</B></I>. This
integer represents the default number of elements displayed for a variable
or structure that has a substantial number of elements. The last element
displayed for such a structure is labeled "more elements." Clicking on this
entry will display the next<B><I> n</B></I> elements of the variable or
structure.
<P>
For example, type the following at the command prompt:
<PRE>   set DEBUG_NUMBEROFELEMENTS=100
</PRE>

<P>
The next 100 elements are displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
