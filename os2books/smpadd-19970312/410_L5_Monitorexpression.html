<H1>Monitor expression...</H1><!-- entering slot 425 -->
<P>
Displays the Monitor Expression in Storage window, which allows you to type
in the name of the expression you want to monitor.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="410_L5_Monitorexpression_56.gif" WIDTH=346 HEIGHT=189 ALIGN=center>
<P>
To specify an expression, type the name or address of the variable or expression
you want to monitor in the Expression entry field.
<P>
The expression evaluator used is based on the context.  For example if you
display the Storage window by selecting the<B> Monitor expression...</B> choice
from the<B> Monitors</B> menu, the evaluator used is based on the context
in the Monitor Expression window.  However, if you display the Storage window
first and then select the<B> Monitor expression...</B> choice from the<B> Options
</B>menu of the Storage window, the evaluator used is based on the context
of the stopping thread.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> You cannot look at variables that have been defined using
the #DEFINE preprocessor directive. If the variable is not in scope when
the monitor is opened, the default address is displayed.  If the variable
goes out of scope, the address is changed to a hex constant.
<P>
If you enable the Enabled monitor check box, the monitor updates the stop
value of the program to the actual value in storage. However, a disabled
monitor suspends this updating and reflects the stop value or the value
held when the monitor was disabled.
