<H1>Using the Passthru Window</H1><!-- entering slot 451 -->
<P>
The Passthru window allows you to send commands to KDB and view its responses.
 The window is divided into two areas.  The Command entry field area is
where you enter the KDB commands, and the response area is used to display
the KDB output.
<P>
The KDB response area is scrollable, which allows you to review previous
KDB responses from prior commands.  This output area also appends a status
icon for each line to indicate your input, the debugger's acceptance of
that input, and text from KDB.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When you send KDB commands using the Passthru window, the
debugger does<B> not</B> update its state.  Thus, you should use this window
for obtaining information instead of altering registers or data.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="436_L3_UsingthePassthruWind_58.gif" WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=381 ALIGN=center>
<P>
To send a command to KDB, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Type the command you want to send in the<B> Command
</B>entry field.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select the Send push button.  You can also press
the Enter key if the Enter key performs send function check box is enabled
in the Display Style window.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select the Resync button to force the debugger
to refresh all of its internal caches of the victim machine state.  Use
this button if you used the Passthru window to alter the state on the victim
machine.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Commands that cause the victim machine to resume execution
(for example, g and t) should be avoided.  They can cause the debugger to
lock up. The debugger tries to filter out the KDB commands that can cause
a lockup, but you should always exercise caution.
