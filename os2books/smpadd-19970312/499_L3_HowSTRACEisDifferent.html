<P>
Software Tracing uses the OS/2 Trace facility control utility, TRACE.EXE,
to enable and disable the tracing of events.
<P>
Software Tracing is performed to special trace buffers which are allocated,
one per processor, when STRACE is initialized or turned on.  Thus, the information
recorded by Software Trace does not go into the OS/2 Trace facility's System
Trace buffer and the recording can be efficiently done in a multiprocessing
environment.  The user can alter the size of the buffers with the STRACE
command to collect much more data than TRACE can.
<P>
The trace hooks placed in the kernel for software tracing are there for
performance use, as opposed to the ones for TRACE which are positioned primarily
as debugging aids. Software Tracing utilizes the 64-bit Pentium Time Stamp
Counter to provide precise time stamping of events.
<P>
Software trace information is formatted by using the<B> POST</B> option
of STRACE.  STRACE also permits the transfer of trace data to disk for processing
on other systems, provided, of course, that<B> STRACE.EXE</B> has been copied
to the other system.
<P>
