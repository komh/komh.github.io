<H1>Sample Use of STRACE</H1><!-- entering slot 501 -->
<P>
Let's say you are running a program called<B> COLLIE.EXE</B> which uses
queues to fetch data from another program.  You could use STRACE to gather
performance data on how the semaphore operations associated with the queuing
activities are handled, or you could use it to monitor what semaphore operations
are done to help diagnose a hang in the program.  The control program semaphore
functions use major code 0x0018 (see <A HREF="503_L3_DosFunctions2of12.html">Dos
Functions - 2 of 12</A>), therefore the following sequence of commands could
be used:
<P>

<PRE> 1.  Turn trace on for the desired major code,      <B>TRACE ON 24</B>
     0x0018 in this case.
 
 2.  Turn on STRACE                                 <B>STRACE ON</B>
 
 3.  Run the desired program.                       <B>START COLLIE</B>
 
 4.  When program completes, or at the appropriate  <B>STRACE OFF</B>
     time, turn off STRACE.                         <B>TRACE OFF</B>
 
 5.  Get a copy of the trace information from all
     processors.                                    <B>STRACE GET /R=RUN1.RAW</B>
 
 6.  Clear the trace buffers in preparation for
     running the program again.                     <B>STRACE FLUSH</B>
 
 7.  Turn on STRACE again.                          <B>TRACE ON 24</B>
                                                    <B>STRACE ON</B>
 
 8.  Run the program again.                         <B>START COLLIE</B>
 
 9.  Turn off STRACE at the appropriate time.       <B>STRACE OFF</B>
                                                    <B>TRACE OFF</B>
 
 10. Copy the trace buffers to another file.        <B>STRACE GET /R=RUN2.RAW</B>
 
 11. If all tracing is complete, you could now      <B>STRACE RESET</B>
     delete the trace buffers.
 
 12. Generate readable trace data and explicitly    <B>STRACE POST /R=RUN1.RAW</B>
     name all output files.                         <B>            /M=RUN1.MTE</B>
                                                    <B>            /O=RUN1.OUT</B>
</PRE>
