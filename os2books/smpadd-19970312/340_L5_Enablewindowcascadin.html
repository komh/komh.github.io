<P>
Select the<B> Enable window cascading</B> choice to have the debugging windows
overlap each other.
<P>
When you enable this choice, successive windows that are opened overlap
each other on the screen.  However, they are cascaded so that you can see
the underlying windows.  When this choice is disabled, successive windows
cover previously displayed windows so that you do not see the underlying
windows.
