<H1>Compiling and Linking Your Program</H1><!-- entering slot 304 -->
<P>
Before using the debugger, you need to compile and link your program.
<P>
For VACPP programs, use the following options:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Ti+<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles your program to produce an object
file that includes line number information and a symbol table in addition
to the source code.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /O-<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles
your program with optimization off. This is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Oi-
<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>Compiles your program with inlining off.  This is
the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /DEbug<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Links
your program to produce an executable file that includes line number information
and a symbol table in addition to the executable code.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When you specify the /Ti+ option with the /DEbug option, icc
passes this option to the linker automatically, so you only need to use
it if you link separately from the compile.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For more information about compiling and linking your program, refer to
<I>IBM C++ Tools Programming Guide</I>.
<P>
For Microsoft CL, CL386, MASM, and MASM386 programs, use the following options:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>Zi<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles your program to produce an object
file that includes line number information and a symbol table, in addition
to the source code.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Od<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles
your program with optimization off.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /CO<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Links
your program to produce an executable file that includes line number information
and a symbol table in addition to the executable code.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For Watcom wpp386 programs, use the following options:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>d2<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles your program with full debugging
information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> -hc<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles
your program emitting CodeView debug format (currently, the debugger only
supports Watcom's CodeView debug format).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> -od<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Compiles
your program with optimization off.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For the Watcom linker, wlink, use this option:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
d codeview<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Links your program with CodeView debug
format.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The debugger supports a separate debug file (from your created application)
for the Watcom compiler.  For the Watcom linker, wlink, use this option
to create a separate debug file if desired:
<P>
op symf
<P>
This will create a .sym file.  Be careful not to confuse this file with
a KDB .sym file.  The debugger looks for debug information first in the
application file.  If it doesn't find it, it looks for the debug information
in a .dbg file and then in a .sym file as a last resort.  Most users rename
the separate Watcom .sym file to a .dbg file.
