<H1>Set watchpoint...</H1><!-- entering slot 336 -->
<P>
Displays the<B> Watchpoint</B> window, which allows you to set a watchpoint
to stop the execution of your program when contents of memory at a given
address are referenced, when an instruction is fetched from a particular
address, or when an I/O port at a particular address is referenced.
<P>

<P>
Use the Watchpoint window to set a watchpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Address (or Expression) or Port # Entry Field</B>
<P>
Type a hexadecimal address or port or an expression that can be evaluated
to a hexadecimal address.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you type ABC in the Address (or Expression) or Port # entry
field, and there is a variable named ABC, the value of the variable is used
instead of the hex value ABC. Also, you can type &amp;a in the Address (or
Expression) or Port # entry field to set the watchpoint on the address of
a variable<I> a</I>.
<P>
For example, type the following in the<B> Address (or Expression) or Port
#</B> entry field to set a watchpoint for the address<I> A1FCC</I>.
<PRE>   A1FCC
</PRE>

<P>
Type the following in the<B> Address (or Expression) or Port #</B> entry
field to set a watchpoint for the expression<I> &amp;variable</I>.
<PRE>   &amp;variable

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Bytes to Monitor Radio Buttons</B>
<P>
The debugger will monitor 1, 2, or 4 bytes for the type of watchpoint operation
that you select.  This choice is made for you on the<B> Instruction fetch
</B>and<B> I/O Port</B> types.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Watchpoint Radio Buttons</B>
<P>
The debugger supports four types of watchpoints. They are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<BR>
I/O Port<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Causes a break when the port address is
read from or written to.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Write<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Causes
a break when the address is written to.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Read or
write<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Causes a break when the address is read from
or written to.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Instruction fetch<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Causes
a break when the instruction at that address is fetched.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Warning:</B> If you set a watchpoint that is on the call stack, you should
remove the watchpoint before leaving the routine associated with the watchpoint.
 Otherwise, when you return from the routine, the routine's stack frame
will be removed from the stack leaving the watchpoint intact.  Any other
routine that gets loaded on the stack will then contain the watchpoint.
You can set up to four watchpoints.
<P>
