<H1>Set line...</H1><!-- entering slot 333 -->
<P>
Displays the Line Breakpoint window, which allows you to set a line breakpoint
to stop the execution of your program at a specific line number.

<P>
The Line Breakpoint window is divided into two group headings:<B> Required
Parameters</B> and<B> Optional Parameters</B>.
<P>
The<B> Required Parameters</B> group heading contains the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Executable Entry Field</B>
<P>
To select a component from the Executable list:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Type the executable name in the entry field
<I>or</I> open the Executable list by selecting the list button. This displays
a drop-down combination box.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Highlight the executable where you want to set
the breakpoint<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Source Entry Field</B>
<P>
To select a component from the Source list:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>  1.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Type
the source name in the entry field<I> or</I> open the Source list by selecting
the list button. This displays a drop-down combination box.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> 2.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Highlight the source where you want to set
the breakpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Include File Entry Field</B>
<P>
If the source you selected has include files with executable statements,
then the File list displays all the file names that contain executable lines.
<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Type the name of the file
in the entry field<I> or</I> open the File list by selecting the list button.
This displays a drop-down combination box.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> 2.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Highlight the file where you want to set
the breakpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Line Entry Field</B>
<P>
To set a line breakpoint, type the line number in the Line entry field.
The breakpoint is set on the line number.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> Optional Parameters</B> group heading contains the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Thread Entry Field</B>
<P>
To select a thread ID from the Thread list:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>  1.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Open
the Thread list by selecting the list button. This displays a drop-down
combination box.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> 2.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Highlight the thread where you want to set
the breakpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Select Every, the default, to set
a breakpoint in all of the active threads in your program. The<B> Every
</B>choice is thread independent. Select one of the individual threads to
set a breakpoint in one thread only.  Threads are added to the<B> Thread
</B>list as new threads are activated.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>From Entry Field</B>
<P>
This field is used for location breakpoints, address breakpoints and load
occurrence breakpoints. Type in a number to start activating the breakpoint
the<I> nth</I> time the location is encountered.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>To Entry Field</B>
<P>
This field is used for location breakpoints, address breakpoints and load
occurrence breakpoints. Type in a number to stop activating the breakpoint
after the<I> nth</I> time the location is encountered.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Every Entry Field</B>
<P>
This field is used for location breakpoints, address breakpoints and load
occurrence breakpoints. Type in a number to indicate how often the breakpoint
should be activated within the<B> From</B> and<B> To</B> range.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Expression Entry Field</B>
<P>
If you are setting an address, function, or line breakpoint, you can also
type in an expression.  The execution of the program stops only if this
condition tests true. For example, you could type the following:
<PRE>   (i==1) || (j==k) &amp;&amp; (k!=5)</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Variables in a conditional expression associated with a<I> function
</I>breakpoint are limited to any static or global variables that are known
to the called function when the function is called. Local variables and
automatic variables will not evaluate correctly.
<P>
The maximum length of the condition is 256 characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Defer breakpoint Check Box</B>
<P>
Enable the Defer breakpoint check box if you want to set a breakpoint in
a module that is not currently loaded.
<P>
If you set a deferred line breakpoint and the line is located in a template,
the debugger sets the line breakpoint in all of the templates when the module
is loaded.
<P>
When a module is loaded and a deferred breakpoint has been set in the module,
the state of the breakpoint changes from deferred to active. When a module
is freed, any breakpoints that were set in the module change from the active
state to deferred state.
<P>
If you enter an invalid source, file or line number, the debugger will be
unable to activate the breakpoint when the module is loaded. Therefore,
the invalid breakpoint will remain in the deferred state even after the
module is loaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
