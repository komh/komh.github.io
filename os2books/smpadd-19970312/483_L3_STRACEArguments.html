<H1>STRACE Arguments</H1><!-- entering slot 498 -->
<P>
One of the following arguments is required.  The first valid command is
used.  All others will be ignored and a warning is issued to the user.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
ON<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Turns STRACE ON.  If STRACE is off, this command
causes the buffers to be allocated if needed and turns tracing on.  If STRACE
is currently on, this command has no effect.  The default buffer size per
processor is 3 MB which can be changed by using the /S option described
below.  Note that if buffers exist at the time of this command, no new buffers
will be allocated.  Tracing is simply turned on using the existing buffers,
whatever size they may be.  Tracing will be automatically turned off when
any buffer on any processor is full.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> OFF<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Turns
STRACE OFF.  If STRACE is on, this command turns tracing off.  The buffers
are not freed.  If STRACE is currently off, this command has no effect.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>INIT<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Initializes STRACE.
 This command causes the buffers to be allocated if necessary, but does
not turn tracing on.  If STRACE is currently on, this command has no effect.
The default buffer size per processor is 3 MB, which can be changed using
the /S option.  Note that if buffers exist at the time of this command,
no new buffers will be allocated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> RESET<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Resets
STRACE.  If STRACE is on, this command turns tracing off.  Whether STRACE
was on or off, any allocated trace buffers will be freed and the contents
discarded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FLUSH<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Flushes
STRACE buffers.  This command causes all data in the trace buffers to be
discarded.  The buffers remain allocated if they exist. This command does
not alter the state of tracing.  If STRACE is on, it will remain on and
tracing continues into an empty buffer.  If STRACE is off, it remains off.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>INFO<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Returns the status
of STRACE.  Indicates whether STRACE is active or not, the current buffer
allocation, and data collection statistics, such as number of bytes collected.
 This command does not alter the state of tracing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> GET
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Returns a copy of the trace buffers. This command
returns all trace data to the user in a binary file in the current directory
called<B> STRACE.RAW</B>.  Use the /R option to direct the output to a different
file and path.  This file is processed using the<B> POST</B> option of STRACE,
to convert it to a readable format. This command does not alter the state
of tracing.  Trace major codes should be disabled prior to issuing STRACE
GET.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> POST<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Processes the
binary file returned from the<B> GET</B> option and produces two files:
 an integrated ASCII dump of the trace and an MTE (module table entry) loader
dump output file. The default input file is<B> STRACE.RAW</B>, the default
ASCII dump output file is<B> STRACE.OUT</B>, and the default MTE dump output
file is<B> STRACE.MTE</B>  Use the /R, /O, and /M options respectively to
specify a different file name, or fully-qualified path and file name, for
each.  This command does not alter the state of tracing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MAJOR
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Displays the active STRACE major codes being traced.
This command does not alter the state of tracing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> VERSION
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Displays the current version of STRACE. This command
does not alter the state of tracing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MTE<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Captures
Module Table Entry data and writes it to the MTE loader dump file.  Use
the /M option to direct the output to a file other than<B> STRACE.MTE</B>.
 Module Table entry data provides information about loaded memory objects,
their sizes, addresses and process affiliations.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> INSERT
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Dynamically inserts trace hooks into the kernel.
 The user can insert a major code group.  For example for major code 19,
<B>strace insert 19</B>. The user can insert a particular major/minor code.
For example, 19/1,<B> strace insert 19 1</B>.  Very few software trace hooks
are dynamic; most are already inserted, and the<B> strace insert</B> and
<B>strace remove</B> commands have no affect.  At present, only hooks associated
with major code 0x0013 (19) can be inserted with this capability.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> REMOVE
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Dynamically remove trace hooks from the kernel.
 The user can remove a major code group.  For example for major code 19,
<B>strace remove 19</B>.  The user can remove a particular major/minor code.
 For example, 19/1,<B> strace remove 19 1</B>. At present, only hooks associated
with major code 0x0013 (19) can be removed with this capability.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> NRM
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>For IBM Use Only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
