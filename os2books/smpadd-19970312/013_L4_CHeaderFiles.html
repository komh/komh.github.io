<P>
OS/2 functions that used to take a <A HREF="843_L2_PSZ.html">PSZ</A> as
a parameter, and that do not modify the contents of the passed string, have
been updated in the C++ header files to take a <A HREF="821_L2_PCSZ.html">PCSZ
</A>data type parameter. The use of <A HREF="821_L2_PCSZ.html">PCSZ</A> allows
for better optimization by the compiler and is more semantically compatible
with C++. Existing code that calls functions that use <A HREF="843_L2_PSZ.html">PSZ
</A>will continue to work correctly.
<P>
Several of the typedefs have been changed in the C++ header files. For example,
many items that are unsigned char in the C header files are char in the
C++ header files. For instance,
<PRE>
typedef unsigned char BYTE;

</PRE>
has changed to
<PRE>
typedef char BYTE;

</PRE>

<P>
The existing samples that are included in the IBM Developer's Toolkit for
OS/2 Warp Version 3 can be used with either set of the header files.
