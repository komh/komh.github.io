<H1>What's New Since OS/2 for SMP 2.11</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
OS/2 Warp Server Version 4 Advanced provides:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A HREF="042_L1_HighMemorySupport.html">High Memory Support</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Memory
management has been enhanced to allow 32-bit applications to allocate and
address linear memory objects above the 512MB boundary.  This effectively
breaks the 512MB memory limit in previous versions of OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="082_L1_RawFileSystem.html">Raw
File System</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The Raw File System provides the
ability to access physical or logical drives using a UNC name.  Since drive
access is no longer limited to available drive letters, more than 26 physical
and logical drives are now available to 32-bit applications.  This allows
access to up to 128 drives without incurring the serialization overhead
of the OS/2 file system.  In addition, the raw file system supports physical
disks up to 1 TB (terabyte) in size.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Enhanced File
I/O Support<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> With the addition of the <A HREF="110_L2_DosListIO.html">DosListIO
</A>function, multiple locking, unlocking, seeking, and I/O operations may
now be initiated at once.  These can be synchronous (ordered) requests or,
in the case of the Raw File System, unordered requests.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MPS
1.4 Compliant Intel I/O APIC Support<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> OS/2 Warp
Server for SMP now recognizes multiple MPS 1.4 compliant Intel I/O Advanced
Programmable Interrupt Controllers (APICs) in a system.  Multiple I/O APICs
increases the number of adapters allowed on the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="480_L1_SoftwareTraceFacilit.html">Software
Trace Facility (STRACE)</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> STRACE is a tracing
tool available on Pentium-class machines which provides a software-based
timing and tracing mechanism. With the addition of the <A HREF="197_L2_DosPerfSysCall.html">DosPerfSysCall
</A>function, software running in ring 3 may now record events in the software
trace buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Performance Monitoring<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> OS/2
Warp Server for SMP provides a set of functions which allow application
developers an efficient and uniform way to access system performance information
and to monitor and change processor status.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="288_L1_TheICATDebugger.html">The
ICAT Debugger</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The ICAT debugger is a source-level
debugger used for remotely debugging OS/2 device drivers, kernel code, Installable
File Systems (IFS), and applications running on an OS/2 Warp Server for
SMP machine from another OS/2 system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="240_L1_KernelDebugger.html">Kernel
Debugger</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The protocols necessary for communicating
with the kernel debugger over a serial communications link have been made
available for application developers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
