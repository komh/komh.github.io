<H1>Introduction to OS/2 Warp Server Version 4 Advanced</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
This document provides a guide for developers writing applications and device
drivers exploiting the symmetrical multiprocessing capabilities of OS/2
Warp Server Version 4 Advanced.
<P>
The purpose of this reference is to give information about functions, constants,
and data structures.  It provides information about the functions which
enable the user to call functions in the C programming language.
<P>
OS/2 Warp Server for SMP was developed to satisfy the need to run OS/2 on
multiprocessor based CISC processors, namely the Intel x86 compatible family.
 The requirements for OS/2 Warp Server for SMP were that it run all existing
applications, device drivers and subsystems, as well as take advantage of
new multiprocessor (MP) exploitive applications and device drivers.
<P>
The emergence of low-cost MP hardware based on the 486, Pentium, and Pentium
Pro processors makes OS/2 Warp Server for SMP an attractive desktop operating
environment. Server and workstation environments using the x86 architecture
are moving toward the more powerful emerging RISC based chip sets.  These
new RISC processors lack the full range of programming tools available for
the x86 chip set. OS/2 Warp Server for SMP attempts to solve the problems
of insufficient processor bandwidth by supporting multiple x86 processors
in a single computer.
<P>
To provide increased performance, OS/2 Warp Server for SMP allows applications,
file system, mass storage and network drivers to execute on any processor
at any time.  A number of databases and applications have been modified
to take advantage of the additional features provided by OS/2 Warp Server
for SMP.  DB2/2 and CICS are two databases that IBM has modified to run
better under OS/2 Warp Server for SMP.  These application can benefit greatly
from OS/2 Warp Server for SMP  because they are CPU-intensive.  Other applications
which can also benefit from OS/2 Warp Server for SMP are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
