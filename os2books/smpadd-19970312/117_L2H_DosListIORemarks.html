<H1>DosListIO - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
DosListIO applies the same restrictions for each seek/read and seek/write
operations as would be applied if the requests were issued separately with
DosSetFilePtr, DosRead, and DosWrite.
<P>
The actual number of bytes read or written, along with the operation return
code are returned in the <A HREF="808_L2_LISTIO.html">LISTIO</A> structure
upon completion of the request, therefore care must be taken that the memory
containing the LISTIO control blocks is not deallocated or manipulated by
another thread before the DosListIO request returns.
<P>
There are two valid modes for the list of I/O operations to be processed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
ORDERED<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> This mode guarantees that the operations
are performed in the order specified.  DosFileIO will return with an error
code corresponding to the first failed request and will not attempt to process
the remaining requests.  This provides a synchronous sequence of atomic
I/O requests.  This is the only mode that is compatible with file systems
other than the Raw File System.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> UNORDERED<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> This
mode does not guarantee the order that the operations are performed or the
order that the operations complete.  DosFileIO will return with an error
code if any request fails.  Additionally, each request in the list will
be issued, even those following a failed operation.  This mode is valid
for the Raw File System only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
