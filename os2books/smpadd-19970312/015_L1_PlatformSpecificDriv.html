<H1>Platform Specific Drivers (PSDs)</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
In OS/2 Warp Server for SMP, all of the platform specific code has been
removed from the operating system, and placed into a Platform Specific Driver.
These drivers provide an abstraction layer for the underlying hardware by
allowing the operating system to call generic functions to perform platform-specific
operations without worrying about the actual hardware implementation. This
allows OS/2 Warp Server for SMP to support new MP hardware platforms without
modifying the operating system.
<P>
PSDs are 32-bit flat DLLs specified in CONFIG.SYS by using the PSD= keyword,
and must conform to the 8.3 file naming convention (e.g. PSD=BELIZE.PSD).
They cannot contain either drive or path information because OS/2 cannot
process such information at the stage of the startup sequence when the PSD
statements are processed. The root directory of the startup partition is
first searched for the specified file name, followed by the \OS2 directory
of the startup partition. If drive or path information is included in a
PSD statement, an error is generated.
<P>
PSD parameters may be specified after the PSD's name, and may be a maximum
of 1024 characters long. The parameter string is not interpreted or parsed
by OS/2, but is passed verbatim as an ASCIIZ string when the PSD's Install
function is invoked.
<P>
If multiple PSD statements are encountered, OS/2 will load each PSD in the
order listed in CONFIG.SYS, and call the PSD's install function. The first
PSD which successfully installs will be the one OS/2 uses.
<P>
PSD statements are processed before BASEDEV, IFS, and DEVICE statements.
