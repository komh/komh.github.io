<H1>Packet Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 255 -->
<P>
To enter packet mode from raw mode, or to get the kernel debugger's attention
while the system is running and enter packet mode, the debug engine should
send the<B> KDP break</B> character (0x1f).  If the system was running,
the kernel debugger will respond with an event packet containing a CVK_RET_ASYNC
event.  If the system was quiesced, the kernel debugger will not respond
at all.
<P>
