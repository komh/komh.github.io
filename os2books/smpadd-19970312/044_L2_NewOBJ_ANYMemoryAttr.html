<H1>New OBJ_ANY Memory Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 47 -->
<P>
A new allocation attribute of OBJ_ANY is available to 32-bit programs when
allocating memory using <A HREF="047_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> and
<A HREF="058_L2_DosAllocSharedMem.html">DosAllocSharedMem</A>. OBJ_ANY indicates
that the memory may be allocated anywhere in the available virtual address
space.  An application must be able to handle pointer values above the 512
MB<I> tiled memory compatibility region</I> when using OBJ_ANY.
<P>
In OS/2 Warp Server for SMP, OBJ_ANY memory allocations will<B> first</B> be
attempted in the high memory area, which is the area of the virtual address
space above 512 MB.  If there is insufficient memory to satisfy the request
from the high memory area, the memory will be allocated in the first 512
MB of the address space.  IBM reserves the right to change this allocation
strategy in future releases of OS/2.
<P>
Memory objects allocated below the 512 MB line will start on a 64 KB boundary,
the size will be rounded up to a multiple of 64 KB, and the memory will
be tileable.
<P>
Objects allocated above the 512 MB line will start on a 4 KB boundary, the
size will be rounded up to a multiple of 4 KB, and the memory will<B> not
</B>be tileable.  16-bit programs will not be able to address or access
the object.
<P>
Memory should be allocated with the OBJ_ANY attribute wherever possible,
since it provides the most efficient use of both the per-process address
space as well as the system-wide virtual memory resources.  It is intended
that an application would make infrequent requests for large blocks of memory
using <A HREF="047_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> and then use DosSubSetMem
along with DosSubAllocMem and DosSubFreeMem to manage the memory. If OBJ_ANY
is not specified, the behavior of DosAllocMem and DosAllocSharedMem is the
same as in OS/2 Warp.
