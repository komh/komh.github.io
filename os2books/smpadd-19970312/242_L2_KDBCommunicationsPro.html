<H1>KDB Communications Protocol</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
Generally the kernel debugger communicates over a serial communications
link with a terminal emulator program running on another machine.  This
allows a user to debug a problem by issuing kernel debugger commands in
the emulator program and seeing the results displayed on the debug console.

<P>
To automate the debugging process, or to provide a high-level language debugging
environment, this interaction with the kernel debugger could instead be
handled by a program running on the other machine.  This<B> debug engine
</B>would interact with the user, convert the user's debugging request to
a series of kernel debugger commands, issue them, and then present the response
from the kernel debugger back to the user in a user-friendly format.
<P>
Communications between the debug engine and the kernel debugger can proceed
in one of two modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
raw (dumb TTY) mode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> ASCII characters are sent to
the kernel debugger one at a time. The kernel debugger echoes each character.
 A carriage return (^M or 0x0d) ends a line.  The kernel debugger returns
data to the debug engine one ASCII character at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> packet
mode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Packets are sent to the kernel debugger.  A
packet consists of a fixed sized header followed by zero or more bytes of
data.  The kernel debugger returns data to the debug engine in packets.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
