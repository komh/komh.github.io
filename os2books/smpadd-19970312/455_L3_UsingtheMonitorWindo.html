<H1>Using the Monitor Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 470 -->
<P>
The debugger has four other windows that allow you to monitor variables
and expressions.  These windows are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Popup Monitor<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Program Monitor<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Private Monitor<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Storage Monitor.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A Popup Monitor window monitors single variables or expressions. This window
is associated with a specific source window and closes when the associated
window closes.
<P>
The Program Monitor, Private Monitor, and Storage Monitor windows are used
as collectors for individual variables or expressions in which you might
be interested.
<P>
The difference between the Private Monitor window and the Program Monitor
window is the length of time that each remains open. The Program Monitor
window remains open for the entire debugging session. The Private Monitor
window is associated with the source window from which it was opened and
closes when its associated view is closed.
