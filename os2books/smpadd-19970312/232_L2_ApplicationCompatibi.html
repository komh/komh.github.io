<H1>Application Compatibility Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 243 -->
<P>
These compatibility requirements apply only to multithreaded applications,
and therefore do not apply to DOS and WINOS2 applications.  However, you
are strongly encouraged to write 32-bit multithreaded applications for better
performance and portability on OS/2 Warp Server for SMP.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An application or associated subsystem must not use
the<B> INC</B> instruction as a semaphore without prepending a<B> LOCK</B> prefix.
On a uniprocessor (UP) system this instruction can be used as high performance
semaphore without calling any other operating system service if the semaphore
is free and when the semaphore is clear and there are no waiters for the
semaphore.  Because the INC instruction can not be interrupted once started
and because the results would be stored in the flags register which are
per thread then it could be used safely as semaphore.
<P>
In an OS/2 Warp Server for SMP environment this technique will not work
because it is possible that two or more threads could be executing the same
<B>INC</B> instruction receiving the same results in each processor's/thread's
flag register thinking that they each have the semaphore.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Similarly a 486 or greater instruction such as the
CMPXCHG has the same problem above if a<B> LOCK</B> prefix is not prepended
before the instruction.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An application or associated subsystem which relies
on priorities to guarantee execution of its threads within a process will
not work in OS/2 Warp Server for SMP. For example an application may have
a time-critical and an idle thread and may assume that while the time-critical
thread is executing that the idle thread will not get any execution time
unless the time-critical thread explicitly yields the CPU.  In an OS/2 Warp
Server for SMP environment it is possible that both the time-critical and
idle threads are executing simultaneously on different processors.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The above compatibility requirements apply only to multithreaded applications,
and therefore do not apply to DOS and WINOS2 applications.  However, you
are strongly encouraged to write 32-bit multithreaded applications for better
performance and portability on OS/2 Warp Server for SMP.
<P>
Given that there is the possibility of some set of applications which may
use one of these techniques, OS/2 Warp Server for SMP provides a mechanism
whereby these multithreaded applications can execute in UP mode.  Only one
thread of that process would be allowed to execute at any given time. That
thread could execute on any one of the processors. A utility is used to
mark the EXE file as uniprocessor only. OS/2 forces the process to run in
the uniprocessor mode when the loader detects that the EXE file has been
marked as uniprocessor only.  See <A HREF="523_L1_ViewandSetProgramTyp.html">View
and Set Program Type For Executable File (MARKEXE)</A>.
