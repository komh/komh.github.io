<H1>Using the Demo</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
This demo shows a very simple set of DevIOCtl calls being made from a sample
application to a device driver.  It explains some of the actions you could
take to debug this scenario at the source level.
<P>
To run the demo, follow these steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy SAMPLEDD.SYS to the root directory of the
C drive on your victim system.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the victim system, edit CONFIG.SYS so that
it contains the following line:
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\SAMPLEDD.SYS
</PRE>

<P>
This loads the sample device driver when you reboot the victim system.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy SAMPLE.EXE to your victim system.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Reboot your victim machine so that the SAMPLEDD.SYS
binary and the debug OS2KRNL and OS2LDR binaries are instantiated.
<P>
You can perform a quick check to see if the victim machine is OK by running
your normal terminal emulator (T, ZOC, and so on).  This will show if KDB
is communicating at 9600 baud.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Shut down the terminal emulator before you run
the debugger.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run the SETICAT.CMD file to set the environment
variables on your host system.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Type icatgam.  The Initialization window displays.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the Initialization window, select the Attach
push button.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In the Debug Session Control, make sure you see
SAMPLEDD.SYS. Click on the plus sign (+) next to it and notice that one
part is displayed. Click on that plus sign (+) and notice eight entries
are now displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
10.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Click on STRATEGY. The STRATEGY routine of the
sampledd device driver should display in a source window.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This is MASM source, so you will see assembler directives,
but it is source.  We support both CodeView (CL and CL386) and HLL (IBM
VACPP) debug formats for C.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>11.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Set a breakpoint on line 209 inside the STRATEGY
routine by double-clicking on the line number.  Run the debugger by selecting
the<B> Run</B> button.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>12.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>On the victim machine, type sample. SAMPLE.EXE
will emit a DevIOCtl to open the SAMPLEDD device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>13.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>When the debugger notifies you that the breakpoint
has been encountered, open the Registers window and then open the Storage
window. Edit one of the addresses in this storage window by double-clicking
on the address and change the address value to that of the PC register,
which is located at the top of the list of status flags registers in the
Registers window. You will see memory that corresponds to the code space.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>14.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>From the Source window, select<B> Passthru
</B>from the<B> Monitors</B> menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>15.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>In the Passthru window, type dg cs in the
Command entry field and select the Send push button or press the Enter key.
This sends the command to KDB and the output is displayed in the response
area.  Notice that it provides information about SAMPLEDD's code descriptor.
 You can emit most KDB<!-- entering slot 313 --> commands from the Passthru
window.  Commands that cause the victim machine to resume execution (for
example, g and t) should be avoided.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you change the state of the victim machine with KDB commands
in the Passthru window, you must select the Resync push button to allow
the debugger to reflect the changes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>16.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Set another breakpoint on line 275 inside
the Open subroutine. Run the debugger until the breakpoint is encountered.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>17.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Select the<B> step into</B> choice or button
to do a step into on the Ccall macro to SubrWFrame. You are in the SubrWFrame
subroutine. Click on the<B> Call Stack</B> icon.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>18.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>From the Call Stack window, select the<B> Display
style</B> choice from the<B> Options</B> menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>19.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>From the Display style window, enable the
<B>Return Address</B> choice, which is located under the<B> Select items
</B>group heading.  Select the OK push button.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>20.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Select the<B> step over</B> choice or button
and notice the change in the Call Stack window.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>21.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Look at the Debug Session Control window
and find SAMPLE.EXE.  Click on the plus sign (+) and notice that one part
is displayed. Click on that plus sign (+) and you will see MAIN.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>22.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Click on MAIN and set a breakpoint at line
44.  Run the debugger by selecting the<B> Run</B> button.  The breakpoint
will be encountered in the STRATEGY routine again.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>23.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Run one more time and the breakpoint will
be encountered in SAMPLE.EXE in MAIN.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After you have completed these steps, close the debugger.  At this point,
you can use your terminal emulator to communicate with KDB.  If you did
not use the CAT_SETUP_RATE environment variable, KDB will be set at the
baud rate you used to communicate with the debugger.
