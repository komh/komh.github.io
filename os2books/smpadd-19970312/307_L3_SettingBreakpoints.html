<H1>Setting Breakpoints</H1><!-- entering slot 321 -->
<P>
You can control how your program executes by setting breakpoints.  A breakpoint
stops the execution of your program at a specific location or when a specific
event occurs.
<P>
To set breakpoints, select the<B> Breakpoints</B> menu from the Debug Session
Control window or from any of the source windows and select the appropriate
choice for the type of breakpoint you want to set. You can also set a simple
line breakpoint by double-clicking in the<I> prefix area</I> of an executable
statement in any of the source windows.  The prefix area is the area to
the left of the source code where line numbers or addresses are displayed.
The prefix area turns red indicating that the breakpoint has been set. You
can also use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the prefix area and then
use the space bar to toggle the breakpoints. This allows you to set or delete
a breakpoint.
<P>
Refer to <A HREF="318_L4_BreakpointsMenuChoic.html">Breakpoints Menu Choices
</A>for more information on breakpoints.
