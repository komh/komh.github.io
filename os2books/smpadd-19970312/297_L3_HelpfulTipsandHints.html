<H1>Helpful Tips and Hints</H1><!-- entering slot 310 -->
<P>
The following are tips and hints that may be helpful:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You must have OS/2 WARP 3.0, OS/2 Warp Connect, or
OS/2 Warp Server for SMP on your host machine.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If CAT_HOST_BIN_PATH points to a remote-mounted drive,
the drive must be mounted in binary mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Put any environment variables that you want set in
a command file. For example, you could put them in the SETICAT.CMD file
or create your own command file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The DBGSTRIP utility can be used to strip debug information
from binaries placed on the victim machine but should not be used on binaries
placed in CAT_HOST_BIN_PATH (if you want to do source-level debugging).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Using C and C++, you can write your program code with
stylistic features that are not supported by the debugger. For example,
multiple statements on the same line are difficult to debug. None of the
individual statements can be accessed separately when you set breakpoints
or when you use step commands.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
ICAT allows you to manipulate any thread running on the victim machine.
Because certain portions of the address space are not shared by all threads,
you must be sure that you are in the proper context when you set breakpoints,
display storage, etc.  The title of a thread-specific window includes the
thread's identifier as shown in the Debug Session Control window (see <A HREF="309_L3_UsingtheDebugSession.html">Using
the Debug Session Control Window</A>). To ensure you are in the context
of the proper thread, select the thread from the Debug Session Control window's
Threads pane.
<P>
For example, suppose you attach to the victim system and wish to set a breakpoint.
 If the breakpoint is in a shared region (for example, in a device driver,
a DLL, or the kernel), it does not matter which context you are in when
you set the breakpoint.  But if the breakpoint is not in a shared region
such as in an EXE file, you must ensure that you are in the context of a
thread that belongs to the process that owns the region before you set the
breakpoint.  Because the debugger does not necessarily have information
about every EXE file in the system, a window may show source for a module
even though the thread listed in the title of the window is not part of
the process that is running the EXE file. If you set the breakpoint without
first verifying you are in the proper context, you will actually set a breakpoint
in a different module entirely.
