<H1>Differences Between TRACE and STRACE</H1><!-- entering slot 512 -->
<P>
There may be some confusion between the existing OS/2 Trace facility and
the new software tracing provided by STRACE, especially since STRACE uses
the OS/2 Trace facility control utility.  First the OS/2 Trace facility
will be described, then the differences between it and software tracing
will be outlined.
<P>
