<UL> Start
a processor.
<P>
This function is used to start a specified processor. The PSD may only start
the processor that was specified.
<P>
OS/2 fills in the address of a started processors initial real mode CS:IP
in the warm reboot vector of the BIOS data area (0x40:0x67).
<P>
OS/2 provides serialization such that another processor will not be started
until the previous processor has finished its real mode initialization,
gone into protect mode, and finished calling the ProcInit function. The
processor which is started will be held in real mode until the StartProc
function has been completed, and will then be allowed to initialize.
<P>
All processors are started before the first device driver is loaded.

<UL> If the hardware
implementation uses some other mechanism to indicate a started processors
initial CS:IP the value specified in the warm reboot vector should be used.

<P>
If the hardware implementation requires some other real mode operation to
be completed before the processor can continue to execute, the PSD developer
must be certain to chain to the address specified in the warm reboot vector.
