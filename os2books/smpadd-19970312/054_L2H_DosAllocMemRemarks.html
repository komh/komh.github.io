<H1>DosAllocMem - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 58 -->
<P>
DosAllocMem can be used to reserve, or reserve and commit, linear address
space for a private memory object.
<P>
The operating system allocates a range of private pages large enough to
fulfill the specified allocation request from the private virtual-address
space of the subject process. The base address of the object is returned
in the<I> ppb</I> parameter.
<P>
The allocated memory object is rounded up to a multiple of 4KB in size.

<P>
The committed memory allocated by DosAllocMem can be swapped.
<P>
Any access protection can be applied to committed pages within a private
memory object. Committed pages are initially allocated and backed by demand
pages. The first attempt to read or write the page causes a page of zeros
to be created.
<P>
If a failure occurs during the allocation, no pages are allocated, and an
appropriate error code is returned.
<P>
With the Intel 80386 processor, execute and read access are equivalent.
Also, write access implies both read and execute access.
<P>
The guard-page attribute is intended to provide automatic stack-growth and
stack-limit checking. An application may also use it in other data structures.

<P>
Reserved pages that are not committed are given an access protection of
"no access".
