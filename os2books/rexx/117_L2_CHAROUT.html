<P>
CHAROUT returns the count of characters remaining after attempting to write
<I>string</I> to the character output stream<I> name</I>. The form of the
<I>name</I> is implementation dependent. If<I> name</I> is omitted, characters
in<I> string</I> will be written to the default output stream, STDOUT: (normally
the display) in the OS/2 operating system.<I> string</I> can be the null
string, in which case no characters are written to the stream and 0 is always
returned.
<P>
For persistent streams, a write position is maintained for each stream.
In the OS/2 implementation, this is the same as the read position. Any write
to the stream starts at the current write position by default.  When the
write is completed the write position is increased by the number of characters
written.  The initial write position is the end of the stream, so that calls
to CHAROUT normally append to the end of the stream.
<P>
A<I> start</I> value can be given to specify an explicit write position
for a persistent stream. This write position must be a positive whole number
within the bounds of the stream (though it can specify the character position
immediately after the end of the stream). A value of 1 for<I> start</I> refers
to the first character in the stream.
<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> In some environments, overwriting a stream with CHAROUT or LINEOUT
can erase (destroy) all existing data in the stream. However, this is not
the case in the OS/2 environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
The<I> string</I> can be omitted for persistent streams. In this case, the
write position is set to the value of<I> start</I> that was given, no characters
are written to the stream, and 0 is returned. If neither<I> start</I> nor
<I>string</I> are given, the write position is set to the end of the stream.
This use of CHAROUT can also have the side effect of closing or fixing the
file in environments which support this concept.  Again, 0 is returned.
If you do not specify<I> start</I> or<I> string</I>, the stream is closed.
Again, 0 is returned.
<P>
Processing of the program normally stops until the output operation is effectively
complete. If, however, it is impossible for all the characters to be written,
the NOTREADY condition is raised and CHAROUT returns with the number of
characters that could not be written (the residual count).
<P>
Here are some examples:
<PRE>CHAROUT(myfile,'Hi')     <B>-&gt;</B>   0   /* normally */
CHAROUT(myfile,'Hi',5)   <B>-&gt;</B>   0   /* normally */
CHAROUT(myfile,,6)       <B>-&gt;</B>   0   /* now at char 6 */
CHAROUT(myfile)          <B>-&gt;</B>   0   /* at end of stream */
CHAROUT(,'Hi')           <B>-&gt;</B>   0   /* normally */
CHAROUT(,'Hello')        <B>-&gt;</B>   2   /* maybe */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> This routine is often best called as a subroutine. The residual
count is then available in the variable RESULT.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
For example:
<PRE>Call CHAROUT myfile,'Hello'
Call CHAROUT myfile,'Hi',6
Call CHAROUT myfile
