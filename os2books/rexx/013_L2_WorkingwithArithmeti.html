<H1>Working with Arithmetic</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
Your REXX procedures may need to include arithmetic operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.  For example, you may want to
assign a numeric value to two variables and then add the variables.
<P>
Arithmetic operations are performed the usual way.  You can use whole numbers
and decimal fractions.  A whole number is an integer, or any number that
is a natural number, either positive, negative, or zero, that does not contain
a decimal part (for example, 1, 25, or 50).  A decimal fraction contains
a decimal point (for example, 1.45 or 0.6).
<P>
Before you see how these four operations are handled in a procedure, here
is an explanation of what the operations look like and the symbols used.
 These are just a few of the arithmetic operations used in REXX.
<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> The examples contain a blank space between numbers and operators
so that you can see the equations better, but the blank is optional.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
<B>Operators</B> - The symbols used for arithmetic (+ , -, *, /) are called
operators because they operate on the adjacent terms.  In the following
example, the<I> operators</I> act on the numbers (terms) 4 and 2:
<PRE>SAY 4 + 2             /* says "6" */
SAY 4 * 2             /* says "8" */
SAY 4 / 2             /* says "2" */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Addition</B> - The operator for addition is the plus sign (+).  An instruction
to add two numbers is:
<PRE>SAY 4 + 2
</PRE>

<P>
The answer you see on your screen is 6.
<P>
<B>Subtraction</B> - The operator for subtraction is the minus sign (-).
 An instruction to subtract two numbers is:
<PRE>SAY 8 - 3
</PRE>

<P>
The answer on your screen is 5.
<P>
<B>Multiplication</B> - The operator for multiplication is the asterisk
(*).  An instruction to multiply two numbers is:
<PRE>SAY 2 * 2
</PRE>

<P>
The answer on your screen is 4.
<P>
<B>Division</B> - For division, there are several operators you can use,
depending on whether or not you want the answer expressed as a whole number.
 For example, for a simple division, the symbol is one slash (/). An instruction
to divide is:
<PRE>SAY 7 / 2
</PRE>

<P>
The answer on your screen is 3.5.
<P>
To divide and return just a remainder, the operator is two slashes (//).
 To divide, and return only the whole number portion of an answer and no
remainder, the operator is the percent sign (%).
<P>

select the Examples pushbutton.
<P>
<B>Evaluating Expressions</B> - Expressions are normally evaluated from
left to right.  An equation helps to illustrate this point.  Until now,
you have seen equations with only one operator and two terms, such as 4 + 2.
 Suppose you had this equation:
<PRE>9 - 5 + 4 =
</PRE>

<P>
The 9 - 5 would be computed first.  The answer, 4, would be added to 4 for
a final value: 8.
<P>
Some operations are given priority over others.  In general, the rules of
algebra apply to equations.  In this equation, the division is handled before
the addition:
<PRE>10 + 8 / 2 =
</PRE>

<P>
The value is 14.
<P>
If you use parentheses in an equation, the interpreter evaluates what is
in the parentheses first.  For example:
<PRE>(10 + 8) / 2 =
</PRE>

<P>
The value is 9.
