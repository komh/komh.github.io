<P>
A<I> string</I> is any group of characters inside single or double quotation
marks.  Either type of quotation marks can be used, but the beginning and
the ending mark must match.  The interpreter stops interpreting when it
sees a quotation mark and the characters that follow remain as they were
typed, with uppercase and lowercase letters.  The interpreter resumes interpreting
when it sees a matching quotation mark.  For example:
<PRE>'The Greatest Show on Earth'
"The President leads his country"
</PRE>

<P>
are both strings.
<P>
To use an apostrophe (single quotation mark) or double quotation marks within
a string, use the other quotation mark around the whole string.  For example:

<PRE>"Don't count your chickens before they hatch."
</PRE>

<P>
or
<PRE>'Do not count your "chickens" before they hatch.'
</PRE>

<P>
You also can use a pair of quotation marks (the same as those used to mark
the string) as follows:
<PRE>SAY "Mary said  ""He's here."""
</PRE>

<P>
This is interpreted by REXX as:
<PRE>Mary said  "He's here."
</PRE>
