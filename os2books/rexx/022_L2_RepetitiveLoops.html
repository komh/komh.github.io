<H1>Repetitive Loops</H1><!-- entering slot 22 -->
<P>
Simple repetitive loops can be run a number of times.  You can specify the
number of repetitions for the loop, or you can use a variable that has a
changing value.
<P>
The following shows how to repeat a loop a fixed number of times.
<PRE>DO num
   instruction1
   instruction2
   instruction3
   ...
END
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> num</I> is a whole number, which is the number of times the loop
is to be run.
<P>
Here is LOOP.CMD, an example of a simple repetitive loop.
<PRE>/* A simple loop */
DO 5
   SAY 'Thank-you'
END
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When you run the LOOP.CMD, you see this on your screen:
<PRE>[C:\]loop
Thank-you
Thank-you
Thank-you
Thank-you
Thank-you

[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
Another type of DO instruction is:
<PRE>DO XYZ = 1 to 10
</PRE>

<P>
This type of DO instruction numbers each pass through the loop so you can
use it as a variable.  The value of XYZ changes (by 1) each time you pass
through the loop.  The<I> 1</I> (or some number) gives the value you want
the variable to have the first time through the loop.  The<I> 10</I> (or
some number) gives the value you want the variable to have the last time
through the loop.
<P>
NEWLOOP.CMD is an example of another loop:
<PRE>/* Another loop */
sum = 0
DO XYZ = 1 to 7
   SAY 'Enter value' XYZ
   PULL value
   sum = sum + value
END
SAY 'The total is' sum
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
Here are the results of the NEWLOOP.CMD procedure:
<PRE>[C:\]newloop
Enter value 1

2

Enter value 2

4

Enter value 3

6

Enter value 4

8

Enter value 5

10

Enter value 6

12

Enter value 7

14

The total is 56

[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
When a loop ends, the procedure continues with the instruction following
the end of the loop, which is identified by END.
