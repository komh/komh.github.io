<P>
LEAVE is used to cause an immediate exit from one or more repetitive DO
loops (that is, any DO construct other than a simple DO loop).
<P>
Processing of the group of instructions is terminated, and control is passed
to the instruction following the END clause as though the END clause had
been encountered and the termination condition had been met normally.  However,
on exit, the control variable, if any, will contain the value it had when
the LEAVE instruction was processed.
<P>
If<I> name</I> is not specified, LEAVE terminates the innermost active repetitive
loop. If<I> name</I> is specified, it must be the name of the control variable
of a currently active loop which may be the innermost loop; that loop (and
any active loops inside it) is then terminated. Control then passes to the
clause following the END clause that matches the DO clause of the selected
loop.
<P>

<PRE>do i=1 to 5
  say i
  if i=3 then leave
  end

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If specified,<I> name</I> must match the one
on the DO instruction in all respects except case. No substitution for compound
variables is carried out when the comparison is made.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A loop is active if it is currently being processed.
If during execution of a loop, a subroutine is called or an INTERPRET instruction
is processed, the loop becomes inactive until the subroutine has returned
or the INTERPRET instruction has completed. LEAVE cannot be used to terminate
an inactive loop.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If more than one active loop uses the same control
variable, the innermost one is the one selected by LEAVE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
