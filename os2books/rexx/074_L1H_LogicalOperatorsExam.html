<P>
The following procedure, AND.CMD, shows the AND operator checking for two
true statements.
<PRE>/* Using the AND (&amp;) Operator   */
/* 0 is false; 1 is true        */
a = 4
b = 2
c = 5
d = (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &gt; c)
SAY 'The result of (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &gt; c) is' d
d = (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &lt; c)
SAY 'The result of (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &lt; c) is' d
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When run on your system, AND.CMD displays the following on your screen as:

<PRE>

[C:\]AND
The result of (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &gt; c) is 0
The result of (a &gt; b) &amp; (b &lt; c) is 1

[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
The following procedure, OR.CMD, shows the OR operator in a true statement
unless both values are false:
<PRE>/* Using the OR (|) Operator    */
/* 0 is false; 1 is true        */
a = 4
b = 2
c = 5
d = (a &gt; b) | (b &gt; c)
SAY 'The result of (a &gt; b) | (b &gt; c) is' d
d = (a &gt; b) | (b &lt; c)
SAY 'The result of (a &gt; b) | (b &lt; c) is' d
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When run on your system, the procedure displays the following:
<PRE>
[C:\]OR
The result of (a &gt; b) | (b &gt; c) is 1
The result of (a &gt; b) | (b &lt; c) is 1

[C:\]
</PRE>
