<H1>The Logical Operators, NOT, AND, OR</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
Logical operators can return only the values of 1 or 0.  The<I> NOT</I> operator
(║Ч or \) in front of a term reverses its value either from true to false
or from false to true.
<PRE>SAY  \ 0         /* gives '1'         */
SAY  \ 1         /* gives '0'         */
SAY  \ (4 = 4)   /* gives '0'         */
SAY  \ 2         /* gives  a  syntax error      */
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> AND</I> operator (&amp;) between two terms gives a value of true
only if both terms are true.
<PRE>
SAY ( 3 = 3 ) &amp; ( 5 = 5 )   /* gives '1'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 4 ) &amp; ( 5 = 5 )   /* gives '0'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 3 ) &amp; ( 4 = 5 )   /* gives '0'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 4 ) &amp; ( 4 = 5 )   /* gives '0'                     */
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> OR</I> operator ( | ) between two terms gives a value of true unless
both terms are false.

<B>аж: </B> Depending upon your Personal System keyboard and the code page
you are using, you may not have the solid vertical bar to select. For this
reason, REXX also recognizes the use of the split vertical bar as a logical
OR symbol.  Some keyboards may have both characters.  If so, they are not
interchangeable; only the character that is equal to the ASCII value of
124 works as the logical OR.  This type of mismatch can also cause the character
on your screen to be different from the character on your keyboard.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<PRE>SAY ( 3 = 3 ) | ( 5 = 5 )   /* gives '1'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 4 ) | ( 5 = 5 )   /* gives '1'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 3 ) | ( 4 = 5 )   /* gives '1'                     */
SAY ( 3 = 4 ) | ( 4 = 5 )   /* gives '0'                     */
</PRE>
