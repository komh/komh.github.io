A batch file contains a series of commands that you would enter, one at
a time, at a command prompt for a particular process.  Instead, you simply
type the name of the file.  Using a batch file shortens process time and
reduces the possibility of typing errors.  Batch files in DOS sessions have
a .BAT extension and in OS/2 sessions a .CMD extension.  For more information
about batch files, see the<I> Command Reference</I>.
