<P>
RETURN is used to return control (and possibly a result) from a REXX program
or internal routine to the point of its invocation.
<P>
If no internal routine (subroutine or function) is active, RETURN and EXIT
are identical in their effect on the program that is being run.
<P>
If a<I> subroutine</I> is being processed (see the CALL instruction),<I> expression
</I>(if any) is evaluated, control passes back to the caller, and the REXX
special variable RESULT is set to the value of<I> expression</I>. If<I> expression
</I>is omitted, the special variable RESULT is dropped (becomes uninitialized).
The various settings saved at the time of the CALL (tracing, addresses,
and so on) are also restored.
<P>
If a<I> function</I> is being processed, the action taken is identical,
except that<I> expression</I> must be specified on the RETURN instruction.
The result of<I> expression</I> is then used in the original expression
at the point where the function was invoked.
<P>
If a PROCEDURE instruction was processed within the routine (subroutine
or internal function), all variables of the current generation are dropped
(and those of the previous generation are exposed) after<I> expression</I> is
evaluated and before the result is used or assigned to RESULT.
