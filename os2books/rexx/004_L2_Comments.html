<H1>Comments</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
All REXX procedures must begin with a<I> comment</I> starting in column
one of line one.  The comment tells the command interpreter it is about
to read and run a REXX procedure. The symbols for a comment are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->To mark the start of a comment<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->To mark the end of a comment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
When the interpreter finds a /*, it stops interpreting; when it encounters
a */, it begins interpreting again with the information following the symbol.
 The comment can be a few words, no words, or several lines, as in the following
examples:
<PRE>/* This is a comment. */
</PRE>

<P>
or,
<PRE>SAY "'Be Prepared!'" /* This comment is on the same line
as the instruction and continues on to the next line */
</PRE>

<P>
You can use only /* */ to start a REXX procedure, but it is better to put
a brief description of the procedure between the comment symbols.
<P>
The comment can indicate the purpose of the procedure, the kind of input
it can handle, and the kind of output it produces. Comments help you understand
the procedure when you read it later, perhaps to add to it, improve it,
or use it elsewhere in the same procedure or another procedure.
<P>
When you write procedures, remember that others may need to use or modify
them.  It is a good idea to add comments to the instructions so that anyone
can understand each step.  If you do not use a procedure often, it is helpful
to have reminders to aid your memory. In general, explain your procedure
well enough so that others can understand it.
