<P>
TRACE is used for debugging.  It controls the tracing action taken (that
is, how much is displayed to the user) during execution of a REXX program.
 The syntax of TRACE is more concise than other REXX instructions.  The
economy of key strokes for this instruction is especially convenient since
TRACE is usually entered manually during interactive debugging.
<P>
The<I> number</I> is a whole number.
<P>
The<I> string</I> or<I> expression</I> evaluates to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A number option<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>One of the valid prefix, alphabetic character
(word) options, or both, shown in this panel<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Null.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<I> symbol</I> is taken as a constant and is:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A number option<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>One of the valid prefix, alphabetic character
(word) options, or both, shown in this panel.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The tracing action is determined from the option specified following TRACE
or from the result of evaluating<I> expression</I>. If<I> expression</I> is
used, you can omit the subkeyword VALUE as long as<I> expression</I> starts
with a special character or operator (so it is not mistaken for a symbol
or string).
<P>
<B>Alphabetic Character (Word) Options</B>
<P>
Although it is acceptable to enter the word in full, only the uppercase
letter is significant; all other letters are ignored. That is why these
are referred to as alphabetic character options.
<P>
TRACE actions correspond to the alphabetic character options as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>All</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> All clauses are traced (that is, displayed)
before execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Commands</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> All
host commands are traced before execution, and any error return code is
displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Error</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Any
host command resulting in an error return code is traced after execution.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Failure</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Any host
command resulting in a failure is traced after execution. This is the same
as the<I> Normal</I> option.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Intermediates</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> All
clauses are traced before execution. Intermediate results during evaluation
of expressions and substituted names are also traced.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Labels
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>Labels passed during execution are traced. This
is especially useful with debug mode, when the language processor pauses
after each label.  It is also convenient for the user to make note of all
subroutine calls and signals.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Normal</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Any
failing host command is traced after execution. This is the default setting.

<P>
For the default CMD processor in the OS/2 operating system, an attempt to
issue an unknown command raises a FAILURE condition. An attempt to issue
a command to an unknown subcommand environment also raises a FAILURE condition;
in such a case, the variable RC is set to 2, the OS/2 return code for "file
not found".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Off</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Nothing
is traced, and the special prefix actions (see below) are reset to OFF.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Results</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> All clauses
are traced before execution.  Final results (contrast with<I> Intermediates</I>,
above) of evaluating an expression are traced.  Values assigned during PULL,
ARG, and PARSE instructions are also displayed.  This setting is recommended
for general debugging.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Prefix Option</B>
<P>
The prefix<I> ?</I> is valid either alone or with one of the alphabetic
character options. You can specify the prefix more than<!-- entering slot 108 --> once,
if desired.  Each occurrence of a prefix on an instruction reverses the
action of the previous prefix. The prefix must immediately precede the option
(no intervening blanks).
<P>
The prefix<I> ?</I> modifies tracing and execution. <I> ?</I> is used to
control interactive debug. During normal execution, a TRACE instruction
prefixed with<I> ?</I> causes interactive debug to be switched on.
<P>
When interactive debug is in effect, you can switch it off by issuing a
TRACE instruction with a prefix<I> ?</I>.  Repeated use of the<I> ?</I> prefix,
therefore, switchs you alternately in and out of interactive debug. Or,
interactive debug can be turned off at any time by issuing TRACE O or TRACE
with no options.
<P>
<B>Numeric Options</B>
<P>
If interactive debug is active<I> and</I> if the option specified is a positive
whole number (or an expression that evaluates to a positive whole number),
that number indicates the number of debug pauses to be skipped over. However,
if the option is a negative whole number (or an expression that evaluates
to a negative whole number), all tracing, including debug pauses, is temporarily
inhibited for the specified number of clauses.
<P>
If interactive debug is not active, numeric options are ignored.
<P>
<B>Format of TRACE Output</B>
<P>

<P>
Every clause traced will be displayed with automatic formatting (indentation)
according to its logical depth of nesting and so on, and the results (if
requested) are indented an extra two spaces and are enclosed in double quotation
marks so that leading and trailing blanks are apparent.
<P>
All lines displayed during tracing have a three-character prefix to identify
the type of data being traced.  The prefixes and their definitions are the
following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I><LI><LI><LI></I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Identifies the source of a single
clause, that is, the data actually in the program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I><LI><LI><LI></I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Identifies a trace message.  This
can be the nonzero return code from a command, the prompt message when interactive
debug is entered, an indication of a syntax error when in interactive debug,
or the traceback clauses after a syntax error in the program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>&gt;&gt;&gt;</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Identifies the result of an
expression (for TRACE R) or the value assigned to a variable during parsing,
or the value returned from a subroutine call.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> &gt;.&gt;
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Identifies the value assigned to a placeholder
during parsing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following prefixes are only used if Intermediates (TRACE I) are being
traced:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>&gt;C&gt;</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The data traced is the name of
a compound variable, traced after substitution and before use, provided
that the name had the value of a variable substituted into it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> &gt;F&gt;
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The data traced is the result of a function
call.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> &gt;L&gt;</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The
data traced is a literal (string, uninitialized variable, or constant symbol).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I>&gt;O&gt;</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The data
traced is the result of an operation on two terms.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> &gt;P&gt;
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The data traced is the result of a prefix operation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I>&gt;V&gt;</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The data
traced is the contents of a variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
