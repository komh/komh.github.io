<H1>SELECT, END, WHEN, OTHERWISE, and NOP Instructions</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->
<P>
SELECT tells the interpreter to select one of a number of instructions.
 It is used only with WHEN, THEN, END, and sometimes, OTHERWISE.  The END
instruction marks the end of every SELECT group.  The SELECT instruction
looks like this:
<PRE>SELECT
   WHEN expression1
      THEN instruction1
   WHEN expression2
      THEN instruction2
   WHEN expression3
      THEN instruction3
...
OTHERWISE
   instruction
   instruction
   instruction
END
</PRE>

<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> An IF-THEN instruction cannot be used with a SELECT instruction
unless it follows a WHEN or OTHERWISE instruction.  You can read this format
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If expression1 is true, instruction1 is run.  After
this, processing continues with the instruction following the END.  The
END instruction signals the end of the SELECT instruction.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If expression1 is false, expression2 is tested.
 Then, if expression2 is true, instruction2 is run and processing continues
with the instruction following the END.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If, and only if, all of the specified expressions
are false, then processing continues with the instruction following OTHERWISE.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
A DO-END instruction could be included inside a SELECT instruction as follows:

<PRE>SELECT   WHEN expression1 THEN
      DO
        instruction1
        instruction2
        instruction3
     END
.

</PRE>

<P>
You can use the SELECT instruction when you are looking at one variable
that can have several different values associated with it.  With each different
value, you can set a different condition.
<P>
For example, suppose you wanted a reminder of weekday activities.  For the
variable<I> day</I>, you can have a value of Monday through Friday.  Depending
on the day of the week (the value of the variable), you can list a different
activity (instruction).  You could use a procedure such as the following,
SELECT.CMD, which chooses from several instructions.
<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> A THEN or ELSE instruction must be followed by an instruction.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<PRE>/* Selecting weekday activities */
SAY 'What day is it today?'
Pull day
SELECT
   WHEN day = 'MONDAY'
      THEN
      SAY 'Model A board meeting'
   WHEN day = 'TUESDAY'
      THEN
      SAY "My Team Meeting"
   WHEN day = 'WEDNESDAY'
      THEN NOP                 /* Nothing happens here */
   WHEN day = 'THURSDAY'
      THEN
      SAY "My Seminar"
   WHEN day = 'FRIDAY'
      THEN
      SAY "My Book Review"
OTHERWISE
   SAY  "It is the weekend, anything can happen!"
END
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
<B>NOP Instruction</B>: If you want nothing to happen for one expression,
use the NOP (No Operation) instruction, as shown in the previous example
for Wednesday.
