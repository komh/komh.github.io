<H1>RXQUEUE Function</H1><!-- entering slot 187 -->
<P>
Use the RxQueue function in a REXX program to create and delete queues and
to set and query their names. The first parameter determines the function,
the entire function name must be specified but the case of the function
parameter is ignored.
<P>
Syntax:

<B>Special Considerations</B><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->External programs that must communicate with
a REXX procedure by means of defined data queues can use the default queue
or the session queue, or they can receive the data queue name by some interprocess
communication technique. This could include parameter passing, placement
on a prearranged logical queue, or use of normal OS/2 Inter-Process Communication
mechanisms (for example, pipes, shared memory or IPC queues).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Named queues are available across the entire
system; therefore, the names of queues must be unique within the system.
 If a queue named<I> os2que</I> exists and this function is issued:
<PRE><B>newqueue = RXQUEUE('Create', 'os2que')</B>
</PRE>

<P>
a new queue is created and the name is chosen by REXX.  This new name is
returned by the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any external program started inherits as its
default queue the queue in use by the parent process.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Detached Processes</B><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Detached processes will access a<I> detached
</I>session queue that is unique for<!-- entering slot 188 --> each detached
process. Note, however, that this detached session queue is<I> not</I> the
same as the session queue of the starting session.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REXX programs that are to be run as detached
processes cannot perform any SAY instructions or any PULL or PARSE PULL
instructions that involve terminal I/O. However, PULL and PARSE PULL instructions
that act on a queue are permitted in detached processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Multi-Programming Considerations</B>
<P>
This data queue mechanism differs from OS/2 standard API queueing in the
following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The queue is NOT owned by a specific process,
and as such any process is entitled to modify the queue at any time.  The
operations that effect the queue are atomic, in that the resource will be
serialized by the subsystem such that no data integrity problems can be
encountered.
<P>
However, synchronization of requests such that two processes, accessing
the same queue, get the data in the order it was placed on the queue is
a user responsibility and will<I> not</I> be provided by the subsystem support
code. This selector is owned by the calling application code and must be
freed by the caller using DosFreeSeg.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A regular OS/2 IPC queue is owned (created) by
a specific process. When that process terminates, the queue is destroyed.
Conversely, the queues created by the<I> RxQueue('Create', queuename</I>)
call will exist until EXPLICITLY deleted. Termination of a program or procedure
that created a private queue does not force the deletion of the private
queue. Any data on the queue when the process<I> creating</I> it terminates
will remain on the queue until either the queue is deleted (by way of the
REXX function call<I> RxQueue('Create', queuename</I>) or until the data
is read.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Data queues<I> must be explicitly deleted</I> by some procedure or program
(not necessarily the creator). Deletion of a queue with remaining items,
destroys those items. If a queue is not deleted, it will be lost and cannot
be recovered except by randomly attempting to access each queue in the defined
series.
