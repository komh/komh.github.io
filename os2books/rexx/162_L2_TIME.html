<PRE> ──TIME(─┬────────┬─)─────
           └─option─┘
</PRE>

<P>
TIME returns the local time in the 24-hour clock format<I> hh:mm:ss</I> (hours,
minutes, and seconds) by default; for example:
<PRE>04:41:37
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the following options (for which only the capitalized letter
is needed) to obtain alternative formats, or to gain access to the elapsed-time
clock:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Civil</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns hh:mmxx, the time in Civil
format, in which the hours may take the values 1 through 12, and the minutes
the values 00 through 59.  The minutes are followed immediately by the letters
"am" or "pm" to distinguish times in the morning (midnight 12:00am through
11:59am) from noon and afternoon (noon 12:00pm through 11:59pm).  The hour
will not have a leading zero.  The minute field shows the current minute
(rather than the nearest minute) for consistency with other TIME results.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Elapsed</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns sssssssss.uu0000,
the number of seconds.hundredths since the elapsed time clock was started
or reset (see below). The returned number has no leading zeros, but always
has four trailing zeros in the decimal portion. It is not affected by the
setting of NUMERIC DIGITS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Hours</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns
number of hours since midnight in the format hh (no leading zeros).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Long
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns time in the format hh:mm:ss.uu0000 (where
uu is the fraction of seconds in hundredths of a second).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Minutes
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns number of minutes since midnight in
the format: mmmm (no leading zeros).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Normal</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns
the time in the default format hh:mm:ss, as described above.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Reset
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns sssssssss.uu0000, the number of seconds.hundredths
since the elapsed time clock was started or reset (see below) and also resets
the elapsed-time clock to zero. The returned number has no leading zeros,
but always has four trailing zeros in the decimal portion.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Seconds
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns number of seconds since midnight in
the format sssss (no leading zeros).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Here are some examples:
<PRE>TIME('L')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '16:54:22.120000'   /* Perhaps */TIME()       <B>-&gt;</B>   '16:54:22'
TIME('H')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '16'
TIME('M')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '1014'           /* 54 + 60*16 */
TIME('S')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '60862'  /* 22 + 60*(54+60*16) */
TIME('N')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '16:54:22'
TIME('C')    <B>-&gt;</B>   '4:54pm'
</PRE>

<P>
<B>The Elapsed-Time Clock</B>
<P>
The elapsed-time clock may be used for measuring real time intervals. On
the first call to the elapsed-time clock, the clock is started, and both
<I>TIME('E')</I> and<I> TIME('R')</I> will return 0.
<P>
The clock is saved across internal routine calls, which is to say that an
internal routine inherits the time clock its caller started.  Any timing
the caller is doing is not affected even if an internal routine resets the
clock.
<P>
Here is an example of the elapsed-time clock:
<PRE>time('E')    <B>-&gt;</B>    0          /* The first call */
/* pause of one second here */
time('E')    <B>-&gt;</B>    1.020000   /* or thereabouts */
/* pause of one second here */
time('R')    <B>-&gt;</B>    2.030000   /* or thereabouts */
/* pause of one second here */
time('R')    <B>-&gt;</B>    1.050000   /* or thereabouts */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> See the DATE function about consistency of times within a single
expression.  The elapsed-time clock is synchronized to the other calls to
TIME and DATE, so multiple calls to the elapsed-time clock in a single expression
always return the same result.  For the same reason, the interval between
two normal TIME and DATE results may be calculated exactly using the elapsed-time
clock.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
<B>Implementation maximum:</B> If the number of seconds in the elapsed time
<!-- entering slot 171 -->exceed nine digits (equivalent to over 31.6 years),
an error will result.
