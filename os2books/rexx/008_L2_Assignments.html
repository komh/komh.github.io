<P>
An<I> assignment</I> tells the system that a string should be put in a special
place in system memory.  In the example:
<PRE>Work = "Building 021"
</PRE>

<P>
the string<I> Building 021</I> is stored as the value<I> Work</I> in system
memory.  Because<I> Work</I> can have different values (be reassigned to
mean different things) in different parts of the procedure, it is called
a Variable<A HREF="011_L2_Variables.html">Reference</A>.
