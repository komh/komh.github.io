<P>
CONDITION returns the condition information associated with the current
trapped condition.  You can request four pieces of information:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The name of the current trapped condition<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Any descriptive string associated with that
condition<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The instruction executed as a result of the
condition trap (CALL or SIGNAL)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The status of the trapped condition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following options (of which only the capitalized letter is needed, all
others are ignored) can be used to obtain the following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>Condition name</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns the name of the current
trapped condition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Returns
any descriptive string associated with the current trapped condition. If
no description is available, a null string is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Instruction
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns the keyword for the instruction executed
when the current condition was trapped.  The keywords are CALL or SIGNAL.
This is the default if you omit<I> option</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Status
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Returns the status of the current trapped condition.
 This can change during execution, and is either:<!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<UL>
<P>
ON - the condition is enabled<!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<P>
OFF - the condition is disabled<!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<P>
DELAY - any new occurrence of the condition is delayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If no condition has been trapped (that is, there is no current trapped condition)
then the CONDITION function returns a null string in all four cases.
<P>
Here are some examples:
<PRE>CONDITION()            <B>-&gt;</B>    'CALL'        /* perhaps */CONDITION('C')         <B>-&gt;</B>    'FAILURE'
CONDITION('I')         <B>-&gt;</B>    'CALL'
CONDITION('D')         <B>-&gt;</B>    'FailureTest'
CONDITION('S')         <B>-&gt;</B>    'OFF'        /* perhaps */
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<B>ÁÖ: </B> The condition information returned by the CONDITION function
is saved and restored across subroutine calls (including those caused by
a CALL ON condition trap). Therefore, once a subroutine invoked due to a
CALL ON trap has returned, the current trapped condition reverts to the
current condition before the CALL took place. CONDITION returns the values
it returned before the condition was trapped.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
