<H1>Queue Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 186 -->
<P>
REXX provides queuing services entirely separate from the OS/2 interprocess
communications queues. The queues discussed here are solely for the use
of REXX programs.
<P>
REXX queues are manipulated within a program by these instructions:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>PUSH</B><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Stacks a string on top of the queue
(LIFO).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> QUEUE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Adds
a string to the tail of the queue (FIFO).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> PULL
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>Reads a string from the head of the queue. If
the queue is empty, input is taken from the console (STDIN:).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To get the number of items remaining in the queue, use the function QUEUED.

<P>
<B>Access to Queues</B>
<P>
There are two kinds of queues in REXX. Both kinds are accessed and processed
by name.
<P>
<B>Session Queues</B> - One<I> session queue</I> is automatically provided
for each OS/2 session in operation. Its name is always SESSION, and it is
created by REXX the first time information is put on the queue by a program
or procedure. All processes (programs and procedures) in a session can access
the session queue. However, a given process can only access the session
queue defined for its session, and the session queue is not unique to any
single process in the session.
<P>
<B>Private Queues</B> -<I> Private queues</I> are created (and deleted)
by your program. You can name the queue yourself or leave the naming to
REXX. In order for your program to use any queue, it must know the name
of the queue.
