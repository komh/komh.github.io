<PRE> ─ENDLOCAL()─────────────
</PRE>

<P>
ENDLOCAL restores the drive directory and environment variables in effect
before the last SETLOCAL function was executed. If ENDLOCAL is not included
in a procedure, then the initial environment saved by SETLOCAL will be restored
upon exiting the procedure.
<P>
ENDLOCAL returns a value of 1 if the initial environment is successfully
restored, and a value of 0 if no SETLOCAL has been issued or if the actions
is otherwise unsuccessful.
<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> Unlike their counterparts in the OS/2 Batch language (the Setlocal
and Endlocal statements), the REXX SETLOCAL and ENDLOCAL functions can be
nested.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Here is an example:
<PRE>n = SETLOCAL()          /* saves the current environment    */

         /* The program can now change environment   */
         /* variables (with the VALUE function) and  */
         /* then work in that changed envirnonment.  */

n = ENDLOCAL()          /* restores the initial environment */
</PRE>

<P>
For additional examples, view the SETLOCAL function.
