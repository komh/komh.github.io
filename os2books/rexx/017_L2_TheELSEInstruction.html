<H1>The ELSE Instruction</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
ELSE identifies the instruction to be run if the expression is false.  To
tell the interpreter to select from one of two possible instructions, use:

<PRE>IF expression
 THEN instruction1
ELSE instruction2
</PRE>

<P>
You could include the IF-THEN-ELSE format in a procedure like this:
<PRE>IF answer = 'YES'
 THEN SAY 'OK!'
ELSE SAY 'why not?'
</PRE>
Try the next example, GOING.CMD, to see how choosing between two instructions
works.
<PRE>/* Using IF-THEN-ELSE */
SAY "Are you going to the meeting?"
PULL answer
IF answer = "YES"
 THEN
 SAY "I'll look for you."
ELSE
 SAY "I'll take notes for you."
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When this procedure is run, this is what you will see on your screen:
<PRE>[C:\]GOING
Are you going to the meeting?

yes

I'll look for you.

[C:\]
</PRE>
