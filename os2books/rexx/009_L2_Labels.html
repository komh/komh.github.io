<P>
A<I> label</I> is any word that is followed by a colon (with no space between
the word and the colon) and is not in quotation marks.  For example:
<PRE>MYNAME:
</PRE>

A label marks the start of a subroutine.  The following example shows one
use of a label (called<I> error</I>) within a procedure:
<PRE>  .

IF problem  = 'yes' then SIGNAL error
  .

  .
error:
   SAY 'Problem in your data'
   EXIT
</PRE>
