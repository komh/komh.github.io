<P>
INTERPRET is used to process instructions that have been built dynamically
by evaluating<I> expression</I>.
<P>
The<I> expression</I> is evaluated, and is then processed (interpreted)
as though the resulting string was a line inserted into the input file (and
bracketed by a DO; and an END;).
<P>
Any instructions (including INTERPRET instructions) are allowed, but note
that constructions such as DO ... END and SELECT ... END must be complete.
For example, a string of instructions being interpreted cannot contain a
LEAVE or ITERATE instruction (valid only within a repetitive DO loop) unless
it also contains the whole repetitive DO ... END construct.
<P>
A semicolon is implied at the end of the expression during processing, as
a service to the user.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>data='FRED'
interpret data '= 4'
/* Will a) build the string  "FRED = 4"         */
/*      b) execute  FRED = 4;                   */
/* Thus the variable "FRED" will be set to "4"  */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>data='do 3; say "Hello there!"; end'
interpret data        /* Would display:         */
                      /*  Hello there!          */
                      /*  Hello there!          */
                      /*  Hello there!          */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Notes:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Labels within the interpreted string are not
permanent and are therefore ignored. Therefore, executing a SIGNAL instruction
from within an interpreted string causes immediate exit from that string
before the label search begins.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you are new to the concept of the INTERPRET
instruction and are getting results that you do not understand, you might
find that executing the instruction with TRACE R or TRACE I set is helpful.

<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* Here we have a small program. */
Trace Int
name='Kitty'
indirect='name'
interpret 'say "Hello"' indirect'"!"'
</PRE>

<P>
when run, the following trace is displayed:
<P>

<PRE>[C:\]kitty
kitty
     3 *-* name='Kitty'
       &gt;L&gt;   "Kitty"
     4 *-* indirect='name'
       &gt;L&gt;   "name"
     5 *-* interpret 'say "Hello"' indirect'"!"'
       &gt;L&gt;   "say "Hello""
       &gt;V&gt;   "name"
       &gt;O&gt;   "say "Hello" name"
       &gt;L&gt;   ""!""
       &gt;O&gt;   "say "Hello" name"!""
       *-*  say "Hello" name"!"
       &gt;L&gt;    "Hello"
       &gt;V&gt;    "Kitty"
       &gt;O&gt;    "Hello Kitty"
       &gt;L&gt;    "!"
       &gt;O&gt;    "Hello Kitty!"
Hello Kitty!

<P>
Lines 3 and 4 set the variables used in line 5. Execution of line 5 then
proceeds in two stages. First the string to be interpreted is built up,
using a literal string, a variable (<I>INDIRECT</I>), and another literal.
The resulting pure character string is then interpreted, as though it were
actually part of the original program. Since it is a new clause, it is traced
as such (the second *-* trace flag under line 5) and is then executed. Again
a literal string is concatenated to the value of a variable (<I>NAME</I>)
and another literal, and the final result is then displayed as follows:

<PRE>Hello Kitty!
</PRE>

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For many purposes, the VALUE function can be
used instead of the INTERPRET instruction.  Line 5 in the last example could
therefore have been replaced by:
<PRE>say "Hello" value(indirect)"!"
</PRE>

<P>
INTERPRET is usually only required in special cases, such as when more than
one statement is to be interpreted at once.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
