To stop most REXX procedures, press the Ctrl+Break keys. REXX recognizes
Ctrl+Break after finishing the current instruction. Occasionaly, if you
try a procedure such as the one that follows, you need to press Ctrl+Break
and then Enter to get out of the loop.
<PRE>/* Guess the secret password !  */
DO UNTIL answer = "Sesame"
   SAY "Please enter the password . . ."
   PULL answer
END
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
If you are still unable to end the procedure, press the Alt+Esc keys to
end the OS/2 session and stop the procedure.
