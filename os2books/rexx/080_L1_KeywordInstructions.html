<H1>Keyword Instructions</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
A<I> keyword instruction</I> is one or more clauses, the first of which
starts with a keyword that identifies the instruction.  If the instruction
has more than one clause, the clauses are separated by a delimiter, in this
case a semicolon (;).
<P>
Some keyword instructions, such as those starting with the keyword DO, can
include nested instructions.
<P>
In the syntax diagrams, symbols (words) in upper case letters denote keywords;
other words (such as<I> expression</I>) denote a collection of symbols.
Keywords are not case dependent: the symbols<I> if</I>,<I> If</I>, and<I> iF
</I>would all invoke the instruction<I> IF</I>. Also, you usually omit most
of the clause delimiters (;) shown because they are implied by the end of
a line.
