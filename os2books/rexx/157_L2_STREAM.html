<P>
STREAM returns a string describing the state of, or the result of an operation
upon, the character stream<I> name</I>. This function is used to request
information on the state of an input or output stream, or to carry out some
specific operation on the stream.
<P>
The first argument,<I> name</I>, specifies the stream to be accessed. The
second argument can be one of the following strings (of which only the first
letter is needed) which describes the action to be carried out:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Command</B><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> an operation (specified by the<I> streamcommand
</I>given as the third argument) to be applied to the selected input or
output stream. The string that is returned depends on the command performed,
and can be the null string.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Also
returns the current state of the specified stream. It is identical to the
State operation, except that the returned string is followed by a colon
and, if available, additional information about ERROR or NOTREADY states.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>State</B><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Returns a string
that indicates the current state of the specified stream. This is the default
operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When used with the State option, STREAM returns one of the following strings:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B><LI>ERROR'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> The stream has been subject to
an erroneous operation (possibly during input, output, or through the STREAM
function. Additional information about the error may be available by invoking
the STREAM function with a request for the implementation-dependent description.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>'NOTREADY'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> The stream
is known to be in a state such that normal input or output operations attempted
upon it would raise the NOTREADY condition. For example, a simple input
stream may have a defined length; an attempt to read that stream (with the
CHARIN or LINEIN built-in functions, perhaps) beyond that limit may make
the stream unavailable until the stream has been closed, for example, with
LINEIN(<I>name</I>), and then reopened.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> 'READY'
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>The stream is known to be in a state such that
normal input or output operations can be attempted.  This is the usual state
for a stream, though it does not guarantee that any particular operation
will succeed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> 'UNKNOWN'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> The
state of the stream is unknown. In OS/2 implementations, this generally
means that the stream is closed (or has not yet been opened). However, this
response can be used in other environments to indicate that the state of
the stream cannot be determined.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>주: </B> The state (and operation) of an input or output stream is global
to a REXX program, in that it is not saved and restored across function
and subroutine calls (including those caused by a CALL ON condition trap).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
<B>Stream Commands</B>
<P>
The following stream commands are used to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Open a stream for reading or writing<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Close a stream at the end of an operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Position the read or write position within
a persistent stream (for example, a file)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Get information about a stream (its existence,
size, and last edit date).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<I> streamcommand</I> argument must be used when you select the operation
C (command). The syntax is:
<PRE> 컴STREAM(name,'C',streamcommand)컴컴</PRE>

<P>
In this form, the STREAM function itself returns a string corresponding
to the given<I> streamcommand</I> if the command is successful. If the command
is unsuccessful, STREAM returns an error message string in the same form
as that supplied by the D (Description) operation.
<P>
<B>Command strings</B> - The argument<I> streamcommand</I> can be any expression
that REXX evaluates as one of the following command strings:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B><LI><!-- entering slot 165 -->OPEN'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Opens
the named stream. The default for 'OPEN' is to open the stream for both
reading and writing data. To specify whether<I> name</I> is only to be read
or only to be written to, add the word<I> READ</I> or<I> WRITE</I> to the
command string.
<P>
The STREAM function itself returns 'READY' if the named stream is successfully
opened or an appropriate error message if unsuccessful.
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>
<PRE>stream(strout,'c','open')
stream(strout,'c','open write')
stream(strinp,'c','open read')
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>'CLOSE'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Closes the
named stream. The STREAM function itself returns<I> 'READY'</I> if the named
stream is successfully closed or an appropriate error message otherwise.
If an attempt is made to close an unopened file, then STREAM() returns a
null string ("").
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>stream('STRM.TXT','c','close')
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>'SEEK'</B><I> offset</I><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Sets
the read or write position a given number (<I>offset</I>) within a persistent
stream.
<P>
<B>주: </B> In OS/2, the read and write positions are the same. To use this
command, the named stream must first be opened (with the 'OPEN' stream command,
described previously).<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --> The<I> offset</I> number can be
preceded by one of the following characters:<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<P>
<B><LI></B><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->Explicitly specifies the<I> offset</I> from
the beginning of the stream.  This is the default if no prefix is supplied.
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<P>
<B>&lt;</B><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Specifies<I> offset</I> from the end
of the stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL><B> +</B><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Specifies
<I>offset</I> forward from the current read or write position.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL><B> -
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Specifies<I> offset</I> backward from the current
read or write position.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> The STREAM function itself
returns the new position in the stream if the read or write position is
successfully located; an appropriate error message is displayed otherwise.

<P>
<B>Examples:</B>
<PRE>stream(name,'c','seek =2')
stream(name,'c','seek +15')
stream(name,'c','seek -7')
fromend  = 125
stream(name,'c','seek &lt;'fromend)
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Used with these stream commands, the STREAM function returns specific
information about a stream<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B><LI>QUERY EXISTS'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Returns the full path specification
of the named stream, if it exists, and a null string otherwise.
<PRE>stream('..\file.txt','c','query exists')</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>'QUERY SIZE'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Returns
the size in bytes of a persistent stream.
<PRE>stream('..\file.txt','c','query size')
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>'QUERY DATETIME'</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Returns
the date and time stamps of a stream.
<PRE>stream('..\file.txt','c','query datetime')
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
