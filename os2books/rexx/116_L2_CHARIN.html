<P>
CHARIN returns a string of up to<I> length</I> characters read from the
character input stream<I> name</I>. The form of the<I> name</I> is implementation
dependent. If<I> name</I> is omitted, characters are read from the default
input stream, STDIN:. The default<I> length</I> is 1.
<P>
For persistent streams, a read position is maintained for each stream. In
the OS/2 operating system, this is the same as the write position. Any read
from the stream will by default start at the current read position.  When
the read is completed, the read position is increased by the number of characters
read.  A<I> start</I> value can be given to specify an explicit read position.
 This read position must be positive and within the bounds of the stream,
and must not be specified for a transient stream ( a port or other serial
device).  A value of 1 for<I> start</I> refers to the first character in
the stream.
<P>
If you specify a<I> length</I> of 0, then the read position will be set
to the value of<I> start</I>, but no characters are read and the null string
is returned.
<P>
In a transient stream, if there are fewer then<I> length</I> characters
available, then execution of the program will normally stop until sufficient
characters do become available.  If, however, it is impossible for those
characters to become available due to an error or other problem, the NOTREADY
condition is raised and CHARIN will return with fewer than the requested
number of characters.
<P>
Here are some examples:
<PRE>CHARIN(myfile,1,3)   <B>-&gt;</B>   'MFC'   /* the first 3     */
                                   /* characters      */
CHARIN(myfile,1,0)   <B>-&gt;</B>   ''      /* now at start    */
CHARIN(myfile)       <B>-&gt;</B>   'M'     /* after last call */
CHARIN(myfile,,2)    <B>-&gt;</B>   'FC'    /* after last call */

/* Reading from the default input (here, the keyboard) */
/* User types 'abcd efg' */
CHARIN( )            <B>-&gt;</B>   'a'      /* default is  */
                                             /* 1 character */
CHARIN(,,5)          <B>-&gt;</B>   'bcd e'

<P>
<B>Note 1:</B>
<P>
CHARIN returns all characters that appear in the stream including control
characters such as line feed, carriage return, and end of file.
<P>
<B>Note 2:</B>
<P>
When CHARIN is used to read from the keyboard, program execution stops until
you press the Enter key.
