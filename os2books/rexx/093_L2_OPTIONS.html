<P>
OPTIONS is used to pass special requests or parameters to the language processor.
 For example, they can be language processor options or they can define
a special character set.
<P>
The<I> expression</I> is evaluated, and the result is examined one word
at a time.  If the words are recognized by the language processor, then
they are obeyed.  Words that are not recognized are ignored and assumed
to be instructions to a different processor.
<P>
The following words are recognized by the language processors:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>ETMODE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Specifies that literal strings containing
double-byte character set (DBCS) characters can be used in the program.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>NOETMODE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Specifies
that literal strings containing DBCS characters cannot be used in the program.
NOETMODE is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> EXMODE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Specifies
that DBCS data in mixed strings is handled on a logical character basis
by instructions, operators and functions. DBCS data integrity is maintained.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>NOEXMODE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Specifies
that any data in strings is handled on a byte basis. The integrity of any
DBCS characters might be lost. NOEXMODE is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Notes:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Because of the scanning procedures of the language
processor, you are advised to place an OPTIONS ETMODE instruction as the
first instruction of a program containing DBCS literal strings.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To ensure proper scanning of a program containing
DBCS literals, type the words ETMODE, NOETMODE, EXMODE, and NOEXMODE as
literal strings (that is, enclosed in quotation marks) in the OPTIONS instruction.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OPTIONS ETMODE and OPTIONS EXMODE settings
are saved and restored across subroutine and function calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The words ETMODE, EXMODE, NOEXMODE, and NOETMODE
can occur several times within the result. The word that takes effect is
determined by the last valid one specified between the pairs ETMODE/NOETMODE
and EXMODE/NOEXMODE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
