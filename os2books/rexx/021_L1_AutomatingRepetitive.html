<H1>Automating Repetitive Tasks - Using Loops</H1><!-- entering slot 21 -->
<P>
If you want to repeat several instructions in a procedure, you can use a
<I>loop</I>.  Loops often are used in programming because they condense
many lines of instructions into a group that can be run more than once.
 Loops make your procedures more concise, and with a loop, you can continue
asking a user for input until the correct answer is given.
<P>
With loops, you can keep adding or subtracting numbers until you want to
stop.  You can define how many times you want a procedure to handle an operation.
 You will see how to use simple loops to repeat instructions in a procedure.

<P>
The two types of loops you may find useful are repetitive loops<A HREF="022_L2_RepetitiveLoops.html">Reference
</A>and conditional loops.<A HREF="023_L2_ConditionalLoops.html">Reference
</A> Loops begin with a DO instruction and end with the END instruction.
 The following is a list of topics in this section:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DO num loop<A HREF="022_L2_RepetitiveLoops.html">Reference</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Repeats
the loop a fixed number of times.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DO i=1 to 10 loop<A HREF="022_L2_RepetitiveLoops.html">Reference
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Numbers each pass through the loop.  Sets a
starting and ending value for the variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DO WHILE<A HREF="023_L2_ConditionalLoops.html">Reference
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Tests for true or false at the top of the loop.
Repeats the loop if true.  If false, continues processing after END.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Do
UNTIL<A HREF="023_L2_ConditionalLoops.html">Reference</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Tests
for true or false at the bottom of the loop. Repeats the loop if false.
 If true, continues processing after END.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LEAVE<A HREF="023_L2_ConditionalLoops.html">Reference
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Causes the interpreter to exit a loop.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DO
FOREVER <A HREF="023_L2_ConditionalLoops.html">Reference</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Repeats
instructions until the user says to quit.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Getting
out of loops<A HREF="024_L2_GettingOutofLoops.html">Reference</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Requires
that you press the Ctrl+Break keys.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Parsing words<A HREF="025_L2_ParsingWords.html">Reference
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Assigns a different variable to each word in
a group.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
