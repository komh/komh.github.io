<P>
ITERATE is used to alter the flow within a repetitive DO loop (that is,
any DO construct other than that with a simple DO loop).
<P>
Processing of the group of instructions stops, and control is passed to
the DO instruction just as though the END clause had been encountered. The
control variable (if any) is incremented and tested, as normal, and the
group of instructions is processed again, unless the loop is terminated
by the DO instruction.
<P>
If<I> name</I> is not specified, ITERATE steps the innermost active repetitive
loop. If<I> name</I> is specified, it must be the name of the control variable
of a currently active loop which may be the innermost loop; this is the
loop that is stepped. Any active loops inside the one selected for iteration
are terminated (as though by a LEAVE instruction).
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>do i=1 to 4
  if i=2 then iterate
  say i
  end
/* Would display the numbers:   1, 3, 4  */

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If specified,<I> name</I> must match the name
on the DO instruction in all respects except case. No substitution for compound
variables is carried out when the comparison is made.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A loop is active if it is currently being processed.
If during execution of a loop, a subroutine is called or an INTERPRET instruction
is processed, the loop becomes inactive until the subroutine has returned
or the INTERPRET instruction has completed. ITERATE cannot be used to step
an inactive loop.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If more than one active loop uses the same control
variable, the innermost loop is the one selected by ITERATE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
