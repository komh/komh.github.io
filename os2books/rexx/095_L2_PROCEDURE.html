<P>
The PROCEDURE instruction can be used within an internal routine (subroutine
or function) to protect all the existing variables by making them unknown
to the instructions that follow. On executing a RETURN instruction, the
original variables environment is restored and any variables used in the
routine (which were not exposed) are dropped.
<P>
The EXPOSE option modifies this.  Any variable specified by<I> name</I> is
exposed, so that any reference to it (including setting and dropping) is
made to the environment of the variables that the caller owns. With the
EXPOSE option, you must specify at least one name, a symbol separated from
any other<I> name</I> with one or more blanks. Optionally, you can enclose
a single<I> name</I> in parentheses to denote a subsidiary variable list.
Any variables not specified by<I> name</I> on a PROCEDURE EXPOSE instruction
are still protected.  Hence, some limited set of the caller's variables
can be made accessible, and these variables can be changed (or new variables
in this set can be created).  All these changes will be visible to the caller
upon RETURN from the routine.
<P>
The variables are exposed in sequence from left to right. It is not an error
to specify a name more than once, or to specify a name that has not been
used as a variable by the caller.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* This is the main program */
j=1; x.1='a'
call toft
say j k m       /* would display "1 7 M" */
exit

toft: procedure expose j k x.j
   say j k x.j  /* would display "1 K a"   */
   k=7; m=3     /* note "M" is not exposed */
   return
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if<I> X.J</I> in the EXPOSE list had been placed before<I> J</I>,
the caller's value of<I> J</I> would not have been visible at that time,
so<I> X.1</I> would not have been exposed.
<P>
If<I> name</I> is enclosed in parentheses (blanks are not necessary either
inside or outside the parentheses but can be added if desired) then, after
that variable is exposed, the value of the variable is immediately used
as a subsidiary list of variables.  This list of variables must follow the
same rules as the main list except that no parentheses or leading or trailing
blanks are allowed. The variables named in a subsidiary list are also exposed
from left to right.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>j=1;k=6;m=9
a ='j k m'
test:procedure expose (a)   /* will expose j, k, and x */
</PRE>

<P>
If a<I> stem</I> is specified in<I> names</I>, all possible compound variables
whose names begin with that stem are exposed. (A<I> stem</I> is a symbol
containing only one period, which is the last character.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>lucky7:Procedure Expose i j a. b.
/* This exposes "I", "J", and all variables whose */
/* names start with "A." or "B."                  */
A.1='7'  /* This will set "A.1" in the caller's   */
         /* environment, even if it did not       */
         /* previously exist.                     */
</PRE>

<P>
Variables can be exposed through several generations of routines, if desired,
by ensuring that they are included on all intermediate PROCEDURE instructions.

<P>
Only one PROCEDURE instruction in each level of routine call is allowed;
all others (and those met outside of internal routines) are in error.
