</A>Procedures Language 2/REXX (referred to as REXX for the rest of this
information) is designated as the <A GROUP=611 HREF="078_L1H_SystemsApplicationAr.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 04 63 02 -->Systems
Application Architecture*</A> Procedures Language for the Office Vision
family of products and the OS/2 operating system.  It was designed to make
programming easier to write and debug.  High-quality programming can now
be achieved using common English words in a natural syntax flow that both
beginning and experienced programmers can understand.
<P>
REXX uses a few powerful, general-purpose programming functions and common
arithmetical abilities, as well as OS/2 commands, within a simple framework.
 Existing batch files can be converted to REXX procedures, with more power
and function.
<P>
REXX files only operate in OS/2 sessions, must have a file name extension
of .CMD, and must start with a comment line (/*....*/).  As in batch files,
it is not necessary to type the .CMD extension to start a REXX procedure.

This online REXX information is designed to acquaint you with the REXX language,
show you some of its features and capabilities, and give you a  basic understanding
of how it works.  The sections from "Getting Started.." to "PMREXX" are
written as an overview, stressing general concept information, while the
sections on "Instructions" and "Functions" include specific information
about all of the instructions and functions that are part of REXX. For more
complete and detailed information about REXX, see the<I> OS/2 Procedures
