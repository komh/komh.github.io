A<I> variable</I> is a piece of data with a varying value. Within a procedure,
each variable is known by a unique name and is always referred to by that
name.
<P>
When you choose a name for a variable, the first character must be one of:

<PRE>A B C...Z ! ? _
</PRE>

<P>
Lowercase letters are also allowed as a first letter.  The interpreter changes
them to uppercase.

The rest of the characters can be any of the preceding characters and also
0 through 9.
