<H1>The REXXTRY Program</H1><!-- entering slot 36 -->
<P>
REXXTRY is a REXX program.  As with other REXX programs, REXXTRY can be
run in an OS/2 full-screen or window session, or with PMREXX.
<P>
You can use REXXTRY to run different REXX instructions and observe the results.
 REXXTRY is also useful when you want to perform a REXX operation only once,
since it is easier than creating, running, and erasing a .CMD file.
<P>
Here are some examples of how to use the REXXTRY command:
<PRE>REXXTRY say 1+2
</PRE>

<P>
The operation is performed and<I> 3</I> is displayed.
<PRE>REXXTRY say 2+3; say 3+4
</PRE>

<P>
<I>5</I> and<I> 7</I> are displayed.
