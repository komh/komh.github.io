<P>
DO is used to group instructions together and optionally to execute them
repetitively. During repetitive execution, a control variable (<I>name</I>)
can be stepped through some range of values.
<P>
<B>Syntax Notes:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The<I> exprr, expri, exprb, exprt,</I> and<I> exprf
</I>options (if any are present) are any expressions that evaluate to a
number. The<I> exprr</I> and<I> exprf</I> options are further restricted
to result in a nonnegative whole number. If necessary, the numbers will
be rounded according to the setting of NUMERIC DIGITS.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
<I>exprw</I> or<I> expru</I> options (if present) can be any expression
that evaluates to 1 or 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
TO, BY, and FOR phrases can be in any order, if used.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
instructions can include assignments, commands, and keyword instructions
(including any of the more complex constructs such as IF, SELECT, and the
DO instruction itself).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
subkeywords TO, BY, FOR, WHILE, and UNTIL are reserved within a DO instruction,
in that they cannot name variables in the expressions but they can be used
as the name of the control variable. FOREVER is similarly reserved, but
only if it immediately follows the keyword DO.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
<I>exprb</I> option defaults to 1, if relevant.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Simple DO Group:</B>
<P>
If neither<I> repetitor</I> nor<I> conditional</I> is given, the construct
merely groups a number of instructions together.  These are executed once.
Otherwise, the group of instructions is a repetitive DO loop, and they are
executed according to the repetitor phrase, optionally modified by the conditional
phrase.
<P>
In the following example, the instructions are executed once.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* The two instructions between DO and END will both *//* be executed if A has the value 3.                 */
If a=3 then Do
            a=a+2
            Say 'Smile!'
            End
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Simple Repetitive Loops:</B>
<P>
If<I> repetitor</I> is omitted but there is a<I> conditional</I> or the
<I>repetitor</I> is FOREVER, the group of instructions will nominally be
executed forever, that is, until the condition is satisfied or a REXX instruction
is executed that ends the loop (for example, LEAVE).
<P>
In the simple form of a repetitive loop,<I> exprr</I> is evaluated immediately
(and must result in a nonnegative whole number), and the loop is then executed
that many times.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* This displays "Hello" five times */
Do 5
  say 'Hello'
  end
</PRE>

<P>
Note that, similar to the distinction between a command and an assignment,
if the first character of<I> exprr</I> is a symbol and the second is an
"=" character, the controlled form of<I> repetitor</I> is expected.
<P>
<B>Controlled Repetitive Loops:</B>
<P>
The controlled form<!-- entering slot 85 --> specifies a control variable,
<I>name</I>, which is assigned an initial value (the result of<I> expri</I>,
formatted as though 0 had been added). The variable is then<I> stepped</I> (that
is, the result of<I> exprb</I> is added at the bottom of the loop) each
time the group of instructions is run. The group is run repeatedly while
the end condition (determined by the result of<I> exprt</I>) is not met.
If<I> exprb</I> is positive or zero, the loop will be terminated when<I> name
</I>is greater than<I> exprt</I>. If negative, the loop is terminated when
<I>name</I> is less than<I> exprt</I>.
<P>
The<I> expri, exprt,</I> and<I> exprb</I> options must result in numbers.
 They are evaluated once only, before the loop begins and before the control
variable is set to its initial value. The default value for<I> exprb</I> is
1. If<I> exprt</I> is omitted, the loop is run indefinitely unless some
other condition terminates it.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>Do I=3 to -2 by -1        /* Would display:   */
  say i                   /*      3           */
  end                     /*      2           */
                          /*      1           */
                          /*      0           */
                          /*      -1          */
                          /*      -2          */
</PRE>

<P>
The numbers do not have to be whole numbers.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>X=0.3                     /* Would display:   */
Do Y=X to X+4 by 0.7      /*     0.3          */
  say Y                   /*     1.0          */
  end                     /*     1.7          */
                          /*     2.4          */
                          /*     3.1          */
                          /*     3.8          */
</PRE>

<P>
The control variable can be altered within the loop, and this may affect
the iteration of the loop. Altering the value of the control variable is
not normally considered good programming practice, though it may be appropriate
in certain circumstances.
<P>
Note that the end condition is tested at the start of each iteration (and
after the control variable is stepped, on the second and subsequent iterations).
Therefore, the group of instructions can be skipped entirely if the end
condition is met immediately. Note also that the control variable is referred
to by name. If, for example, the compound name<B> A.I</B> is used for the
control variable, altering<B> I</B> within the loop causes a change in the
control variable.
<P>
The processing of a controlled loop can be bounded further by a FOR phrase.
In this case,<I> exprf</I> must be given and must evaluate to a nonnegative
whole number. This acts just like the repetition count in a simple repetitive
loop, and sets a limit to the number of iterations around the loop if no
other condition terminates it. Similar to the TO and BY expressions, it
is evaluated once only-when the DO instruction is first executed and before
the control variable is given its initial value. Like the TO condition,
the FOR condition is checked at the start of each iteration.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>Do Y=0.3 to 4.3 by 0.7 for 3  /* Would display:    */
  say Y                       /*     0.3           */
  end                         /*     1.0           */
                              /*     1.7           */
</PRE>

<P>
In a controlled loop, the<I> name</I> describing the control variable can
be specified on the END clause. This<I> name</I> must match<I> name</I> in
the DO clause in all respects except case (note that no substitution for
compound variables is carried out); a syntax error results if it does not.
This enables the nesting of loops to be checked automatically, with minimal
overhead.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>Do K=1 to 10
  ...
  ...
  End k  /* Checks that this is the END for K loop */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> The values taken by the control variable may be affected by
the NUMERIC settings, since normal REXX arithmetic rules apply to the computation
of stepping the control variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
<B>Conditional Phrases (WHILE and UNTIL):</B>
<P>
Any of the forms of<I> repetitor</I> (none, FOREVER, simple, or controlled)
can be followed by a conditional phrase, which may<!-- entering slot 86 --> cause
termination of the loop. If you specify WHILE or UNTIL,<I> exprw</I> or
<I>expru</I>, respectively, is evaluated each time around the loop using
the latest values of all variables (and must evaluate to either 0 or 1).
The group of instructions is repeatedly processed either while the result
is 1 or until the result is 1.
<P>
For a WHILE loop, the condition is evaluated at the top of the group of
instructions; for an UNTIL loop, the condition is evaluated at the bottom,
before the control variable has been stepped.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>Do I=1 to 10 by 2 until i&gt;6
  say i
  end
/* Will display: 1, 3, 5, 7 */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>┴╓: </B> The processing of repetitive loops can also be modified by using
the LEAVE or ITERATE instructions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
