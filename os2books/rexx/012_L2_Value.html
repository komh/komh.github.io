<P>
The value of a variable can change, but the name cannot.  When you name
a variable (give it a<I> value</I>), it is an assignment.  For example,
any statement of the form,
<PRE>symbol = expression
</PRE>

<P>
is an assignment statement.  You are telling the interpreter to compute
what the expression is and put the result into a variable called a<I> symbol</I>.
 It is the same as saying, "Let<I> symbol</I> be made equal to the result
of<I> expression</I>" or every time<I> symbol</I> appears in the text of
a SAY string unprotected by single or double quotation marks, display<I> expression
</I>in its place.  The relationship between a variable and a value is like
that between a post-office box and its contents; The box number does not
change, but the contents of the box may be changed at any time.  Another
example of an assignment is:
<PRE>num1 = 10
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> num1</I> assignment has the same meaning as the word<I> symbol</I> in
the previous example, and the value<I> 10</I> has the same meaning as the
word<I> expression</I>.
<P>
One way to give the variable<I> num1</I> a new value is by adding to the
old value in the assignment:
<PRE>num1 = num1 + 3
</PRE>

<P>
The value of<I> num1</I> has now been changed from 10 to 13.
<P>
A special concept in REXX is that any variable that is not assigned a value
assumes the uppercase version of the variable as its initial value.  For
example, if you write in a procedure,
<PRE>list = 2 20 40
SAY list
</PRE>

<P>
you see this on your screen:
<PRE>2 20 40
</PRE>

<P>
As you can see,<I> list</I> receives the values it is assigned.  But if
you do not assign any value to<I> list</I> and only write,
<PRE>SAY list
</PRE>

<P>
you see this on your screen:
<PRE>LIST
</PRE>

<P>
Here is a simple procedure called VARIABLE.CMD that assigns values to variables:

<PRE>/* Assigning a value to a variable */
a = 'abc'
SAY a
b = 'def'
SAY a b
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When you run the VARIABLE procedure, it looks like this on your screen:

<PRE>[C:\]VARIABLE
abc
abc def

[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
Assigning values is easy, but you have to make sure a variable is not used
unintentionally, as in this example named MEETING.CMD:
<PRE>/* Unintentional interpretation of a variable */
the='no'
SAY Here is the person I want to meet
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
When the procedure is run, it looks like this:
<PRE>[C:\]MEETING
HERE IS no PERSON I WANT TO MEET

[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
To avoid unintentionally substituting a variable for the word, put the sentence
in quotation marks as shown in this example of MEETING.CMD, which assigns
a variable correctly:
<PRE>/* Correct interpretation of a variable the*/
the= 'no'
SAY "Here is the person I want to meet"
EXIT
</PRE>
