<P>
The PULL instruction collects a response and puts it into system memory
as a variable.  PULL also can be used to put each word from a group of words
into a different variable.  In REXX, this is called<I> parsing</I>.  The
variable names used in the next example are:  first, second, third, and
rest.
<PRE>SAY 'Please enter three or more words'
PULL first second third rest
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose you enter this as your response:
<PRE>garbage in garbage out
</PRE>

<P>
When you press the Enter key, the procedure continues.  However, the variables
are assigned as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The variable<I> first</I> is given the value<I> GARBAGE</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
The variable<I> second</I> is given the value<I> IN</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
The variable<I> third</I> is given the value<I> GARBAGE</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
The variable<I> rest</I> is given the value<I> OUT</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In general, each variable receives a word, without blanks, and the last
variable receives the rest of the input, if any, with blanks. If there are
more variables than words, the extra variables are assigned the null, or
empty, value.
