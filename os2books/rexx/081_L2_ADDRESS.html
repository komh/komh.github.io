<P>
Address is used to send a single command to a specified environment, code
an<I> environment</I>, a literal string, or a single symbol, which is taken
to be a constant, followed by an expression. The<I> expression</I> is evaluated,
and the resulting command string is routed to<I> environment</I>. After
the command is executed,<I> environment</I> is set back to whatever it was
before, thus temporarily changing the destination for a single command.

<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>ADDRESS CMD "DIR C:\STARTUP.CMD"   /*   OS/2   */
</PRE>

<P>
If only<I> environment</I> is specified, a lasting change of destination
occurs: all commands that follow (clauses that are neither REXX instructions
nor assignment instructions) will be routed to the given command environment,
until the next ADDRESS instruction is executed. The previously selected
environment is saved.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
Suppose that the environment for a text editor is registered by the name
<I>EDIT</I>:
<PRE>address CMD
'DIR C:\STARTUP.CMD'
if rc=0 then 'COPY STARTUP.CMD *.TMP'
address EDIT
</PRE>

<P>
Subsequent commands are passed to the editor until the next ADDRESS instruction.

<P>
Similarly, you can use the VALUE form to make a lasting change to the environment.
 Here<I> expression1</I> (which may be just a variable name) is evaluated,
and the result forms the name of the environment.  The subkeyword VALUE
can be omitted as long as<I> expression1</I> starts with a special character
(so that it cannot be mistaken for a symbol or string).
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>ADDRESS ('ENVIR'||number)
</PRE>

<P>
With no arguments, commands are routed back to the environment that was
selected before the previous lasting change of environment was made, and
the current environment name is saved. Repeated execution of ADDRESS alone,
therefore, switches the command destination between two environments alternately.
A null string for the environment name (" ") is the same as the default
environment.
