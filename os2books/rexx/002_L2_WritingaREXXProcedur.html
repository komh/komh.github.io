<H1>Writing a REXX Procedure</H1><!-- entering slot 2 -->
<P>
We shall write the following REXX procedure using a text editor. To write
a REXX procedure named HELLO.CMD while using the text editor follow these
instructions:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create a text file named HELLO.CMD.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Type the procedure HELLO.CMD, as follows:
<PRE>/* An introduction to REXX */
SAY "Hello! I am REXX"
SAY "What is your name?"
PULL who
 IF who = ""
  THEN
  SAY "Hello Stranger"
 ELSE
  SAY "Hello" who
EXIT
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Save the file and exit from the text editor.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Now you are ready to run the REXX procedure you have written.  Type the
name of the procedure at the OS/2 command prompt and press Enter.
<PRE>hello</PRE>

<P>
When the procedure pauses, you can either type your name or press Enter
to see the other response.
<P>
A brief description of each part of HELLO.CMD follows:
<P>
<B>/* An introduction to REXX */</B>  A comment explains what the procedure
is about.  A comment starts with a<I> /*</I> and ends with a<I> */</I>.
 All REXX procedures must start with a comment on line one and column one
of the file.  The comment tells the command processor that the procedure
being run is a REXX procedure and distinguishes it from simple batch files.

<P>
<B>SAY "Hello! I am REXX." SAY "What is your name?"</B>  These instructions
cause the words between the quotation marks to be displayed on your screen.

<P>
<B>PULL who</B>  The PULL instruction reads the response entered from the
keyboard and puts it into the system's memory. <I> Who</I> is the name of
the place in memory where the user's response is put.  Any name can be used
with the PULL instruction.
<P>
<B>IF who = " "</B>  The IF instruction tests a condition.  The test in
this example determines if<I> who</I> is empty.  It is empty if the user
types a space and presses Enter or just presses Enter.
<P>
<B>THEN</B>  Specifies that the instruction that follows is to be run, if
the tested condition is true.
<P>
<B>SAY "Hello Stranger"</B>  Displays<I> Hello Stranger</I> on the screen.

<P>
<B>ELSE</B>  Specifies that the instruction that follows is to be run if
the tested condition is not true.
<P>
<B>SAY "Hello" who</B>  Displays<I> Hello</I> on the screen, followed by
whatever is in<I> who</I>.
<P>
<B>EXIT</B>  This instruction causes the procedure to stop.
<P>
Here is what would happen if a person named Bill tried the HELLO program:

<PRE>[C:\]hello
Hello! I am REXX.
What is your name?

Bill

Hello BILL

[C:\]
</PRE>
If Bill does not type his name, but types a blank space, this happens:
<PRE>[C:\]hello
Hello! I am REXX.
What is your name?

Hello Stranger

[C:\]
</PRE>
