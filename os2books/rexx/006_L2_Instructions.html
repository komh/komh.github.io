<P>
An<I> instruction</I> tells the system to do something.  Instructions can
contain one or more assignments, labels, or commands and they usually start
on a new line.  The following are explanations of some of the more common
instructions.
<P>
SAY Instruction - The format for the SAY instruction is:
<PRE>SAY expression
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> expression</I> can be something you want displayed on the screen
or something to be computed, such as an equation:
<PRE>SAY 5 + 6 "= eleven"
</PRE>

<P>
This displays
<PRE>11 = eleven
</PRE>

<P>
With the SAY instruction, anything not in quotation marks is changed to
uppercase or is processed.  If you want something to appear exactly as it
is typed, enclose it in quotation marks.
<P>
PULL and PARSE PULL Instructions -
<P>
In a procedure, the usual sequence of instructions is to use SAY to ask
a question and PULL to receive the answer.  The response typed by the user
is put into system memory.  The following procedure does not work correctly
if the PULL instruction comes before the SAY instruction.
<P>
Question:  What do you think happens when the following procedure, NAME.CMD,
is run?
<PRE>/* Using the PULL Instruction */
SAY "Enter your name"
PULL name          /* Puts response
from user into memory */
SAY "Hello" name
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
Answer:  NAME.CMD puts a name in memory and then displays that name anywhere
in the file that the word<I> name</I> appears without the protection of
single or double quotation marks.
<P>
If you tried the NAME procedure, you probably noticed that your name was
changed to uppercase.  To keep the characters as you type them, use the
PARSE PULL instruction.  Here is an example called CHITCHAT.CMD that uses
the PARSE PULL instruction:
<PRE>/* Using the PARSE PULL Instruction */
SAY "Hello! Are you still there?"
SAY "I forgot your name.  What is it?"
PARSE PULL name
SAY name "Are you going to Richard's seminar?"
PULL answer
IF answer = "YES"
 THEN
 SAY "Good.  See you there!"
IF answer = "NO"
 THEN
 SAY "Sorry,  We will miss your input."
EXIT
</PRE>
The PARSE PULL instruction reads everything from the keyboard exactly as
it is typed, in uppercase or lowercase.  In this procedure, the name is
displayed just as you type it.  However,<I> answer</I> is changed to uppercase
characters because the PULL instruction was used.  This ensures that if
<I>yes,</I><I> Yes,</I> or<I> YES</I> is typed, the same action is taken.

<P>
EXIT Instruction
<P>
The EXIT instruction tells the procedure to end.  The EXIT instruction should
be used in a procedure that contains subroutines.  Although the EXIT instruction
is optional in some procedures, it is good programming practice to use it
at the end of every procedure.
