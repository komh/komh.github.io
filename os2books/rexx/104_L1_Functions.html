<P>
You can include function calls to internal and external routines in an expression
anywhere that a data term (such as a string) would be valid, using the notation:

<P>

<PRE>
<PRE> ÄÄfunctionÄname(ÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄ)ÄÄÄÄ

                    ³ ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ,ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿ ³
                    ³               ³ ³
                    ÀÄÁÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÁÄÙ
                       ÀÄexpressionÄÙ
</PRE>
</PRE>

<P>
<I>function-name</I> is a literal string or a single symbol, that is taken
to be a constant.
<P>
There can be up to a maximum of 20 expressions, separated by commas, between
the parentheses. These expressions are called the<I> arguments</I> to the
function. Each argument expression may include further function calls.
<P>
The ( must be adjacent to the name of the function, with no blank in between,
or the construct is not recognized as a function call. (A<I> blank operator
</I>is assumed at this point instead.)
<P>
The arguments are evaluated in turn from left to right and they are all
then passed to the function. This then executes some operation (usually
dependent on the argument strings passed, though arguments are not mandatory)
and eventually returns a single character string. This string is then included
in the original expression as though the entire function reference had been
replaced by the name of a variable that contained that data.
<P>
For example, the function SUBSTR is built-in to the language processor and
could be used as:
<PRE>N1='abcdefghijk'
Z1='Part of N1 is: 'Substr(N1,2,7)
/* would set Z1 to 'Part of N1 is: bcdefgh' */
</PRE>

<P>
A function call without any arguments must always include the parentheses
to be recognized as a function call.
<PRE>date()  /* returns the date in the default format dd mon yyyy */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Calls to Functions and Subroutines</B>
<P>
The mechanism for calling functions and subroutines is the same. The only
difference is that functions must return data, whereas subroutines need
not. The following types of routines can be called as functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Internal</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> If the routine name exists as a
label in the program, the current processing status is saved, so that it
will later be possible to return to the point of invocation to resume processing.
Control is then passed to the first label in the program that matches the
name. As with a routine invoked by the CALL instruction, various other pieces
of status information (TRACE and NUMERIC settings and so on) are also saved.
See the CALL instruction<A HREF="083_L2_CALL.html">Reference</A> for details
of this. If an internal routine is to be called as a function, you must
specify an<I> expression</I> in any RETURN instruction to return from the
function.  This is not necessary if the function is called only as a subroutine.

<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* Recursive internal function execution... */
arg x
say x'! =' factorial(x)
exit

factorial :   procedure     / *   calculate   factorial   by . .    * /
   arg   n                   / *    . .   recursive   invocation .   * /
   if   n = 0   then   return   1
   return    factorial ( n - 1 )   *   n
</PRE>

<P>
FACTORIAL is unusual in that it invokes itself (this is known as<I> recursive
invocation</I>).  The PROCEDURE instruction ensures that a new variable
<I>n</I> is created for each invocation).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B><!-- entering slot 110 --> Built-in
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>These functions are always available and are
defined later in this section.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> External</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> You
can write or make use of functions that are external to a program and to
the language processor. An external function can be written in any language,
including REXX, that supports the system-dependent interfaces used by the
language processor to invoke it. Again, when called as a function, it must
return data to the caller.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Notes:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Calling an external REXX program as a function
is similar to calling an internal routine.  The external routine is, however,
an implicit PROCEDURE in that all the caller variables are always hidden
and the status of internal values (NUMERIC settings and so on) start with
their defaults (rather than inheriting those of the caller).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Other REXX programs can be called as functions.
You can use either EXIT or RETURN to leave the invoked REXX program; in
either case, you must specify an expression.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Search Order</B>
<P>
The search order for functions is the same as in the preceding list. That
is, internal labels take first precedence, then built-in functions, and
finally external functions.
<P>
<I>Internal labels</I> are<I> not</I> used if the function name is given
as a string (that is, is specified in quotation marks); in this case the
function must be built-in or external. This lets you usurp the name of,
for example, a built-in function to extend its capabilities, but still be
able to invoke the built-in function when needed.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>/* Modified DATE to return sorted date by default */date: procedure
      arg in
      if in='' then in='Sorted'
      return 'DATE'(in)
</PRE>

<P>
<I>Built-in functions</I> have names in uppercase letters.  The name in
the literal string must be in uppercase for the search to succeed, as in
the example.  The same is usually true of external functions.
<P>
<I>External functions</I> and<I> subroutines</I> have a system-defined search
order.
<P>
REXX searches for external functions in the following order:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Functions that have been loaded into the macrospace
for pre-order execution<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Functions that are part of a function package.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REXX functions in the current directory, with
the current extension<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REXX functions along environment PATH, with the
current extension<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REXX functions in the current directory, with
the default extension<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REXX functions along environment PATH, with the
default extension<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Functions that have been loaded into the macrospace
for post-order execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Errors during Execution</B>
<P>
If an external or built-in function detects an error of any kind, the language
processor is informed, and a syntax error results.  Processing of the clause
that included the function call is therefore terminated. Similarly, if an
external function fails to return data correctly, this is detected by the
language processor and reported as an error.
<P>
If a syntax error occurs during the processing of an internal function,
it can be trapped (using SIGNAL ON SYNTAX) and recovery may then be possible.
If the error is not trapped, the program is terminated.
<P>
<B>Return Values</B>
<P>
A function normally returns a value that is substituted for the function
call when the expression is evaluated.
<P>
How the value returned by a function (or any REXX routine) is handled depends
on whether it is called by a function call or called as a subroutine with
the CALL instruction.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>A routine called as a subroutine:</B> If the routine returns a value,
that value is stored in the special variable named<I> RESULT</I>. Otherwise,
the<I> RESULT</I> variable is dropped, and its value is the string "RESULT".
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B>A routine called as a function:</B> If the function returns a value,
that value is substituted into the expression at the position where the
function was called.  Otherwise, REXX stops with an error message.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>
<PRE>/* <!-- entering slot 111 -->Different ways to call a REXX procedure */
call Beep 500, 100         /* Example 1: a subroutine call */
bc = Beep(500, 100)        /* Example 2: a function call   */
Beep(500, 100)             /* Example 3: result passed as  */
                           /*            a command         */

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>In Example 1, the built-in function BEEP is called
as a REXX subroutine. The return value from BEEP is placed in the REXX special
variable<I> RESULT</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Example
2 shows BEEP called as a REXX function. The return value from the function
is substituted for the function call. The clause itself is an assignment
instruction; the return value from the BEEP function is placed in the variable
<I>bc</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>In Example 3,
the BEEP function is processed and its return value is substituted in the
expression for the function call, just as in Example 2. In this case, however,
the clause as a whole evaluates to a single expression; therefore the evaluated
expression is passed to the current default environment as a command.
<P>
<B>ÁÖ: </B> Many other languages (such as C) throw away the return value
of a function if it is not assigned to a variable. In REXX, however, a value
returned as in Example 3 is passed on to the current environment or subcommand
handler. If that environment is CMD (the default), then this action will
result in the operating system performing a disk search for what seems to
be a command.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Built-in Functions</B>
<P>
REXX provides a rich set of built-in functions. These include character
manipulation, conversion, and information functions.
<P>
Here are some general notes on the built-in functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The parentheses in a function are always needed,
even if no arguments are required. The first parenthesis must follow the
name of the function with no space in between.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
built-in functions work internally with NUMERIC DIGITS 9 and NUMERIC FUZZ
0 and are unaffected by changes to the NUMERIC settings, except where stated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>You can supply a null string
where a<I> string</I> is referenced.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
an argument specifies a length, it must be a nonnegative whole number. If
it specifies a start character or word in a string, it must be a positive
whole number, unless otherwise stated.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Where
the last argument is optional, you can always include a comma to indicate
that you have omitted it; for example, DATATYPE(1,), like DATATYPE(1), would
return NUM.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If you specify
a<I> pad</I> character, it must be exactly one character long.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
a function has a suboption you can select by specifying the first character
of a string, that character can be in uppercase or lowercase letters.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Conversion
between characters and hexadecimal involves the machine representation of
character strings, and hence returns appropriately different results for
ASCII and EBCDIC machines.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A
number of the functions described in this chapter support the double-byte-character-set
(DBCS).  A complete list and description of these functions is given in
the<I> OS/2 Procedures Language 2/REXX Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
