<P>
SETLOCAL saves the current working drive and directory, and the current
values of the OS/2 environment variables that are local to the current process.

<P>
For example, SETLOCAL can be used to save the current environment before
changing selected settings with the VALUE function. To restore the drive,
directory, and environment, use the ENDLOCAL function.
<P>
SETLOCAL returns a value of 1 if the initial drive, directory, and environment
are successfully saved, and a value of 0 if unsuccessful. If SETLOCAL is
not followed by an ENDLOCAL function in a procedure, then the initial environment
saved by SETLOCAL will be restored upon exiting the procedure.
<P>
Here is an example:
<PRE>/* current path is 'C:\PROJ\FILES' */
n = SETLOCAL()        /* saves all environment settings    */

/* Now use the VALUE function to change the PATH variable. */
p = VALUE('Path','C:\PROC\PROGRAMS'.'OS2ENVIRONMENT')

/* Programs in directory C:\PROC\PROGRAMS may now be run   */

n = ENDLOCAL()  /* restores initial environment (including */
                /* the changed PATH variable, which is   */
                /* once again 'C:\PROJ\FILES'              */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>주: </B> Unlike their counterparts in the OS/2 Batch language (the Setlocal
and Endlocal statements), the REXX SETLOCAL and ENDLOCAL functions can be
nested.
