<H1>Getting Started in REXX</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
A REXX procedure is a program that consists of a series of tasks in one
common processing file or batch file.
<P>
Many languages can be used to write programs. BASIC, which is widely used
in home computing, has very few rules, but it requires writing many lines
of code for an intricate program.  Languages such as PL/1, COBOL, C, APL,
and PASCAL have more rules, but allow you to write more functions in fewer
lines.
<P>
REXX combines the simplicity of a programming language such as BASIC with
features that exist in more powerful languages such as writing fewer lines.
 It is easier to learn, because it uses familiar words and concepts.  REXX
allows you to do simple tasks, yet has the ability to handle complex tasks.

<P>
To get started in REXX, you need:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A Personal Computer with OS/2 Version 2.0 (or a
later version of OS/2) installed.  REXX works only in OS/2 sessions.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Knowledge about using a text editor.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Many of us learn by looking at examples, so examples of REXX procedures
are provided in this presentation. First look at the procedure, then study
the explanation of the examples to see what the procedure contains.  If
you like, try the procedure to see how it works.
