<H1>Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 27 -->
<P>
In REXX, a<I> function</I> call can be written anywhere in an expression.
 The function performs the requested computation and returns a result.  REXX
then uses the result in the expression in place of the function call.
<P>
Think of a function as:  You are trying to find someone's telephone number.
 You call the telephone operator and ask for the number.  After receiving
the number, you call the person.  The steps you have completed in locating
and calling the person could be labeled a function.
<P>
Generally, if the interpreter finds this in an expression,
<PRE>name(expression)
</PRE>

<P>
it assumes that<I> name</I> is the name of a function being called.  There
is no space between the end of the name and the left parenthesis.  If you
leave out the right parenthesis, it is an error.
<P>
The expressions inside the parentheses are the<I> arguments</I>. An argument
can itself be an expression; the interpreter computes the value of this
argument before passing it to the function.  If a function requires more
than one argument, use commas to separate each argument.
<P>
<B>Built-in Functions</B> - Rexx has more than 50 built-in functions.  A
dictionary of built-in functions is in the<I> Procedures Language 2/REXX
Reference</I>.
<P>
MAX is a built-in function that you can use to obtain the greatest number
of a set of numbers:
<PRE>MAX(number, number, ...)
</PRE>

<P>
For example:
<PRE>   MAX(2,4,8,6) = 8
   MAX(2,4+5,6) = 9
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in the second example, the 4+5 is an expression. A function call,
like any other expression, usually is contained in a clause as part of an
assignment or instruction.
