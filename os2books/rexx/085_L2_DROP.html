<P>
Each<I> name</I> is a valid variable symbol, optionally enclosed in parentheses
(to denote a subsidiary list), and separated from any other<I> name</I> by
one or more blanks or comments.
<P>
DROP is used to<I> unassign</I> variables; that is, to restore them to their
original uninitialized state.
<P>
Each variable specified is dropped from the list of known variables. If
a single<I> name</I> is enclosed in parentheses, then its value is used
as a subsidiary list of variables to drop. This stored list must follow
the same rules as for the main list (that is, valid variable names, separated
by blanks) but with no parentheses and no leading or trailing blanks. The
variables are dropped in sequence from left to right. It is not an error
to specify a name more than once, or to DROP a variable that is not known.
If an exposed variable is named (see the PROCEDURE instruction), the variable
itself in the older generation is dropped.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>j=4
Drop  a x.3 x.j
/* would reset the variables: A, X.3, and X.4 */
/* so that reference to them returns their name.    */
</PRE>

<P>
Here, a variable name in parentheses is used as a subsidiary list.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>x=4;y=5;z=6;
a='x y z'
DROP (a)    /* will drop x,y, and z */
</PRE>

<P>
If a<I> stem</I> is specified (that is, a symbol that contains only one
period, as the last character), all variables starting with that stem are
dropped.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>Drop  x.
/* would reset all variables with names starting with X. */
</PRE>
