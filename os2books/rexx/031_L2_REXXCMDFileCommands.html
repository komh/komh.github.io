<P>
In a REXX procedure, anything not recognized as an instruction, assignment,
or label is considered a command.  The statement recognized as a command
is treated as an expression.  The expression is evaluated first, then the
result is passed to the operating system.
<P>
The following example, COPYLIST.CMD, shows how a command is treated as an
expression.  Note how the special character (*) is put in quotation marks.
COPYLIST.CMD copies files from drive A to drive B.
<PRE>/* Issuing a command from a procedure.  This example copies  */
/* all files that have an extension of.LST from              */
/* drive A to drive B.                                       */
SAY
COPY "a:*.lst b:"           /* This statement is treated as  */
                            /* an expression.                */
                            /* The result is passed to OS/2. */
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
<B>аж: </B> In the preceding example, the whole OS/2 command except for
<I>COPY</I> is in quotation marks for the following reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If the colon (:) were not in quotation marks, the
REXXSAA interpreter would treat<I> a:</I> and<I> b:</I> as labels.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If the asterisk (*) were not in quotation marks,
the REXXSAA interpreter would attempt to multiply the value of<I> a:</I> by
<I>.LST</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>It is also acceptable to include the entire
OS/2 command in quotation marks so that<I> "COPY a:*.LST b:"</I> is displayed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
