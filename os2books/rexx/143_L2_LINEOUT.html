<P>
LINEOUT returns the count of lines remaining after attempting to write<I> string
</I>to the character output stream<I> name</I>. The count is either 0 (meaning
the line was successfully written) or 1 (meaning that an error occurred
while writing the line).<I> string</I> can be the null string, in which
case only the action associated with completing a line is taken. LINEOUT
adds a line-feed and a carriage-return character to the end of<I> string</I>.

<P>
The form of the<I> name</I> is implementation dependent. If<I> name</I> is
omitted, the line is written to the default output stream, STDOUT: (normally
the display) in OS/2.
<P>
For persistent streams, a write position is maintained for each stream.
In the OS/2 operating system, this is the same as the read position. Any
write to the stream starts at the current write position by default. Characters
written by a call to LINEOUT can be added to a partial line. LINEOUT conceptually
terminates a line at the<I> end</I> of each call. When the write is completed,
the write position is set to the beginning of the line following the one
just written. The initial write position is the end of the stream, so that
calls to LINEOUT normally append lines to the end of the stream.
<P>
You can set the write position to the first character of a persistent stream
by giving a value of 1 (the only valid value) for<I> line</I>.
<P>
<B>ÁÖ: </B> In some environments, overwriting a stream using CHAROUT or
LINEOUT can erase (destroy) all existing data in the stream. This is not,
however, the case in the OS/2 environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
You can omit the<I> string</I> for persistent streams. If you specify<I> line</I>,
the write position is set to the beginning of the stream, but nothing is
written to the stream, and 0 is returned.  If you specify neither<I> line
</I>nor<I> string</I>, the write position is set to the end of the stream.
This use of LINEOUT has the effect of closing the stream in environments
(such as the OS/2 environment) that support this concept.
<P>
Execution of the program normally stops until the output operation is effectively
completed. If, however, it is impossible for a line to be written, the NOTREADY
condition is raised and LINEOUT returns with a result of 1 (that is, the
residual count of lines written).
<P>
Here are some examples:
<PRE>LINEOUT(,'Display this')    /* Writes string to the default   */
                            /* output stream (normally, the   */
                            /* display); returns 0 if         */
                            /* successful                     */

myfile = 'ANYFILE.TXT'
LINEOUT(myfile,'A new line')  /* Opens the file ANYFILE.TXT and */
                              /* appends the string to the end. */
                              /* If the file is already open,   */
                              /* the string is written at the   */
                              /* current write position.        */
                              /* Returns 0 if successful.       */

LINEOUT(myfile,'A new start',1)/* Opens the file (if not already */
                               /* open); overwrites first line   */
                               /* with a new line.               */
                               /* Returns 0 if successful.       */

LINEOUT(myfile,,1)            /* Opens the file (if not already */
                              /* open). No write; sets write    */
                              /* position at first character.   */

LINEOUT(myfile)               /* Closes ANYFILE.TXT             */
</PRE>

<P>
LINEOUT is often most useful when called as a subroutine. The return value
is then available in the variable RESULT. For example:
<PRE>Call LINEOUT 'A:rexx.bat','Shell',1
Call LINEOUT ,'Hello'

<P>
<B>ÁÖ: </B> If the lines are to be written to the default output stream
without the possibility of error, use the SAY instruction instead.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
