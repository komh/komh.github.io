<H1>OS/2 Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
A<I> command</I> is a word, phrase, or abbreviation that tells the system
to do something.  In REXX, anything that is not a REXX instruction, assignment,
or label is considered a command.  For example, you can use OS/2 commands
such as COPY, BACKUP, PRINT, TYPE, and so on in your procedures.
<P>
Here is an example of using the OS/2 command, TYPE, in a REXX procedure:

<PRE>/* Issuing commands in REXX */
TYPE hello.cmd
EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
This means that REXX will cause TYPE to be run.
