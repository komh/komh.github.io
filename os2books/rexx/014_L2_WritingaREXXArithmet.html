<H1>Writing a REXX Arithmetic Procedure</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
The following is an exercise that will serve as a review of some of the
rules used in the previous examples.  You are to write a procedure that
adds two numbers.  Name the procedure ADD.CMD.
<P>
Here is a list of what you need to do in this procedure:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Identify and describe the REXX procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tell the user to type numbers.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Read the numbers typed and put them into system
memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Add two numbers and display the answer on the
screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tell the interpreter to leave the procedure.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are many ways to write procedures to accomplish the same task.  To
make it easier in this procedure, the user is asked for each number separately,
then the numbers are added.  The following is the thought process you might
use to write the procedure for ADD.CMD.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, what identifies a REXX procedure?  If
you thought of a comment, you were right.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Next,
you need to tell the user to enter a number.  The SAY instruction prints
a message on your screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If the number is entered, it needs to be
put into computer memory.  The PULL instruction collects a response and
puts it in memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An instruction requesting a second number
can look just like the first instruction; the second number also needs to
be put in memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 5.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The next instruction is similar to one in
the MATH procedure.  In one statement, it can tell the interpreter to add
the two values in memory and display the sum on your screen.  This can be
one instruction.  The instruction contains a string and the addition operation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 6.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Finally, the EXIT instruction is used to
end the procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 7.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If you want to test this program, type the
procedure listed here and file it.
<PRE>/* This procedure adds two numbers */SAY "Enter the first number."
PULL num1
SAY "Enter the second number."
PULL num2
SAY "The sum of the two numbers is" num1 + num2
EXIT
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To test ADD.CMD, type<I> ADD</I> at the OS/2 command prompt and try some
numbers. Here is what the procedure should look like when it is run, and
your numbers are 3 and 12.
<PRE>[C:\]ADDEnter the first number.

3

Enter the second number.

12

The sum of the two numbers is 15

[C:\]
