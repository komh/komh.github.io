<H1>What do all those keywords mean when making a DLL?</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
Okay, with the help of some of my peers, I've solved the mystery surrounding
the seemingly redundant SINGLE/MULTIPLE and SHARED/NONSHARED attributes.

<P>
First, some prep up work...
<P>
Every DLL needs and gets a data segment ("automatic data segment"). It is
the place where the DLL stores all its STATIC data--basically the data declared
in the DLL module but declared outside any function AND (I venture) variables
declared STATIC within a DLL function as well. The STACK is NOT!! part of
a DLL's automatic data segment (thoug it seems to be for an EXE). The stack
that is used when 'running' a DLL function is that of the calling thread.

<P>
Now here's the clincher...
<P>
DLLs CAN ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL DATA SEGMENTS!! (as can EXEs, I imagine)
<P>
Bingo! Now we understand why there are two different sets of attributes--specifically,
NONE/SINGLE/MULTIPLE and SHARED/NONSHARED. Though they basically do the
same thing, they APPLY to different things.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
NONE/SINGLE/MULTIPLE<!-- lm: 0x11 10 -->
<UL> applies to the one and only
default data segment. This is the data segment that is "automatically" created
for your DLL (or EXE). I imagine that for 90% of the DLLs written, this
is the only type of data segment that exists. Whether or not this data segment
is shared or whether a private copy is created for each linking application
is A DIRECT FUNCTION OF THIS ATTRIBUTE--'SINGLE'=it's shared, 'MULTIPLE'=everyone
get's his own copy.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> SHARED/NONSHARED<!-- lm: 0x11 10 -->
<UL> This
SETS THE DEFAULT!! FOR ALL DATA SEGMENTS other than the "automatic" data
segment. DEFAULT is the key word, because you can specify, through the SEGMENTS
statement, the characteristics of these additional segments on an individual
basis (which in all certainty, override this value.)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
So...to answer my own question &gt;could {someone} explain what the following
statements would &gt;produce:
<BR>
&gt;
<BR>
&gt;        DATA MULTIPLE SHARED
<BR>

<P>
Every application which links to the DLL will have it's own private copy
of the automatic data segment. If the DLL has no additional data segments,
the SHARED keyword is meaningless and can be omitted. If there are additional
data segments, only one copy of each will exist and they will be shared
by all applications (unless a SEGMENTS statement follows which overrides
this default for a specific segment) &gt;        or
<BR>
&gt;        DATA SINGLE NONSHARED
<BR>

<P>
Every application which links to the DLL will share a single automatic data
segment (hence, each app that affects the DLL STATIC data will affect it
for all apps). If there are no additional data segments, the NONSHARED keyword
is meaningless and can be omitted. If there are, a private copy will be
created for each app (unless overriden by a SEGMENTS statement).
<P>
Note that in the absence of BOTH a SINGLE/MUTLIPLE and SHARED/NONSHARED
keyword, the default is for ALL data segments (automatic and additional
ones) to be shared (i.e., only one copy). In the absence of one OR the other,
but not both, the property of ALL data segments are mandated by the single
keyword. In other words, DATA SINGLE
<BR>
 and
<BR>
DATA SHARED
<BR>

<P>
do the same exact thing.
