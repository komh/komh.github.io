<H1>Explain the SYS_DLLS keywords.</H1><!-- entering slot 111 -->
<P>
Actually there are three key names that exist for the app name SYS_DLLS.

<P>
They are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
Load<!-- lm: 0x11 10 -->
<UL> DLL loaded and ordinal 1 entry point called
for every msg queue created in the system<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> LoadPerProcess
<!-- lm: 0x11 10 -->
<UL>DLL loaded and ordinal 1 entry point called for
only the first message queue created on a process<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> LoadOneTime
<!-- lm: 0x11 10 -->
<UL>DLL loaded and ordinal 1 entry point called for
only the shell's message queue (the first PM queue in the system)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
You would use one over another depending on the type of initialization that
you require.  Most DLL's only need to be initialized once for the system
and are thus LoadOneTime, some DLLs like PMCTLS have per process initialization
and thus are LoadPerProcess, and then there is the very rare case of DLLs
that need to perform some function every time a message queue is created
and these are specified as Load.  Note: that anything other than LoadOneTime
is a significant performance hit on the system.  Note: also that in addition
to your INITIALIZATION/TERMINATION function specified in the DEF file for
your DLL (which is a new feature in 2.0), your ORDINAL 1 entry point in
your DLL is also called.  Be careful with this as I have seen some pretty
strange results if you have an ordinal 1 entry point that has nothing to
do with initialization.  In addition, remember to never ever create a message
queue inside of your initialization routine.  Always call WinQueryAnchorBlock
if you need a HAB for some API.
<P>
As for shared resources, if you need resources on multiple processes then
they need to be created on multiple processes as they won't be valid on
any process other than the one you loaded.  I believe that this is the reason
PMCTLS is LoadPerProcess.  You have a few options here, 1) you can store
your resources in shared memory, and 2) for icons you can call WinSetPoinerOwner
to make your icons shared across the entire system.
