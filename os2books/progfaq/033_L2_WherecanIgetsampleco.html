<H1>Where can I get sample code?</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
There is a lot of sample code included in the IBM Toolkit, and four sample
programs (with source) included with C-Set++.  GNU C/C++, from cdrom.com,
includes a sample C, C++, and C++ PM program.  The OS/2 Redbooks also have
some sample code.  cdrom.com also has little bits of OS/2 and PM source
code lying around in the os2/2_x/program directory.
