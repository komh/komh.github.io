<P>
IBM has created the MMPM/2 toolkit just for that.  However, if that is too
much trouble for you, there is a simple REXX interface to MMPM/2 available
in OS/2 2.1.
<P>
IBM's Ultimedia Builder/2, Ultimedia Perfect Image/2, and Ultimedia Workplace/2
are all in beta and scheduled to be released soon.
<P>
For the Emx/GCC enviroment there is the mm4emx package by Marc Van Woerkom.
mm4emx is freeware. All header and lib files included.
