<H1>How do I write an OS/2 device driver?</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
The preferred method is to buy the OS/2 device driver kit (DDK) from IBM.
 It contains samples for display, printer, SCSI, and other drivers. You
can develop kernel and PM drivers.	NOTE:  The kernel debugger comes with
the IBM Toolkit, sold separately.
<P>
There's a book called Writing OS/2 2.0 Device Drivers in C from Van Nostrand-Reinhold
and also IBM's flood of printed material.
<P>
As reference to SCSI programming, check SCSI Programming FAQ, available
at ftp.regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de
