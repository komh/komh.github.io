<H1>How does programming PM compare to programming X?</H1><!-- entering slot 104 -->
<P>
Many people have said "PM is much cleaner."  Until I hear from someone I
trust with extensive experience with both (I only know X), however, this
FAQ will take no position.
<P>
There was an unsubstantiated rumor that someone was porting an X library
to OS/2 (X-Windows, not X-Mode or any other X), I dunno whether this has
been substantiated or not.
<P>
IBM and a few other manufacturers have built their own X servers for OS/2.

I have some limited experience with X and PM.  Raw Xlib is harder to program
than PM.  However most, if not all, of the X11 Toolkits are *easier* to
use than PM.  I have experience comparing XView to PM. A friend of mine
has experience with Windows versus Xt, and has the same opinion (Windows
isn't that far off conceptually from PM).
