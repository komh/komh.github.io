<H1>What is REXX?  How do I write and run a REXX program?</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
REXX is the IBM SAA (Systems Application Architecture) standard, user-friendly
programming language.  It is available for IBM mainframes, Unix, the Amiga,
DOS (Quercus's Personal REXX), Windows, and other platforms.  It has been
a part of standard OS/2 since Version 1.3.  Programs written in REXX that
do not use system-specific libraries are fully portable.
<P>
OS/2 2.x comes with an online REXX reference, and printed REXX documentation
is available (Mike Cowlishaw's REXX book, IBM's twin guides).  The Usenet
group comp.lang.rexx discusses REXX programming.
<P>
It should be stressed, however, that OS/2's online REXX reference is a reference,
not really a tutor.	Paul Prescod (papresco@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca)
is working on a free REXX tutor, which will be available on cdrom.com.
<P>
Watcom also makes VX REXX and Hockware makes VisPro/REXX.  Both of these
products allow quick and easy development of REXX PM programs.
