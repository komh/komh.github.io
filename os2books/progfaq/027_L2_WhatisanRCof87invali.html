<P>
You are (most likely) not including the prototype.  Use the following flags
to get a good balance of warning messages:
<P>
    /Kbperc
<P>
For C Set++, I use these flags as the approximate equivalent
<P>
    /Wall /Wext- /Wgnr- /Wgot- /Wpor- /Wppt- /Wtrd /Wuni- /Wvft-
<P>
I have these set as part of my ICC string in CONFIG.SYS, so I don't have
to add them to each compile.  I have found that these settings give me a
good combination of thorough warning messages without too many warnings.
