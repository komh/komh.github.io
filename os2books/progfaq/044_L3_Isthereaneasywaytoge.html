<H1>Is there an easy way to get printer output (another opinion)?</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->

<I>Generally:  My understanding was that OS/2 would handle printing for
me.  That is to say that I wouldn't have to create separate printer drivers
for every printer under the sun (or any for that matter).  Since I am creating
an image on the screen that is device independent (well, mostly anyway),
is there an easy way to get printer output?</I>
<P>
PM achieves a level of device independence by defining a logical output
space.  This logical output space is then bound to a physical output space,
which creates a mapping of logical characteristics to their physical counterparts.
 The logical and physical output spaces are referred to as the presentation
space and the device context (HPS and HDC) and are bound to one another
by using either the GpiAssociate function or by specifying GPIA_ASSOC to
the GpiCreatePS function.
<P>
The easiest way to accomplish what you desire is to organize your drawing
code into one or more functions with a single entrypoint that accepts an
HPS as a parameter.  Then, when you want to draw to the screen, you can
call WinGetPS/WinBeginPaint to get an HPS and call the function. When you
want hardcopy, you call DevOpenDC to get an HDC and GpiCreatePS to get an
HPS and call the function.
<P>
Note that to get hardcopy, you need to perform some additional setup to
get things to work properly.  The two most important things are that you
initialize the DEVOPENSTRUC structure properly before calling DevOpenDC
and that you send the following escape codes (via DevEscape) at the following
times:
<PRE>  hdcPrn=DevOpenDC(...);
  hpsPrn=GpiCreatePS(...);

  DevEscape(...,DEVESC_STARTDOC,...);

  if (!doDraw(hpsPrn)) {
     DevEscape(...,DEVESC_ABORTDOC,...);
  } /* endif */

  DevEscape(...,DEVESC_ENDDOC,...);

  GpiDestroyPS(hpsPrn);
  DevCloseDC(hdcPrn);
</PRE>

<P>
I'm not sure because I can't seem to find my copy anywhere, but I belive
that the book by Graham Winn (entitled something to the effect of "Building
applications using the OS/2 Presentation Manager") dedicates a chapter to
the nuances of printing.
