<I>But to my question:  How do I build my own "smart icons", i.e. bitmaps
on pushbuttons, that optically "move into the screen"? I didn't find any
way to achieve this with the Toolkit's Dialog Editor.  But as mentioned
above, I know there's a way.</I>
<P>
Starting with OS/2 2.x, a new button style was added - BS_ICON - which allows
you to do what you are trying to accomplish.  It works, as far as I know,
only for pushbuttons, and the icon or bitmap is taken from the resource
file, whose resource id is specified in the pushbutton text.
<P>
For example:
<P>
In FOO.H:
<PRE>#define IDBM_BUTTON 256
#define IDPB_BUTTON 257
</PRE>

<P>
In FOO.RC:
<PRE>BITMAP IDBM_BUTTON BUTTON.BMP
</PRE>

<P>
In FOO.C:
<PRE>sprintf(achText,"#%d",IDBM_BUTTON);

hwndButton=WinCreateWindow(hwndClient,WC_BUTTON,achText,
                           WS_VISIBLE|BS_PUSHBUTTON|BS_ICON,
                           10,10,32,32,hwndClient,HWND_TOP,
                           IDPB_BUTTON,NULL,NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
The bitmap is stretched or compressed to fill the button.
