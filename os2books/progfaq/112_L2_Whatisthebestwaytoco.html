<H1>What is the best way to communicate between threads?</H1><!-- entering slot 132 -->
<P>
The best way to communicate between threads is sometimes also <A HREF="111_L2_Whatisthebestwaytoco.html">the
best way to communicate between processes.</A>  However, when communicating
between threads you can utilize two (very important) techniques:
<P>
<U><I>Semaphores</I></U>
<P>
In order to share application resources, and not write to the same space
at the same time, you have to have some kind of flags that tell the thread
when it should stop, when it should keep on going, and so on. Semaphores
provide this capability.  Semaphores are<I> not</I> for passing data.  They
merely exist as simple flags between threads and you should treat them as
such.
<P>
<U><I>Global Variables</I></U>
<P>
"Hey Jeff - I thought this was supposed to be about nifty OS/2-specific
tricks!"  It is!  You can now use those old nasty things, global variables,
in new ways.  In conjunction with semaphores, you can pass data very easily
between threads with global variables.  Here's a simple example:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a global variable called PassData.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a semaphore called OkToPassData.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a semaphore called DataPassed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Have two threads work at the same time:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>If the semaphore DataPassed is true:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>
1.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore OkToPassData to false.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> 2.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>Read the data in the global.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore DataPassed to false.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore OkToPassData to true.
<!-- lm: 0x2 7 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> b.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>When
a thread wants to pass data, wait for the semaphore to be clear.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> c.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore OkToPassData to false.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> d.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Put the data in the global.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> e.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore DataPassed to true.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> f.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Set the semaphore OkToPassData to true.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Of course, there are issues of deadlock and other such nonsense that corporate
chaps get paid to consider, but that's beyond the scope of this document.
