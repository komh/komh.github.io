<I>Electronic Developers' Magazine/2</I>
<P>
Excellent electronic magazine for OS/2 developers.  Available somewhat monthly
from ftp-os2.cdrom.com in 2_x/program/newsltr/edmi*.zip.
<P>
<I>PC Magazine</I>
<P>
While this is not by any means a dedicated OS/2 programming magazine, it
includes several gems from Charles Petzold, most notably a nice series on
font handling.
