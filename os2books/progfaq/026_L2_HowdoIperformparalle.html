<H1>How do I perform parallel compilation?</H1><!-- entering slot 30 -->
<P>
You can accomplish parallel compilation in one of two ways. The first involves
GNU Make, the second involves DMAKE.
<P>
GNU Make:
<P>
To perform parallel compilation with GNU Make simply do two things:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Make sure your make file does not execute the make
utility (again) from inside the make file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>On the GNU Make command line, specify '--jobs
x', where 'x' is the maximum number of concurrent jobs you will allow GNU
Make to execute. If you do not wish to have a maximum, then you may specify
simply '--jobs' and GNU Make will execute as many jobs as possible at one
time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
DMAKE:
<P>
The ini file comes in the dmake archive in a few different flavours.  Take
the file with the extension .msc and rename it to dmake.ini.  Set an environment
variable in config.sys
<P>
SET MAKESTARTUP=d:\COMPILER\DMAKE.INI

====== Makefile
<PRE>CC=iccCOPTS=/Sm /Gt+ /Ti+ /O- /Gs+
CONLY=-c

LIBS=os2

INCS=psfax2.h

MAXPROCESS=2

all: psfax2.exe sendfax.exe

modem.obj:  modem.c $(INCS)
   $(CC) $(CONLY) $(COPTS) modem.c

psfax2.obj: psfax2.c $(INCS)
   $(CC) $(CONLY) $(COPTS) psfax2.c

psfax2.exe: psfax2.obj modem.obj
   link386 /ST:32768 /CO psfax2+modem;

sendfax.obj: sendfax.c $(INCS)
   $(CC) $(CONLY) $(COPTS) sendfax.c

sendfax.exe: sendfax.obj modem.obj
   link386 /ST:32768 /CO sendfax+modem;
</PRE>

<P>
====== End of makefile
<P>
Couple of gotchas.  There is a bug in the MAXPROCESS handling of the copy
I use.  Set it to 1, and you get a typical make, ie one at a time. Set it
to 2, and the thing launches 3 processes. Ie with more than 1, you actually
get n+1 processes running.
<P>
Another caveat
<PRE>xxx.yy: aaa.bbb
    command1
    command2
    command3
</PRE>

<P>
The above structure does not work.  The reason is that all 3 commands will
be spawned together in parallel sessions.  To serialize them you must make
up dependancies in the makefile.  I ran into this becuase I have one makefile
that completes every link stage by copying the result onto a network drive.
 I had to take all the links that previously had 2 commands, and break them
into 2 blocks with the second being a dependancy of the remote file on the
local file, and the copy command.
<P>
One more word of warning, dmake is not to pleased with those convoluted
things that workframe spits out in the name of makefiles.  You may have
to do a significant amount of makefile editing, depending on how you makefile
look now.
<P>
Provided that 3 simultaneous copies of your compiler doesn't push your machine
into excessive swapping, the improvements in build speed are amazing.  Before
dmake I'd never seen a build actually top the cpu meter here, the process
was<!-- entering slot 31 --> always waiting for disk as it loaded compilers/headers
etc.	Now the compiler sits in ram and just gets re-used, and the headers
are coming directly from cache all the time. Build time cut in half, and
my cpu guage is pegged at 100% when a build is running.
