<H1>How can I view the GNU C documentation?</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
GNU C/C++ comes with documentation from the Free Software Foundation in
texinfo (.texi) format.  This documentation is about gcc in general, and
has no OS/2-specific information.
<P>
All utilities needed to compile/view/tex the texinfo files are readily available
for OS/2.  The GNU texinfo package, available on cdrom.com in os2/all/unix/gnu/gnuinfo.zip,
includes makeinfo.exe for compiling texinfo, info.exe for viewing them,
and texinfo.tex and texindex.exe for TeXing them.
<P>
An ASCII text version of the gcc documentation is also available on cdrom.com,
in the file os2/2_x/unix/gnu/gcc2_233/gcc_inf.zip.
<P>
An INF hypertext version of the gcc (and related programs) documentation
was uploaded recently to cdrom.com.
<P>
emx/gcc includes its own hypertext style reader and texinfo files for all
the GNU tools that come with it.
<P>
GCC/2 includes the hypertext manuals for gcc, gas, and gnumake as well as
a PM reader for the manuals.
<P>
GNU Emacs for OS/2 reads GNU info files in their native format, with no
conversion necessary on the user's part.
