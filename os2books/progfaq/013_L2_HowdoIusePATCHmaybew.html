The file format is actually quite simple - you just need a text file which
consists of lines each starting with one of the following commands:
<P>
  FILE &lt;filename&gt;     e.g. FILE test.exe
<P>
specifies the file to which the following instructions are to be applied.
A patch file may contain multiple FILE directives.
<P>
  VER &lt;offset&gt; &lt;data&gt;   e.g. VER 00001234 abcdef
<P>
checks if the specified data is present at the given file offset [all values
in hex, data can be just a string of digits with no blanks in between; up
to 16 bytes are allowed in one statement]. If the check fails, the patch
process is aborted resp. the program skips to the next FILE statement.
<P>
  CHA &lt;offset&gt; &lt;data&gt;   e.g. CHA 00001234 012345
<P>
changes the data at the given offset - syntax is same as in VER. It is a
good idea to do all VERification before starting the first CHA.
<P>
Blank lines and data lines starting with a ";" are ignored.
<P>
As you can see from this, there seems to be no way to _insert_ or _delete_
bytes in the file. To make patches applicable to multiple versions of the
same file, you can specifiy more than one FILE directive for the same filename
- only a patch with all VER commands matching is executed.
