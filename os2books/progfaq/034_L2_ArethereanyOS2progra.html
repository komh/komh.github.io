<H1>Are there any OS/2 programming classes or seminars?</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
Yes.  Call IBM at either 1-800-3-IBM-OS2 in U.S. (or the PS/2 Help Center).
 Local IBM branches frequently hold OS/2 classes and seminars.
<P>
See os2/2_x/info/ivleague.txt on cdrom.com or the User's Edition for a list
of third-party support organizations.
<P>
Make sure to check your local software companies.  Many of them offer OS/2
specific classes also.
