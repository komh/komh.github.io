 In Win3.x (but apparently NOT Win32), there's a hPrevInst handle; is there
an OS/2 2.x equivalent?  Basically, I'm thinking in terms of a program that
would try to borrow resources from a previous instance if a previous instance
is running.  (Specifically, if my palette animation program gets started
twice, the second instance oughta share palettes with the first instance!)

What you're really asking is two questions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->How can I determine if a previous instance of
my application is already running?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->How can I share resources between multiple instances
of my application?<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
There are some ways to achieve this; You can use semaphores or/and shared
memory or the other method described below. Try to open your named semaphore,
if it's there, your application is already running, else create a semaphore...
To share data, use shared memory. There are some excellent examples in Schildt
&amp; Goosey "OS/2 Programming".

<P>
To answer your first question, you need to enumerate all of the main windows
present on the desktop, and figure out if any of them are yours. This is
achieved using the following code:
<PRE>HWND queryAppInstance(PCHAR pchClassWanted)
{
   HENUM heEnum;
   HWND hwndTop;
   HWND hwndClient;
   CHAR achClass[256];

   heEnum=WinBeginEnumWindows(HWND_DESKTOP);

   hwndTop=WinGetNextWindow(heEnum);
   while (hwndTop!=NULLHANDLE) {
      hwndClient=WinWindowFromID(hwndTop,FID_CLIENT);
      if (hwndClient!=NULLHANDLE) {
         WinQueryClassName(hwndClient,sizeof(achClass),achClass);
         if (strcmp(achClass,pchClassWanted)==0) {
            WinEndEnumWindows(heEnum);
            return hwndClient;
         } /* endif */
      } /* endif */

      hwndTop=WinGetNextWindow(heEnum);
   } /* endwhile */

   WinEndEnumWindows(heEnum);
   return NULLHANDLE;
}
</PRE>

<P>
To answer your second question, the only way that I know of to share resources
is to place them in a DLL.  The procedure to do this is as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Create a dummy source file with an empty procedure
in it.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Compile the source file and link as a DLL.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Add your resources to the DLL in the same manner
as you would to an executable.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Then, when your application starts, you simply call WinLoadLibrary  (the
preferred way) or DosLoadModule to load the DLL.  These functions return
a handle to the DLL which must then be used in any function which loads
resources (e.g. GpiLoadBitmap, WinLoadPointer, etc.).
<P>
Note that this procedure does not require knowing the window handle of any
previous instance of your application because OS/2 implements DLLs in a
shared fashion (which I suspect is one of the reasons they were created
in the first place).  All you need to know is the<!-- entering slot 107 --> name
of the DLL.  This technique can also be used to share resources between
different applications.
