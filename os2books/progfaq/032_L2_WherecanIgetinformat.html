<H1>Where can I get information on OS/2 APIs and programming?</H1><!-- entering slot 37 -->
<P>
The IBM Programmer's Toolkit, included in Workset/2, includes a complete
on-line syscall reference.
<P>
You can FTP the documentation for the 16-bit calls (IBM does not supply
them), such as Vio*(), Kbd*(), Mou*(), from cdrom.com as os2/2_x/program/inf16bit.zip.

<P>
You can order the seventeen volume IBM OS/2 Technical Library (possibly
at a discount, see question 1.2) and/or order various volumes individually.

<P>
Most of these volumes are now published by Que books also, and can be found
in many bookstores.
<P>
All this information is also on the OS/2 Online Library Omnibus Edition:
OS/2 Collection CD-ROM (SK2T-2176), and the Professional Developer's Kit
CD-ROMs have this information as well.
