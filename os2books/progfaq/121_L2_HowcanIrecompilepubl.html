<H1>How can I recompile public domain/shareware source code for OS/2?</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
Most publicly available OS/2 programs come with binaries (since there is
currently only one OS/2 architecture).  If you are porting source code from
another system (for example, Unix), you will first need to acquire a compiler.
 See section 1 for information on compilers; in particular, note that the
GNU C compiler is available.
<P>
You should realize that many publicly available programs have already been
ported to OS/2.  Check the many FTP sites carrying OS/2 programs before
you reinvent any wheels (the OS/2 User's FAQ contains information on FTP
site).
<P>
Most Unix applications (through the use of emx/gcc) port with extreme ease;
DOS and Windows applications are a tougher problem, and require many changes
before they can be recompiled as a native OS/2 program.
<P>
(It is interesting to note that MicroSoft C v6.0 will compile bound OS/2
programs, which will run under DOS<I> and</I> OS/2 without modification.)
