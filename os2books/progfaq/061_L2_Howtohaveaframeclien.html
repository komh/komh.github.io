<PRE> FRAMECDATA fcdata;

 fcdata.cb	      = sizeof( FRAMECDATA );
 fcdata.flCreateFlags = FCF_TASKLIST | FCF_MENU, etc.;
 fcdata.hmodResources = 0; // or the hmod of the DLL containing the resources
 fcdata.idResources   = ID_RESOURCES;  // ID of the resources, as usual

 hwndFrame = WinCreateWindow( HWND_DESKTOP, WC_FRAME, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                              NULLHANDLE, HWND_TOP, ID_RESOURCES,
                              &amp;fcdata, NULL);

 hwndClient = WinCreateWindow( hwndFrame, szClientClass, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                               NULLHANDLE, HWND_TOP, FID_CLIENT, NULL, NULL );

 WinSetWindowPos( hwndFrame, HWND_TOP, x, y, cx, cy,
                  SWP_ZORDER | SWP_SIZE | SWP_MOVE |
                  SWP_SHOW | SWP_ACTIVATE );
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to then add new controls, like the system menu, you would do
this:
<PRE> fcdata.flCreateFlags = FCF_SYSMENU;
 WinCreateFrameControls( hwndFrame, &amp;fcdata, NULL );
 WinSendMsg( hwndFrame, WM_UPDATEFRAME,
             MPFROMLONG( FCF_SYSMENU ), NULL );
</PRE>

<P>
The same thing applies to all the other controls like FCF_SIZEBORDER, FCF_TITLEBAR,
FCF_HORZSCROLL, FCF_MINMAX, etc. You could also OR more than one together
if you wanted to add more than one frame control in the same shot. On the
titlebar, you need to also send this message:
<PRE> WinSendMsg( WinWindowFromID( hwndFrame, FID_TITLEBAR ),
             TBM_SETHILITE, MPFROMSHORT( TRUE ), NULL );
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to delete frame controls, you would do this (assuming system
menu):
<PRE> WinDestroyWindow( WinWindowFromID( hwndFrame, FID_SYSMENU ) );
 WinSendMsg( hwndFrame, WM_UPDATEFRAME,
             MPFROMLONG( FCF_SYSMENU ), NULL );
</PRE>

<P>
Unfortunately this doesn't fit completely well with OOP, since the controls
really are not themselves objects independent of the frame window. One of
the problems here is that in order to make them independent objects, you
need to know the internals of the frame window proc. For instance, you would
think that the MIN and MAX are two WC_BUTTON controls, but they are really
one menu with two bitmap menuitems (at least in 1.x they were). So if you
were to do a WinCreateWindow for either, you'd have to know where to get
the bitmaps, and hope that doesn't change.
<P>
Similarly you'd have to be able to construct the system menu after creating
a WC_MENU window. This isn't a tough feat, but if a later version of OS/2
adds a new menu item to the system menu, you'd have to become aware of it.

<P>
The titlebar and the scrollbars aren't a problem since they have their own
public window classes - WC_TITLEBAR and WC_SCROLLBAR respectively. You can,
for instance, do a WinCreateWindow( ..., WC_SCROLLBAR,..., FID_HORZSCROLL,
..), then send the frame a WM_UPDATEFRAME message for FCF_HORZSCROLL and
this would work. But there is no WC_SIZEBORDER so you couldn't use this
method to add the sizing border later. So for the sizing border you need
to use the method I first posted above.
<P>
I spoke too soon about the sizing border. If you want to add or remove it
from a frame window, you need to add or remove the FS_SIZEBORDER style from
the frame, then send the frame an UPDATEFRAME message for FCF_SIZEBORDER.

<P>
To change the style, here is a technique that John Webb just turned me on
to. To add the style:
<PRE> WinSetWindowBits( hwndFrame, QWL_STYLE, FS_SIZEBORDER, FS_SIZEBORDER );
</PRE>

<P>
To remove it:
<PRE> WinSetWindowBits( hwndFrame QWL_STYLE, 0, FS_SIZEBORDER );
</PRE>

<P>
Also, if you want to add or remove just one of the MIN or the MAX, you basically
need to get the window handle of the MINMAX menu, then do a MM_<!-- entering slot 73 -->REMOVEITEMfortheoneyouwanttoremove
