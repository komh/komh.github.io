<P>
For historical reasons, most Unix C libraries' stdio default to using line
buffered streams, whereas most DOS and OS/2 C libraries' stdio default to
using fully buffered streams.  ANSI C species that standard output should
be line buffered when connected to an interactive device, but not all libraries
are ANSI compliant.  You can control the buffering algorithm used for a
particular stream with the setvbuf() function.

If you didn't understand that paragraph, read on.

printf() is part of the Standard I/O (stdio) library, which uses buffered
streams for file IO.  ANSI C specifies three algorithms for deciding when
to flush the buffer (i.e. when to print buffered data to the file):<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>not buffered.  Data is flushed to the file as soon
as possible, usually immediately after being received.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>line buffered.  Data is flushed to the file
when a newline is received (and the newline is also flushed).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>fully buffered.  Data is flushed to the file
when the buffer is full.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Buffered data is always flushed when the stream is closed or when fflush()
is called.  Since standard output is flushed when main() exits, all data
printed with printf() will appear at that time, if it has not already.  However,
ANSI C does not require that a stream be flushed when scanf() is called
on it.  Therefore, if you print to a fully buffered stream and then request
input on it, it is likely that the input will be read before the printed
data appears.
<P>
You can control the buffering algorithm used for a particular stream with
the setvbuf() function.  For example, the statement setvbuf(stdout, NULL,
_IOLBF, BUFSIZ) sets standard output to be line-buffered, which is what
most Unix programmers expect.  Any decent C reference will cover all of
this material.

After reading one too many bug reports about this phenomena, the gcc/2 maintainer
changed its stdout to not-buffered whenever stdout is interactive.  When
stdout is sent to a pipe or file, stdout is still fully-buffered.
