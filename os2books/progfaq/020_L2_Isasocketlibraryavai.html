<H1>Is a socket library available?  How can I use it?</H1><!-- entering slot 24 -->
<P>
emx 0.9a supports sockets without the Programmer's Toolkit.  The socket
support of emx is `seamless': fdopen(), for instance, can be used on sockets.

<P>
IBM's TCP/IP 2.0 ($200) includes an optional Programmer's Toolkit ($500,
part #02G6973).  It includes a socket library, and support for Sun RPC,
NCS RPC, and a limited Kerberos capability.  It requires IBM C-Set++ or
another compiler that understands 16-bit code.
<P>
For REXX programs there is a socket library called REXXSOCK available from
cdrom.com as os2/ibm/ews/rxsock.zip.  It can be used to write TCP/IP applications
such as Gopher, IRC, etc.
<P>
FTP Software, Inc., has an OS/2 version of its TCP/IP product.  They can
be reached at (617) 246-0900 or info@ftp.com.
<P>
If you have the IBM TCP/IP 2.0 base package and IBM C-Set++, you can use
the TCPIPDLL.DLL directly.
