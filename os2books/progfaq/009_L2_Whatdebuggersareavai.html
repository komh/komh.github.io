<H1>What debuggers are available for OS/2?</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
IPMD, a PM-based debugger, ships with C-Set++.  It is capable of source-
and assembly-level debugging multithreaded 16 bit and 32 bit OS/2 applications

<P>
emx/gcc comes with gdb 4.11, the GNU debugger.
<P>
Borland C++/2 comes with a PM-based debugger called Turbo Debugger GX which
has the same basic functionality as IPMD.
<P>
There are also several commercial debuggers on the market.  WATCOM C and
FORTRAN come with WVIDEO, a full-screen source or assembly level debugger
that handles multithreaded 16 and 32 bit OS/2 programs. Multiscope (no longer
available for 32-bit OS/2) and Periscope are others.  CodeView is still
applicable for 16-bit OS/2 apps, but it is not recommended for 32-bit apps.
