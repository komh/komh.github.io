<H1>Can I distribute the C-Set++ runtime DLL?</H1><!-- entering slot 26 -->
<P>
Yes, you can! (But it is not as simple as that really...)
<P>
You can not distribute the runtime DLL that comes with C-Set++ in its native
form, you must rebuild the DLLs you want to distribute and delete functions
in the .DEF files, so that your DLL files only contains functions your program
need. Read more about this topic in<I> C/C++ Tools - Programming Guide</I> pages
195-222, that comes with C-Set++ (2.x).
