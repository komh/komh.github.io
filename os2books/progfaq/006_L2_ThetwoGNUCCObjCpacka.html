<H1>The two GNU C/C++/ObjC packages</H1><!-- entering slot 10 -->
<P>
The two versions of GNU C that are available were ported to OS/2 with different
goals and philosophies in mind and therefore have different characteristics.
 However, both systems include a fairly complete C library and can be used
to compile useful programs, although their support of Unix-specific semantics
differs.  Furthermore, both systems are being actively developed and are
constantly improving.
<P>
The goal of GCC/2 is to create a pure, freely redistributable OS/2 2.x development
environment.  It is based on GNU C 2.5.4, supports C, C++, and Objective
C, and can create PM programs.  It produces "native" 32 bit .OBJ files that
are linked with OS/2's LINK386.EXE, and can be linked together with .OBJ
files produced by IBM C-Set++ and other compatible compilers.  The mailing
list os2gcc@netcom.com exists for discussion of this port; send mail to
os2gcc-request@netcom.com for subscription information.
<P>
emx/gcc 0.9a, based on the GNU compiler 2.x.x, supports C, C++, and Objective
C and can create PM programs.  emx's goal is to make porting Unix programs
easier by emulating Unix semantics as closely as possible. It produces programs
that can run under OS/2 using EMX.DLL, it produces programs that can run
under OS/2 without any DLL requirements (linked with OS/2's LINK386), and
it can produce MS-DOS 32-bit executables (emx.exe DOS extender required
for MS-DOS executables).  emx/gcc uses standard Unix development tools like
ld and nm, and fully supports Unix-isms like select() and fork().  A version
of gdb exists that can debug emx/gcc programs. An emx-related mailing list
exists; send mail to LISTSERV@eb.ele.tue.nl with a message body of "help"
for subscription information.
