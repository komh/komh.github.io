<P>
Currently, you can get the same effect with PM if you use the method used
with icons:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Use a monochrome mask to prep the destination
area. The mask would define which areas would be transparent and which would
show the bitmap. The bits would be defined as 1=transparent,0=bitmap. You
would blit the mask to the destination using ROP_SRCAND. This would blacken
out the area that would display the non-transparent bits of the bitmap.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Now blit the bitmap to the destination using
ROP_SRCPAINT. Note that the "transparent" areas of the bitmap must have
the color black (i.e. bits=0). This ORs the bitmap onto the prep area. Viola
- "transparent" bitmap.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
