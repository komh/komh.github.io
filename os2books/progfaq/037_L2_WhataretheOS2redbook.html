IBM publishes so-called "redbooks" on many products, including OS/2 2.x.
 They seem to be a combination of power-user's guides and design information
that may be of use to both users and programmers [I haven't received my
copies yet, so I cannot say for sure.]  These are usually intended only
for special IBM customers and contain documentation that is generally unavailable
anywhere else.  You can order these books directly from IBM (see below).
 All of the following names are implicitly preceeded by "OS/2 Version 2.0."
