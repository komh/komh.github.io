A tool called Mirrors is available from Micrographx.  It does not currently
support Windows 3.1-specific programs and calls.  (although you *can* call
the functions in the new 3.1 DLLs)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>Rough ports can be done in under 1 day, but a detailed
port still costs you a lot of effort.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>The ported application is heavily dependent
on the underlying OS/2 system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
There are also several toolkits available that allow you to make calls to
a common API library, and your source will work across the two platforms
without any changes at all.

However, if you want to bite the bullet and port it, then be prepared to
make a lot of changes.  Just like porting regular DOS programs, you will
have to scrap most, if not all, of your user interface.  Your core code,
if modular and abstract enough, should come through the port relatively
unscathed.

SMART - by One-up Corp is also available on Developers Connection CD.
