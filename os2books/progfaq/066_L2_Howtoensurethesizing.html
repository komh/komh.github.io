<P>
Override wpclsQuerySettingsPageSize (or some such verbage, I don't have
docs at home).  I don't know if this API made it into the on-line docs,
but it is definitely public (see \TOOLKT20\C\OS2H\WPOBJECT.H). There you
are given the opportunity to adjust the size up to accomodate your dialog,
if necessary.
<P>
The PAGEINFO structure is used by the Settings page code to delay the loading
of the dialog required for a page until the user turns to it for the first
time.  It has the resource ID, module handle (which is incorrectly named
in the structure, 'resid' or some nonsense, grr-r), dialog procedure, and
pointer of your choice to receive on WM_INITDLG (most choose the object
pointer, somSelf). When the user selects the notebook tab, WPS calls WinLoadDlg
based on the parameters in PAGEINFO.
