<H1>Is OS/2 suitable for real time programs?</H1><!-- entering slot 145 -->
<P>
Yes!  There is a special priority you can assign your programs (ForegroundServer
Mode) via DosSetPriority() which will give your process (note, not thread,
but process) the maximum allowable CPU time.
<P>
Another route is to use DosEnterCritSec()/DosExitCritSec().  Calling the
former will disable thread switching (hopefully for a short period of time),
and calling the latter will enable thread switching again.
