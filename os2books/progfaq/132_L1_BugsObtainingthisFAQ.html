With the advent of all this nifty hypertext IPF stuff, there are bound to
be bugs and errors in this FAQ, simply by Murphy's Law.  (Anything that
can go wrong, will go wrong)  If you find an error, however, insignificant,
<I>please</I> send me a note (through one of the ways listed below) telling
me what's wrong with the FAQ.

This FAQ is distributed in two versions, ASCII and INF.  The INF version
is binary and viewable only by the VIEW.EXE program that comes with OS/2.
 The ASCII version is text and is viewable by any program that can view
text (which includes most word processors).  The filename is PFAQnn.ZIP,
where 'nn' is the FAQ version.
