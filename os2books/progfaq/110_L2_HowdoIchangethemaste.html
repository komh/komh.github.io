<H1>How do I change the master environment?</H1><!-- entering slot 130 -->
<P>
Quick and simple answer: you don't.
<P>
In OS/2 it is literally impossible for you to change the master environment
from one of your programs.	To be able to do so would fatally disrupt the
programming paradigm that has existed for ages: <I> Your program does not
alter the master environment. Your program is the slave, not the master.
</I> Therefore, no capability was built into OS/2 to facilitate this.
<P>
There is, however, a kludge.
<P>
As you know, a .CMD file can alter the master environment.  This is the
nature of batch files (ok, so I'm a MS-DOG dinosaur and still call them
batch files instead of command files or scripts).  Therefore, you can place
a sequence of commands in the batch file that will take your program's output
and alter the environment of your current shell.
<P>
That's as close as you are gonna get to the master environment.  You can
always create your own sort of environment variables, in the form of shared
memory or named pipes.
