Mention of a product does not constitute an endorsement.  Customers outside

This FAQ is freely distributable for noncommercial purposes.  (For commercial
purposes, please contact the author.)  If you redistribute the FAQ, please
include all the original files.
<P>
This FAQ is updated quarterly and is distributed through various computer
networks and online services, including the Internet and many BBSes.
<P>
Both ASCII text and OS/2 Information Presentation Facility (INF) versions
of the FAQ are provided.  To view the INF version of the List, go to any
OS/2 command line prompt (e.g. double click on "OS/2 Window") and type:

<PRE>VIEW PROGFAQ.INF
</PRE>

<P>
The ASCII text version may be viewed using any text editor, word processor,
or file listing utility.  The text version is intended to answer any questions
you may have before actually obtaining and using OS/2.  You will find that
the INF version provides a much more attractive interface, with hypertext
links, fast indexing, and, increasingly, illustrations.
<P>
If you have not received all three files (README.CMD, PROGFAQ.INF, and PROGFAQ.TXT),
please ask your system operator to make sure he/she is receiving the correct
and complete package.
<P>
Many of the answers in this FAQ refer to anonymous ftp site FTP-OS2.CDROM.COM
(192.153.46.2). The name 'cdrom.com' is used as a shorthand to refer to
this site.  It has become, by default, the Internet storehouse for OS/2
files.  If you cannot get files from this site (for whatever reason), then
check <A HREF="131_L1_OS2SoftwareSources.html">OS/2 Software Sources</A> for
a source near you. You may find a more convenient method of getting files
<!-- entering slot 1 -->than from cdrom.com.  (Non-US readers will note
ftp.luth.se, is the main overseas FTP site.)
