<P>
Several compilers come with their own VGA graphics libraries.  A 3rd party
developer has even developed an SVGA library (with drivers) for emx/gcc.

<P>
Full-screen graphics programming is nearly identical to full-screen DOS
graphics programming, with the notable exception that you must lock and
unlock the screen under OS/2 before you can use it.
<P>
For fast direct-access screen graphics, check at ftp-os2.cdrom.com, the
file dlib06.zip.
