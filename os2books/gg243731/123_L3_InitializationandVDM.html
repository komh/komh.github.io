<H1>Initialization and VDM Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 130 -->
<P>
Initialization of the DOS Emulation component is divided into two stages.
 The first occurs during OS/2 system initialization. The second stage occurs
during creation of each virtual DOS machine.
<P>
<B>OS/2 Initialization</B>
<P>
DOS Emulation is involved in OS/2 system initialization because it requires
access to information contained in CONFIG.SYS. As the OS/2 initialization
procedure processes the CONFIG.SYS file, it records parameters relevant
to DOS Emulation. These parameters include those specified in the FCBS and
RMSIZE statements, and any DEVICE statements which specify DOS device drivers.
These parameters become the default DOS settings for all VDMs.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Virtual device drivers are not loaded or initialized at this
stage. Initialization of DOS settings occurs prior to loading virtual device
drivers, since these default settings may be required by the device drivers
during VDM initialization (creation).
<P>
<B>VDM Creation Stage</B>
<P>
Upon creation of a VDM, the Virtual DOS Machine Manager calls the creation-time
initialization routines for virtual device drivers and then passes control
to the DOS Emulation kernel. At this point, the V86 memory organization
appears as shown in <A HREF="021_L2_V86MemoryMapPriortoD.html">Figure "V86
Memory Map Prior to DOS Emulation Initialization"</A>.
<P>
During VDM creation, DOS Emulation performs the following steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Initialize VDM-Related Kernel Structures</I>
<P>
Certain structures in the OS/2 Version 2.0 kernel are initialized in preparation
for processing VDM requests. The System File Table (SFT) structures, for
example, which are used for FCB I/O, are allocated and initialized.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Load DOS Emulation Kernel (DOSKRNL.COM)</I>
<P>
The portion of the DOS Emulation kernel which runs in V86 virtual memory
is loaded at the high end of the VDM memory address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Start Virtual Processor Mode</I>
<P>
The protected mode initialization routine returns control to the Virtual
DOS Machine Manager, which then invokes the initialization code within the
V86 mode DOS Emulation kernel. This represents the first transition to V86
mode; at this point, memory is organized as in <A HREF="022_L2_V86MemoryMapatInitia.html">Figure
"V86 Memory Map at Initial V86 Mode Entry"</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Open Standard Devices</I>
<P>
The initial five file handles (stdin, stdout, stderr, stdaux, and stdprn)
are opened.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Initialize Virtual Device Driver DOS Device
Driver "stubs"</I>
<P>
Some virtual device drivers provide a DOS device driver "stub";  these stubs
are inserted into the V86 address space prior to initialization of DOS Emulation.
As such, this step involves calling the inserted initialization code and
linking the devices into the device chain. Unlike real DOS device drivers,
however, the return from the initialization does not allow reducing the
size of the driver code. See <A HREF="143_L1_DeviceDrivers.html">Device
Drivers</A> for further information.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Initialize DOS Device Drivers</I>
<P>
Each DOS device driver specified in the CONFIG.SYS file is loaded into the
VDM and initialized. Any VDM-specific DOS device drivers passed in the DosCreateProcess()
function call, or configured via the DOS Settings option<I> DOS Device Drivers</I>,
are then loaded and initialized. This is performed one device driver at
a time to allow the device drivers to consume only the memory that they
require or to de-install themselves entirely. As each device is initialized,
it is added to the chain of devices in the VDM.
<P>
During initialization, device drivers may issue a limited set of INT 21h
system calls (functions 01h through 0Ch, 25h, 30h, and 35h). This restores
<!-- entering slot 131 -->functionality that had been removed from previous
versions of OS/2.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> The result is undefined when a DOS device driver issues an
INT 21h system call other than those mentioned above. This is consistent
and compatible with DOS. Issuing an unsupported INT 21h system call will
crash the VDM.
<P>
After all device drivers have been initialized, the initialization code
is discarded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><I>Load and Execute DOS Shell</I>
<P>
The shell specified in the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS is loaded, the initialization
code in the V86 address space is discarded, and control is passed to the
shell program. The SHELL specified in CONFIG.SYS can be overridden in the
<B>DosCreateProcess()</B> function call. This is a useful feature if, for
example, a software developer wishes to allow different versions of COMMAND.COM,
for such reasons as alternative national language support.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Upon invocation of the shell program, the VDM's memory map is organized
as shown in <A HREF="023_L2_V86MemoryMapafterIni.html">Figure "V86 Memory
Map after Initialization"</A>.
<P>
Before passing control, the<B> Program Descriptor Block</B> (PDB) of the
shell is initialized with the command line parameters as specified in CONFIG.SYS.
As an extension to the native DOS environment, an additional string is appended
after these parameters, separated from the command line string by a NULL
byte. This string specifies the drive and directory of the virtual DOS environment
after the shell completes its initialization.  This extension provides a
default working drive and directory for real mode applications, as is provided
for protect mode applications using the Presentation Manager.
