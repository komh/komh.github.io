There is a way to check the environment size without the use of special
programs like ENVIRON.EXE and QENV.BAT.  It is not simple because we cannot
display the environment size by using a command.
<P>
The SET command shows all the current settings in the environment of COMMAND.COM.
 The environment size defaults to approximately 150 bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->To make sure that the environment buffer is full,
issue some environment settings like:
<PRE>SET a=12345678901234567890
SET b=12345678901234567890
SET c=12345678901234567890
 :    :   =       :                   :
 :    :   =       :                   :
 :    :   =       :                   :</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Execute the SET commands until you encounter
an error message "Out of environment space".<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Now, save the environment settings in a file.
 The syntax for this action is as follows:
<PRE>SET  &gt;  MYENV.TXT</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Check the size of the new file (MYENV.TXT) with
the DIR command:
<PRE>DIR  MYENV.TXT</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->From the file size displayed by the DIR command,
subtract the number of lines in MYENV.TXT.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This is necessary because each line in the file is terminated by CrLF (0D0A)
characters and the environment strings are terminated by a single character
(hex 0) only.
<P>
If you can use this method and calculate a size at 200, you did very, very
well.
