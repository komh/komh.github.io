<H1>Virtual COM Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 175 -->
<P>
The virtual COM device driver VCOM.SYS provides virtual support for the
serial communication I/O ports and for the serial channel-related CBIOS
entry points.  It provides support in each VDM for up to two communication
channels on the IBM PC AT and compatible systems, and up to four on the
IBM PS/2 Model 80 and compatible PS/2 systems.
<P>
VCOM only supports access to communication channels which are physically
present on a given system.  It does not include support for accessing communication
devices which may be redirected by network software.  For each supported
port, VCOM searches for the port's base address in the CBIOS data area.
 If the address is zero, indicating that the device is not present or is
owned by a physical device driver other than the COM.SYS device driver,
VCOM does not attempt to support that serial device.
<P>
If the port's base address is found, VCOM verifies that the physical device
driver has installed itself for that serial device.  If the physical device
driver indicates it is not installed for that port, VCOM does not attempt
to support that serial device.
<P>
Many DOS applications that support asynchronous communications include hardware
interrupt handler routines.  These routines typically perform I/O directly
to the COM port hardware. To support these DOS applications and to allow
them to run in both background and foreground, VCOM simulates hardware interrupts
in the task-time context of the V86 mode process. VDMs are scheduled and
dispatched using the same preemptive task dispatching method that drives
OS/2 processes.  Hardware interrupts on the other hand, occur asynchronously
to this scheduling process.  By simulating hardware interrupts and presenting
a virtual hardware state, the interrupt handling logic of the DOS application
does not execute on the physical interrupt thread.  This means that switching
to V86 mode is not done at interrupt time, but is deferred until the scheduler
dispatches the VDM task.
<P>
The advantage of simulated interrupts is that mode switching and hardware
virtualization need not be done at interrupt time.  In addition, the DOS
application does not gain control at interrupt time, which helps to maintain
system integrity.  A potential disadvantage of this approach is that DOS
applications with time-critical routines may not operate correctly under
some system load configurations.
<P>
<B>Port/Channel Contention</B>
<P>
After VDM creation, the CBIOS data area provides a logical link between
the virtual communication channels in the VDM and the physical serial channel
hardware.  Since VCOM does not support a COM port if its address is not
in the CBIOS area, it can handle its own errors and/or terminate in its
usual fashion if the DOS application does not find the device address.
<P>
If the CBIOS area indicates that the device is present, however, VCOM determines
if the device is already in use in another VDM when the DOS application
makes its first access to that device.  If so, VCOM does not attempt to
send the OPEN command to the physical device driver.  Instead, VCOM will
issue a pop-up message that informs the user of the resource contention
and allows for a user-selected action.  As a result of the user action,
the conflict is resolved or the VDM may be terminated.
<P>
If the port is not already in use, VCOM calls the physical device driver
with the OPEN command.  This command will succeed provided the port is not
currently in use by a protected mode process.
<P>
Once the device is opened, VCOM communicates directly with the physical
device driver to perform all virtual hardware operations.  These include
sending and receiving data, detection and simulation of hardware interrupts,
and<!-- entering slot 176 --> setting or querying the status and control
registers.
<P>
<B>CBIOS Access</B>
<P>
VCOM also supports access to CBIOS COM port services through software interrupt
14h.  Rather than allowing the CBIOS to perform the functions by accessing
the virtual I/O ports directly, VCOM emulates CBIOS functions. The CBIOS
access emulation supports six functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Initialize</B>
<P>
The initialize function establishes the communication speed and framing
options for the channel, and returns the modem and line status.  To specify
bit rates of greater than 9600 bits per second, the<I> extended initialize
</I>function must be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Extended Initialize</B>
<P>
The extended initialize function, like the initialize function, establishes
the communication speed and framing options for the channel and returns
the modem and line status.  This function is used if a bit rate of 19,200
bits per second (or greater) is desired,  or if<I> space</I> or<I> mark
</I>parity selection is desired.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Send Character</B>
<P>
The send character function sends a character to the communication channel.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Receive Character</B>
<P>
The receive character function waits for a character from the communication
channel and returns the character.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Read Status</B>
<P>
The read status function returns the modem and line status.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Extended Port Control</B>
<P>
The extended port control function sets or reads the modem control register.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
DOS applications running in VDMs may access these functions using the standard
INT 14h service, in a manner identical to that used in a native DOS environment.

<P>
<B>Virtual Interrupt Indication</B>
<P>
The DOS application must properly enable interrupts and the specific interrupt
type before the interrupt will be simulated to the VDM.  The following INS8250
interrupt types are virtualized by VCOM:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Line Status Interrupt<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Receive Data Available Interrupt<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Transmitter Holding Register Empty Interrupt<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Modem Status Interrupt.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When the physical device driver notifies VCOM of an interrupt, VCOM passes
a virtual interrupt to the Virtual Programmable Interrupt Controller, which
in turn simulates the interrupt to the VDM.
<P>
To maintain high performance on the physical serial channel, the COM physical
device driver typically does not notify the VCOM on every interrupt.  Rather,
VCOM receives notification of certain events, and determines whether to
begin or continue simulating interrupts to the VDM.
<P>
<B>Coexistence with Other Serial Device Drivers</B>
<P>
Since there is always the potential for other device drivers to own a serial
port, VCOM does not assume ownership of any devices for which the physical
COM device driver has not been installed.  For example, a serial mouse device
driver may be installed and may own the COM1 serial port.  The COM physical
device driver will not install for this port, and VCOM will therefore support
only the higher numbered serial ports (if installed).
<P>
If a physical device driver installs itself and zeros the COM port base
addresses in the CBIOS data area, VCOM does not attempt to initialize for
that COM port and will not assume any responsibility to virtualize the serial
device hardware for that port.  This may result in problems for certain
DOS applications which rely on the CBIOS data area in order to access multiple
serial ports.
