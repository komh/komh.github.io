<H1>Virtual Keyboard Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 166 -->
<P>
The Virtual Keyboard Device Driver VKBD.SYS provides virtualization support
for the keyboard.  It allows keystrokes to be passed from the keyboard to
virtual DOS machines.  It also allows for text to be pasted into the VDM
as key strokes.
<P>
Upon creation of the VDM, VKBD establishes communication with the physical
keyboard device driver and initializes the portions of the CBIOS data area
associated with the keyboard.  Subsequently, the physical device driver
notifies VKBD of each scan code that is bound for the VDM.
<P>
To allow monitoring of I/O activity, VKBD registers itself with the 8086
Emulation component.  8086 Emulation then notifies VKBD when a DOS application
in a VDM accesses a virtual keyboard port.
<P>
VKBD supports two virtual I/O ports:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Port 64h - Controller Status/Command<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Port 60h - Controller Input/Output Buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These two ports may respond to requests in a variety of ways, depending
on the state of the controller at the time of the request.
<P>
<B>Read Output Buffer</B>
<P>
An I/O read request to port 0x60 reads the contents of the controller output
buffer. If the "output-buffer-full" status was set before the read request,
a timer (T1) is started.  The output-buffer-full status is then cleared.
 When the T1 timer expires, VKBD determines if another byte is ready to
be placed into the output buffer.  If so, the byte is placed into the output
buffer and the "output-buffer-full" status is set.
<P>
<B>Write Output Buffer</B>
<P>
An I/O write request to port 0x60 writes the specified byte to the controller
input buffer.  The previous contents of the input buffer are lost.  The
port number (0x60) is saved and the byte written is processed, depending
on the current state of the keyboard controller.  The "input-buffer-empty"
status is never set.
<P>
<B>Status Read</B>
<P>
An I/O read request to port 0x64 simply returns the contents of the controller
internal status register.  Reading this port has no effect on the state
of the virtual keyboard hardware.
<P>
<B>Write Controller Command</B>
<P>
An I/O write request to port 0x64, like a write request to port 0x60, writes
the specified byte to the controller input buffer.  Since the port number
(0x64) is saved here, the system distinguishes between a command byte and
a data byte.  As above, the byte written is processed, depending on the
state of the controller, and the "input-buffer-empty" status is never set.

<P>
<B>Physical Device Driver Notification</B>
<P>
Since keystrokes are external events, it is the responsibility of the physical
device driver to notify VKBD when keystrokes are available for processing.
 In particular, the physical device driver calls VKBD when hardware scan
codes arrive, and passes each scan code received to VKBD. This occurs whenever
the keyboard's current focus is a virtual DOS machine.
<P>
When called, VKBD places the scan code in a queue.  If the queue was previously
empty, the controller "output-buffer-full" status condition is set and if
interrupts are enabled, the Virtual Programmable Interrupt Controller is
called to simulate the interrupt to the VDM.  If the queue was not previously
empty, the scan code is added without any other processing.  If the queue
is full, the speaker is sounded.
<P>
<B>INT 09h Processing</B>
<P>
In a "real" DOS environment, the IRQ1 interrupt request is translated by
the interrupt controller, causing the INT 09h interrupt service routine
to be invoked.  This interrupt vector normally points to a routine in the
CBIOS. This manner of processing is not desirable in a VDM since the CBIOS
only performs U.S. key translation; such processing would complicate the
task of national language support.  Instead, VKBD simulates this CBIOS function,
and may thus use<!-- entering slot 167 --> whatever key translation is appropriate
for the current country and code page.
<P>
The INT 09h emulation code within VKBD performs all functions that the CBIOS
would normally perform.  This includes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Key and scan code enqueueing<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->INT 05h (Print Screen) processing<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->INT 15h processing for monitoring scan codes and handling
the SysReq key<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->INT 1Bh for Ctrl+Break and Pause key processing<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Key translation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Update of keyboard LEDs<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Update of the CBIOS data area status.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Upon termination, VKBD relinquishes access to the keyboard.
