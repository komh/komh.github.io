<H1>Real Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 238 -->
<P>
<B>Real Mode: </B> An operating mode that Windows runs in to provide maximum
compatibility with versions of Windows applications prior to 3.0. Real mode
is the only mode available for computers with less than 1MB of extended
memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
<A HREF="443_L2_realmode.html"><B>Real mode</B></A> is equivalent to previous
versions of Windows (2.x), and can address 640KB of conventional memory,
plus LIM EMS Version 4.0 expanded memory.  Extended memory can be used for
a virtual disk or disk caching only.
<P>
Real mode requires an 8088 processor or above, and 640KB of installed memory.
 Real mode requires 384KB of free conventional memory after DOS and other
memory resident software, including network drivers, is loaded.
<P>
Real mode is supported for Windows and its applications under OS/2 Version
2.0, in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The WIN-OS/2 kernel provided by OS/2 Version 2.0 may
be used to run Windows applications in real mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The commercially available Windows 3.0 product may
be run in real mode in a VDM, and real mode applications started from within
this VDM by the Windows Program Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that the commercially available Windows product<I> cannot</I> be run
in standard or enhanced modes in a VDM due to Windows' memory management
architecture; Windows assumes that it is a DPMI host and cannot act as a
DPMI client.  Many Windows applications run quite adequately in real mode;
in fact, some applications written for Windows 2.x cannot run in any other
mode.
