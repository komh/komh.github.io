<P>
After starting the first session of the SOUND.EXE program, the speaker will
produce some more or less beautiful noise.  Starting a new VDM session with
SOUND.EXE will prevent the first session's SOUND.EXE from executing because
it is switched to the background (the speaker system is not virtualized!).

<P>
The second session cannot access the speaker because it is blocked until
it is granted access to the speaker.
<P>
You cannot terminate the program by pressing "Enter" because the "PLAY"
instruction (refer to the program listing in <A HREF="069_L2_SOUNDBASSourceCode.html">Figure
"SOUND.BAS Source Code"</A>) could not be completed.
<P>
If the first session is switched back to the foreground, it resumes execution.
 Pressing "Enter" ends session 1 and now session 2 has access to the speaker
and begins to play the music.
