<H1>Windows Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 236 -->OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability for Windows
applications to run under OS/2 Version 2.0, using its WIN-OS/2 component.
 With this support, applications written for Windows 3.0 and Windows 2.x
can coexist and execute with OS/2 and DOS applications in the same machine
under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>

Running under OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>
<P>
Each Windows application executes as a protected mode process within a VDM.
As such, Windows applications are subject to the same application protection
facilities provided to other protected mode applications (both OS/2 and
MVDM tasks) under OS/2 Version 2.0.  Windows applications are protected
from other Windows applications and from DOS and OS/2 applications executing
in the system.  This is in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment,
where protection is limited to DOS applications (Windows applications share
a common address space), and is only available when Windows is running in
standard or 386 enhanced modes.
<P>
The execution of Windows applications in a protected environment allows
these applications to take full advantage of the pre-emptive multitasking
capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0, with full pre-emptive multitasking between
Windows applications, OS/2 applications and DOS applications.  This is again
in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment, where pre-emptive multitasking
is available only for DOS applications and only when Windows 3.0 is running
in enhanced mode, thereby impacting performance and preventing many applications
written for previous versions of Windows from executing.  OS/2 Version 2.0
has no such restriction.
