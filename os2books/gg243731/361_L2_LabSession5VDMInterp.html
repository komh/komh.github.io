<H1>Lab Session 5: VDM Interprocess Communications</H1><!-- entering slot 416 -->
<P>
The objective of this lab is to show that an OS/2 session can exchange data
with a DOS session in the same system.
<P>
In this exercise, you are required to start an OS/2 application program
that first creates a number of "named pipes".  The OS/2 application  then
waits for a DOS BASIC program to connect to the pipe.  This connection is
performed by one thread.  Afterward, the main OS/2 program sends data to
change the screen colors of various (connected) DOS BASIC programs.
