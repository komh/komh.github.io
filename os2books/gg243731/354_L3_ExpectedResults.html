<P>
After you have successfully completed the exercise, please note that the
interrupt INT 19h did not reboot the system. Instead, the interrupt was
routed to the Virtual DOS Machine Manager (VDMM) by the General Protection
Handler. The VDMM terminates the VDM when receiving the INT 19h.
<P>
If you start a DOS application program from an OS/2 command prompt, control
is passed to the Virtual DOS Machine Manager which then starts the VDM.
Execution of INT 19h does<B> NOT</B> terminate the OS/2 session. Instead,
INT 19h terminates the VDM session only.  Control is returned to the OS/2
session.
<P>
The INT19.EXE is a compiled BASIC program.  The source code is shown in
<A HREF="067_L2_INT19BASSourceCode.html">Figure "INT19.BAS Source Code</A>."
