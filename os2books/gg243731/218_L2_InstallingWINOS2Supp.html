<H1>Installing WIN-OS/2 Support Under OS/2 Version 2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 250 -->
<P>
Windows application support is provided by default during the installation
of OS/2 Version 2.0.  If the user wishes not to install Windows support,
the appropriate option must be chosen during OS/2 installation.
<P>
The OS/2 installation program detects the video resolution of the machine
on which it is being installed.  If Windows support is selected during "first
time" installation, then the following configurations will be applied according
to the detected video resolution:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>CGA, EGA</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> Configured for full-screen (only)
Windows support.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> VGA</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> Configured
for "seamless" WIN-OS/2 VDM support.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> 8514/A,
XGA</B><!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> During installation, a panel with the option
to select seamless support (and downgrade to VGA graphics mode) is provided
(see <A HREF="045_L2_InstallingWindowsSup.html">Figure "Installing Windows
Support under OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>).  If full-screen (only) Windows support
is selected, then the higher resolution is maintained.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Readers should check the<I> ReadMe</I> file in the<I> Information
</I>folder for the latest information on this subject.  This folder contains
information on how to reconfigure the system to have seamless WIN-OS/2 support
as well as high resolution MAVDM and/or SAVDM sessions.  Additional support
information for SVGA display device drivers will be provided as well. <I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 1:  Control Program</I> also discusses several installation
and configuration aspects of OS/2 V2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
When Windows support is selected at installation time, all the files necessary
to provide this support are installed in the following subdirectories:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>OS2\MDOS\WINOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><LI>OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
If the user decides to install Windows application support, DOS application
support is automatically installed.  OS/2 Version 2.0's CONFIG.SYS file
is updated to include the above directories in the PATH statement.
<P>
Since Windows real mode requires 640KB of conventional memory and several
MB of expanded memory (EMS), the EMS virtual device driver is also required.
 If the user did not select standard mode at installation time and wishes
to add it at later time, the OS/2 Version 2.0 CONFIG.SYS must be modified
by adding the following statements:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VDPMI.SYS (DOS Protect Mode Interface)
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VDPX.SYS (DOS Extender Virtual
Device Driver).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If these device drivers are not loaded, the Windows kernel will execute
in real mode.
<P>
Windows can use expanded memory which conforms to the LIM EMS 4.0 specification
when running in real mode. This memory is primarily used for storing background
applications.  In a DOS/Windows environment, an appropriate Expanded Memory
Manager must be installed.  Under OS/2 V2.0 this is not necessary, as the
virtual device driver already provides that service. In standard mode, Windows
may also use extended memory (XMS).
