<P>
ATM provides WYSIWYG text to all OS/2 V2.0 PM and WIN-OS/2 supported printers
and displays. WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) implies that what you
see on the display is what you will see on the printed page. In reality,
a 75 dot per inch display<I> can not</I> show you what a 300 dot per inch
printer will produce. It is physically impossible. What it will give you
is fully formed characters in virtually any size and a sense of the "balance"
of the page with respect to line, word and letter spacing. With ATM you
have the ability to install and use any of the hundreds of Type 1 Fonts
compatible with the PostScript** Page Description Language. Thirteen Type
1 fonts are included in OS/2 V2.0 in four font groups (Times New**, Helvetica**,
Courier and Symbol). This group provides a satisfactory basic working set,
to which extra fonts can be added.
<P>
With ATM, users now have a wider choice of fonts, and can display and print
them even on lower-cost devices. For example, PostScript-quality fonts can
now be printed on non-PostScript devices such as the IBM 4019 and 4029,
and the HP** LaserJet** series without the need to add the additional PostScript
interpreter option. You still get excellent results, though slower performance,
as the fonts will be rasterized in the PS/2 rather than the printer. Even
an IBM 4201 or an IBM 5152 or other low-cost matrix printers can print Type
1 fonts but, of course, not with the same quality as laser printers. These
same fonts can also be "installed" as downloadable fonts to be sent to PostScript
printers for faster print performance.
<P>
The list of available fonts for<I> most</I> applications is a combination
of the list in the printer device driver you have selected for output and
the fonts you have installed in the ATMs. Tests with Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows,
Aldus** PageMaker, and DeScribe** indicated that as soon as additional fonts
were installed in the Font Palette of OS/2 PM and the ATM Control Panel
of WIN-OS/2, all of these applications were able to include them in their
font choice list, display them and print them. Some applications like CorelDraw!**
2.0 and Micrographx** Designer use their own internal outline format for
fonts. They will use the same Type 1 fonts as ATM but the fonts must be
installed seperately in each application. Consult your application documentation
to determine how each one handles fonts.
