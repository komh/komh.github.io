<H1>Virtual Video Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 184 -->
<P>
VDM video activity consists of both port I/O and memory operations. Virtual
video device drivers are provided to support concurrent operations by multiple
VDMs.  A number of virtual video device drivers are provided by OS/2 Version
2.0, and are installed depending upon the physical display adapter types
present in the system:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->VCGA.SYS provides support for CGA devices<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->VEGA.SYS provides support for EGA devices<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
In the following discussion, the term<I> VVIDEO</I> will be used generically
to refer to all virtual video device drivers.
<P>
By trapping all I/O operations and mapping a virtual video memory buffer
to the region where a VDM expects physical video memory, VVIDEO insulates
the physical hardware from background VDM  activity.  Only a foreground
VDM's video operations are allowed to write directly to the physical hardware.

<P>
The major IBM adapter types (MONO, CGA, EGA, VGA, XGA and 8514) are fully
supported by VVIDEO, in that it supports all standard modes of operation
for multiple VDMs (concurrently, if all VDMs are running in text modes).

<P>
The following is a list of the video configurations supported and their
default mode of operation:
<P>
<A HREF="073_L2_ListofSupportedVideo.html">Table "List of Supported Video
Configurations"</A>
<P>
As in a native DOS environment, the default setting of the equipment flags
determines which display adapter is the primary display.  VVIDEO examines
this to determine which will be the primary display. The video signal for
secondary displays is initially disabled, until such time as a MODE command
or user application explicitly enables it.
<P>
<B>VDM Screen-Switching</B>
<P>
The OS/2 Version 2.0 session manager informs VVIDEO whenever a VDM's display
state changes, ensuring that no more than one foreground VDM exists at any
point in time, and that no VDMs are regarded as foreground processes while
any other protected mode process, including the operating system shell,
is in foreground.  This mutually exclusive activity relationship between
VVIDEO and OS/2 display drivers ensures screen integrity.
<P>
VDMs in background are switchable at any time since their state is maintained
in memory by VVIDEO, rather than in the device itself.  32KB of virtual
video buffer memory is allocated by VVIDEO for each VDM upon creation.  This
is the maximum buffer size addressable in any text mode. When the VDM is
switched to foreground, the video buffer is reallocated to the maximum size
supported by the adapter, with a limit of 256KB.
<P>
The act of switching a VDM from foreground to background or vice versa requires
that the calling routine yield control, and hence there may be a time delay
during the switch.  In order to preserve the integrity of the video buffer,
the VDM is suspended for the duration of the screen switch, to avoid any
portion of the video state that was already copied to or from the hardware
being changed before the switch is complete.
<P>
<B>Foreground VDM Support</B>
<P>
There are literally no limits to what a VDM can do with video hardware when
running in foreground, since it<!-- entering slot 185 --> has complete access
to all ports and device memory through VVIDEO.  I/O trapping is still operative,
but only to "shadow" changes and ensure the ability to switch screens.
<P>
<B>Background VDM Support</B>
<P>
VDMs running in the background must always use virtual video memory, which
is actually normal system memory that has been mapped into the VDM's video
address space.  In cases where the selected video mode (typically a graphics
mode) requires multiple planes of video memory, normal system memory is
inadequate to effectively virtualize video memory.
<P>
Whenever a VDM running the in background places the video hardware in a
multi-plane graphics mode, virtual video memory is invalidated and if touched,
results in the VDM being "frozen". If the VDM returns to a single-plane
video mode (implying that it never accessed video memory), then its virtual
video memory is validated once more.  This approach allows VDMs to switch
between different text modes entirely in background, without the risk of
being frozen.
<P>
To support graphics operation in the background, VVIDEO must trap all video
memory references and remap them to a set of simulated planes, or use some
form of hardware-assisted virtualization that Presentation Manager and the
other OS/2 processes know nothing about.
<P>
<B><I>Suspended Background VDM:</B></I>  There are three cases in which
DOS graphics applications may be suspended (receive no processor time) when
running in the background:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A DOS multiplane graphics application that uses
advanced graphics, such as 640x480x16 or 640x350x16, will be suspended,
regardless of the graphics adapter installed, if any other DOS application
is running in the foreground in a full-screen session.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A DOS multiplane graphics application that uses
advanced graphics, such as 640x480x16 or 640x350x16, will be suspended when
a Presentation Manager session is running in the foreground in XGA mode.
Currently, this situation occurs even if you have an Extended Graphics Array
(XGA) and a Video Graphics Array (VGA) adapter connected to your system.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A DOS multiplane graphics application that uses
1024x768x16 graphics mode will be suspended when a Presentation Manager
session is running in the foreground in 8514/A mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that suspending DOS applications running in the background generally
poses no problems unless the applications are timing-dependent, such as
communications or process-control applications. In these cases, suspending
them may cause them to fail. Avoid this situation by running these applications
in the foreground in full-screen sessions only. If they are graphics applications,
run them only in a single-plane mode, such as 640x200x2, 320x200x256, or
640x480x2, in full-screen sessions.
<P>
Note also that for WIN-OS/2 sessions, set the VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION
DOS setting to ON to avoid having Windows programs suspended when running
in the background.
<P>
<B><I>Graphical Applications Programs Support:</B></I>  OS/2 Version 2.0
supports a broad variety of display-adapter hardware as you can see from
<A HREF="074_L2_GraphicalApplication.html">Table "Graphical Applications
Programs Support under OS/2 Version 2.0"</A>. This allows OS/2 programs,
DOS programs, and Windows programs to run in both windowed and full-screen
sessions. OS/2, DOS, and Windows programs can run successfully in both the
foreground and the background.  Normally, the OS/2 user need not be concerned
with the graphics modes that are used within a program, or whether a program
will run successfully in a background session.
<P>
Some types of display<!-- entering slot 186 --> adapters do, however, place
limits on the ability of the OS/2 operating system to run certain classes
of DOS and Windows graphics programs in the background. The limits exist
because of the difficulty of providing virtual access to the display-adapter
hardware without disturbing either the foreground session or other background
sessions.
<P>
Under certain conditions, DOS applications that use graphical display modes
will become suspended in background sessions when they attempt to write
to the display.
<P>
<A HREF="074_L2_GraphicalApplication.html">Table "Graphical Applications
Programs Support under OS/2 Version 2.0"</A> gives you an overview of what
happens with graphical applications programs in combination with different
display adapters.
<P>
To determine under what conditions your applications will run in a background
session in <A HREF="074_L2_GraphicalApplication.html">Table "Graphical Applications
Programs Support under OS/2 Version 2.0"</A> as described now:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Find your graphical display hardware in the "Type
of Video" column.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Find your System Desktop Mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Read across the table to your application column.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
For example, assume you have a DOS application using VGA mode on a system
with VGA video. The application is in full-screen. To determine if the application
will be suspended:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Find your type of video (VGA) in the "Type of
Video" column.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Find your System Desktop Mode (VGA).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Read across the table to your application column
(DOS Application, Matches Desktop Mode, Full-Screen).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The PF indicates that the DOS application runs when PM has control of the
screen or when the application is in a foreground session.
<P>
<B>Device-Independent Pointer Services</B>
<P>
VVIDEO provides services which allow the virtual mouse driver to define
a pointer image and specify its position.  Since the position must always
be given relative to the physical dimensions of the VDM's screen, and since
coordinates may change whenever the video mode is reset, the virtual mouse
driver provides an entry point which is notified of such changes by VVIDEO.
These interfaces are device-independent because dimensions are always given
in terms of pixels or character cells, and not in predefined video mode
identifiers.  By separating the pointer-drawing code from the virtual mouse
driver, mouse support becomes automatically available on any video adapter.

<P>
<B>Font Support</B>
<P>
At VDM creation time only a single font exists; this is either a default
font contained in video ROM, or one specified by OS/2 if code page support
is active.  In the latter case, VVIDEO automatically loads the OS/2 code
page font whenever the VDM restores the default ROM font by resetting the
video mode.
<P>
Note that since the process of loading a font is essentially the same as
entering a graphics mode, background VDMs will "freeze" if they attempt
this.
<P>
<B>Clipboard Support</B>
<P>
To transfer VDM screen contents to the clipboard, VVIDEO provides two services:
one to return the VDM's video configuration, and a second to copy the video
contents to a shell-supplied buffer address.  The shell then handles the
transfer from this buffer to the clipboard.
