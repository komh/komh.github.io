<P>
The virtual programmable interrupt controller VPIC.SYS is a virtual device
driver responsible for virtualization of hardware interrupts to virtual
DOS machines.  This device driver simulates interrupts to virtual DOS machines
by providing a virtual interface to the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller
(PIC).
<P>
The virtual PIC device driver supports the hardware interrupt-related services
needed by virtual device drivers and DOS Sessions.  The services include
setting handlers to trap EOI and IRET events, simulating interrupts to DOS
Sessions, and handling PIC I/O accesses by DOS Sessions.  The virtual PIC
device driver maintains a per-DOS Session virtual PIC state so that each
DOS Session appears to have its own independent 8259 Programmable Interrupt
Controller.
<P>
This per-DOS Session virtual PIC state contains items such as the current
mask, the current IR (interrupt request) and IS (interrupt service) registers,
base interrupt vector and initialization mode for a particular VDM.  A per-VDM
state machine is used to track the initialization control word (ICW) or
operation control word (OCW) for which VPIC is waiting.  This module also
invokes the virtual device driver's EOI handler when it receives EOI commands
from a VDM.
<P>
The interrupt simulation mechanism is similar to the way signals are handled
for OS/2 applications. The virtual PIC device driver can be broken up into
two major parts:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The virtualization of the PIC ports, and<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The simulation of hardware interrupts to VDMs.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="031_L2_VirtualProgrammableI.html">Figure "Virtual Programmable
Interrupt Controller"</A> below shows this breakdown and the interfaces
to other components, it shows the VPIC architecture and the role it plays
in virtualizing hardware interrupts to virtual DOS machines.
<P>
Not all combinations of ICWs or OCWs are supported.  Some seldom used initialization
modes and operation commands are ignored.  These unsupported features are:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Slave PIC on any IRQ other than IRQ2<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Level-triggered initialization<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Special fully nested mode<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Auto EOI mode<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->8080/8085 mode<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Buffered mode<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The following tables show in detail which 8259 PIC initialization and operation
commands from a VDM are supported by the VPIC. <A HREF="071_L2_PICInitializationCon.html">Table
"PIC Initialization Control Words"</A> shows the supported and unsupported
initialization control words.
