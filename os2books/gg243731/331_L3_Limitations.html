<P>
The limitations of running Personal Communications/3270 for Windows under
OS/2 V2.0 should be noted:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If Personal Communications/3270 for Windows is
started after OS/2 V2.0 LAN requester is running, it will cause the LAN
requester to fail.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->File transfer can only be performed from the
virtual DOS machine in which Personal Communications/3270 for Windows is
running.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The adapter card used by Personal Communications/3270
for Windows for communication with the host cannot be accessed by another
program. Since the 802.2 device driver is not (yet) virtualized, Personal
Communications/3270 for Windows has direct access to the Token-Ring card.
No other LAN services can be made available via another program using the
same card.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> A possible solution for this problem could be to install
a second Token-Ring adapter. However, this will not help because the LAN
Support Program will try to initialize both Token-Ring adapters, if installed.
This can cause trouble for OS/2 device drivers which are using the second
adapter at the same time.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->You need to run the program
RESETOKN.EXE before starting this virtual DOS machine and after closing
this virtual DOS machine. This will reset the adapter and make it available
to another process. If you don't use RESETOKN, the Personal Communications/3270
for Windows virtual DOS machine cannot be stopped and restarted, as the
IEEE 802.2 device driver is not (yet) virtualized.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
