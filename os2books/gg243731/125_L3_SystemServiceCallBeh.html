<H1>System Service Call Behavior</H1><!-- entering slot 133 -->
<P>
DOS system services provided within VDMs are generally compatible with their
implementation under DOS 5.0. Some differences do exist, however, and are
described below.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>INT 20h</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> This service forwards the request
to the INT 21h function 00h service in order to abort the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> INT
21h</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> All INT 21h services provided in DOS 5.0
are also provided in VDMs. However, the internal behavior and error processing
of some functions may be different. Where such changes are significant,
they are listed here:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
00h (ABORT)</B>
<P>
If the CS register does not reference the current PDB, the VDM is terminated.
In certain previous DOS versions, the effect of such a call was undefined.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>FCB Functions</B>
<P>
Although OS/2 only provides file I/O access externally through file handles,
it supports these handles internally through the System File Table (SFT).
MVDM allows file handles to be bypassed and SFT entries to be manipulated
directly using a special set of reserved SFT entries, in a manner similar
to previous versions of OS/2. However, since multiple VDMs are supported,
these SFT entries are allocated dynamically upon creation of a VDM
<P>
FCB functions may now be called from device drivers during initialization;
this functionality was not available in previous versions of OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
38h (International)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
44h (IOCTL)</B>
<P>
IOCTL requests which are destined for device drivers within the VDM are
processed internally. IOCTL requests which are destined for OS/2 device
drivers, however, are treated specially by their respective device drivers.
Such requests may contain pointers to data within the VDM. In these cases,
it is the responsibility of the OS/2 device driver to perform the necessary
translation from V86 virtual addresses into addresses that are meaningful
to the device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
5Dh (Internal)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 8 --><I>Subfunction 0Ah (Set Extended Error Information)
</I>
<P>
This subfunction allows the calling program to set the register values that
are returned from a call to function 59h. This provides functionality that
was not present in previous versions of OS/2.
<P>
This subfunction allows terminate and stay resident programs (TSRs) to save
and restore extended error information when they are invoked.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
66h - Get/Set Code Page</B><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><B>Function
67h - Set Handle Count</B>
<P>
This function restricts the maximum number of open device handles to 254,
including the four standard devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> INT
25h/INT 26h</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Absolute Disk Read/Write
<P>
The read function operates in the same way as in a DOS 5.0 system.  The
write function however, is restricted to removable media only, and reports
a hard error on non-removable media.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
