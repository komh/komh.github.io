<H1>XMS Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 398 -->
<P>
The following is a brief summary of LIMA XMA functions.  This is a summary
of the specification itself, and not of its implementation in OS/2 Version
2.0.
<P>
<B>Determining XMS Presence</B>
<P>
Calling interrupt 2Fh with AH=43h and AL=00h will return AL=80h if an XMS
driver is installed.  Calling interrupt 2Fh with AH=43h and AL=10h will
return the<I> far</I> entry point address of the XMS control function in
ES:BX.  The control function<I> must</I> be called as a<I> far</I> procedure.
<I></I>
<P>
<B>Requesting/Releasing HMA</B>
<P>
There is only one 64KB HMA and it cannot be divided.  An application which
requests the HMA is given the entire HMA, even if it uses only part of it.
When an application has successfully requested the HMA, it is guaranteed
sole access to it until it is released.  As part of the request, the application
indicates how much of the HMA it expects to use.  If this value does not
exceed a user-specified threshhold, the request is denied.  This test is
performed so that the HMA is given only to applications which make substantial
use of the HMA.
<P>
<B>A20 Address Line Control</B>
<P>
Two pairs of functions are used to control the status of the A20 address
line.  The application may control the A20 address line either globally
or locally.  Global control is used by programs which have control of the
HMA. Local control is used by programs which need to access extended memory
directly.  Global settings are kept in a simple on/off flag, whereas local
control uses a counter.  Hence, the number of "local disable" calls must
equal the number of "local enable" calls before the A20 line is actually
disabled, whereas a single "global disable" call suffices to disable the
A20 address line, regardless of how many "global enable" calls have been
made.
<P>
<B>Allocating/Reallocating/Deallocating Extended Memory Blocks</B>
<P>
An allocation request can be made for a particular-sized EMB (in kilobyte
units) and, if successful, an EMB handle is returned.  This handle is used
to reallocate, lock, unlock, or deallocate memory.  It is also used to move
memory between the EMB and conventional memory or other EMBs.  An EMB may
be locked and while locked, it may not be reallocated or deallocated, nor
may its base address change.
<P>
<B>Allocating/Deallocating Upper Memory Blocks</B>
<P>
An allocation request can be made for a particular-sized UMB (in paragraph
units) and, if successful, the segment number of the UMB is returned, as
well as the actual size of the UMB.  This segment number is also used to
deallocate the UMB.  UMBs may not be resized.
<P>
<B>Information Calls</B>
<P>
The application can obtain information about the XMS memory resources available
and handle usage.  In a multiprogramming environment or where TSRs are loaded,
this information may be out of date before being used. For instance, an
application may determine the amount of XMS memory available, but before
getting the opportunity to request an allocation, a TSR may request XMS
memory.  The application would find less memory available than expected.

<P>
<B>Data Movement</B>
<P>
A move or copy function provides<!-- entering slot 399 --> data movement
between any combination of conventional or extended memory.  The memory
being affected need not be locked.  The start of a region of extended memory
is indicated by handle and offset.  Overlapping copies will succeed provided
the source address is below the destination address.  Moreover, blocks being
moved must be of even length; word alignment is not required, however.  This
function is the only method of accessing an extended memory block without
leaving real mode.
