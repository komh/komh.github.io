<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If OS/2 Version 2.0 Extended Services is used,
the OS/2 version of PC Support must be run instead of the Basic DOS version,
as the device drivers used by DOS PC Support/400 requires exclusive control
of any adapter used for DOS communications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->When a Virtual Machine Boot session is started
from a diskette image file, the "A:" drive within the VDM will refer to
the diskette image file. If you would like to access the physical drive
"A:", OS/2 V2.0 supplies a program called FSACCESS.EXE to do this. See the
online command reference for more information.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The default hot-key of Alt-ESC is reserved for
OS/2 V2.0 and must be changed in order to have hot-key support. This can
be done by  using the Configure WorkStation Function (CFGWSF.EXE) program
to create/change a keyboard profile.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

Virtual Machine Boot session while the LAN router is active, you must wait
two minutes before starting up the VDM again. This time will allow the card
to reset itself on the LAN. The DOS PC Support/400 VDM will appear to hang
if it is restarted too soon.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->For an SDLC router, if you decide to close the
Virtual Machine Boot session while the router is active, you must stop the
router or power off the modem first. Failing to do so could cause a system
trap to occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
