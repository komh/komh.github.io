<H1>Using the Migrating Applications Facility</H1><!-- entering slot 319 -->
<P>
Many common DOS applications can be set up on the Workplace Shell with their
virtual DOS machine customized automatically by using the<I> Migrate Applications
</I>facility of the<I> Systems Setup</I>. There is a file in the<I> \OS2\INSTALL
</I>subdirectory called<I> DATABASE.DAT</I> that contains information on
commonly available DOS, Windows V3.0 and OS/2 Version 1.3 applications.
For DOS and Windows V3.0  applications this file includes the recommended
<I>DOS settings</I> for the virtual DOS machine setup for that application.

<P>
After installing the DOS application, start the<I> Migrate Applications</I>facility
and follow the dialog boxes to select the DOS application. If the migration
is successful, an icon will be created for the application in a folder called
<I>DOS Applications</I>.
<P>
Refer to <A HREF="199_L1_InstallingandMigrati.html">Installing and Migrating
Applications</A> on using the<I> Migrate Applications</I> program.
