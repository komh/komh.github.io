about what publications are considered to be product documentation.
<P>
References in this publication to IBM products, programs or services do
not imply that IBM intends to make these available in all countries in which
IBM operates.  Any reference to an IBM product, program, or service is not
intended to state or imply that only IBM's product, program, or service

specified, and is limited in application to those specific hardware and
software products and levels.

The information contained in this document has not been submitted to any
formal IBM test and is distributed AS IS. The information about non-IBM
("vendor") products in this manual has been supplied by the vendor and IBM
assumes no responsibility for its accuracy completeness. The use of this
information or the implementation of any of these techniques is a customer
responsibility and depends on the customer's ability to evaluate and integrate
them into the customer's operational environment.  While each item may have
been reviewed by IBM for accuracy in a specific situation, there is no guarantee
that the same or similar results will be obtained elsewhere.  Customers
attempting to adapt these techniques to their own environments do so at
their own risk.
