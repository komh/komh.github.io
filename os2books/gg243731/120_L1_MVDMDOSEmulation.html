<P>
MVDM DOS Emulation provides DOS services to applications running in Multiple
Virtual DOS Machines. The environment provided is highly compatible with
those same services that are provided to DOS applications running under
native DOS 5.0. It addresses only DOS compatibility aspects; processor and
other hardware aspects of the DOS environment are addressed by the 8086
Emulation component and virtual device drivers.
<P>
This chapter describes the implementation of the DOS Emulation component,
and the DOS software services provided to support DOS applications running
in virtual DOS machines.
