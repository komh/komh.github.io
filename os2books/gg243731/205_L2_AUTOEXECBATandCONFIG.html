<H1>AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS</H1><!-- entering slot 230 -->
<P>
The installation program for a DOS or Windows application may alter the
AUTOEXEC.BAT (usually to modify the PATH statement) and CONFIG.SYS (to modify
the FILES and BUFFERS statements or add a DEVICE statement). Usually the
copies edited are the ones found in the root directory of the OS/2 V2.0
boot drive. If the option is given the user should not allow the installation
program to make the modifications before reviewing the changes. We recommend
that you back up both of these files prior to running an installation. After
installation, inspect the date and time stamps of the files to see if they
have been modified.
<P>
The most common change made to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is to the PATH statement,
so that the program being installed can be started from any subdirectory.
The function of the PATH statement can be provided in a virtual DOS machine
by using the<I> Path and file name</I> and<I> Working directory</I> fields
of the<I> Program</I> page of the<I> Settings</I> notebook.
<P>
Since the CONFIG.SYS is used for every virtual DOS machine, the device driver
that an installation program adds will be loaded for all VDMs and consume
system resources unnecessarily. We recommend that when the DOS application
is added to the Workplace Shell the device driver statement be added via
the<I> DOS_DEVICE</I>  setting  in the DOS Settings facility. This setting
is accessed by pressing the<I> DOS Settings</I> push button on the<I> Session
</I> page of the<I> Settings</I> notebook.
