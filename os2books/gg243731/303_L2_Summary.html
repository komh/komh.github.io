<P>
The DOS Settings feature of MVDM provides the user with the ability to selectively
configure and tune the virtual DOS machine environment to meet the requirements
of particular applications.  Since some DOS applications require certain
features while other applications operate better without them, a VDM may
be individually configured to provide the optimum execution environment
for the application which will run within it.
<P>
DOS settings may be set by the user when adding an application to a group
on the desktop, or in certain cases, during execution while an application
is running within the virtual DOS machine.  In the case where a VDM is created
by another process using a<B> DosStartSession()</B> function call, a buffer
may be provided containing the required DOS settings and their values.
