<H1>DPMI Services</H1><!-- entering slot 297 -->
<P>
The following is a brief outline of the DPMI services.  For details regarding
invocation of DPMI services from an application via INT 31h, please refer
to the<I> DPMI 0.9 Specification</I>.
<P>
DPMI provides six main classes of services:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Local Descriptor Table management<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Memory management<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Page management<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Interrupt management<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Translation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Debug watchpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each of these services is briefly described in the following sections.
<P>
Note that DPMI services are normally never called by an application program
itself, but are intended to be used by DOS extenders which request DPMI
services on an application's behalf.
<P>
<B>LDT Descriptor Management Services</B>
<P>
The LDT descriptor management service provides interfaces for allocating,
freeing, and creating protected mode descriptors in the current task's Local
Descriptor Table (LDT).  Access to the Global Descriptor Table is not provided,
so that the DPMI server can protect itself from protected mode applications
and isolate these applications from one another.
<P>
<B>DOS Memory Management Services</B>
<P>
The DOS memory management services provided an interface from protected
mode applications to real mode INT 21h functions which are used to allocate,
free and resize memory blocks.  These services allow a protected mode applications
to use memory below 640KB, to exchange data with DOS, ROM BIOS device drivers,
TSRs and other real mode programs which are incapable of accessing data
in extended memory.
<P>
<B>Extended Memory Management Services</B>
<P>
The extended memory management services are used to allocate, free and resize
memory blocks above the 1MB boundary.  If the DPMI server is an 80386 or
80486 control program and paging is enabled, the extended memory blocks
are always allocated in units of 4KB.
<P>
<B>Page Management Services</B>
<P>
Under DPMI implementations which support virtual memory, applications may
discard memory blocks or may not access them for long periods of time, in
which case the memory block's contents may be swapped out to disk.  In certain
circumstances, such as interrupt handling code, this swapping must be disabled
and the appropriate pages locked in physical memory.  The page management
services allow pages to be individually locked or unlocked.
<P>
<B>Interrupt Management Services</B>
<P>
These services allow protected mode applications to intercept real and protected
mode interrupts and hook processor exceptions.  Certain services allow a
protected mode program to intercept hardware or software interrupts which
occur in real mode or protected mode, or to install handlers for processor
exceptions.  Other interrupt services permit a process to enable or disable
its own servicing or hardware interrupts without affecting the interrupt
status of the entire system.  DPMI accomplishes this by maintaining a virtual
interrupt flag on a per-process basis.
<P>
<B>Translation Services</B>
<P>
The translation services permit control to be passed between operating modes.
 A protected mode program may transfer control to a real mode routine using
a simulated far call or a simulated interrupt.  Translation services also
allow a protected mode program to declare a real mode callback, or entry
point which can be invoked by the a real mode program.
<P>
<B>Debug Watchpoint Services</B>
<P>
The 80386 processor supports special registers that are used for debugging.
Since the instructions to modify these registers can only be executed by
code running at privilege level zero, protected mode debugging tools running
in DPMI environments cannot modify the registers<!-- entering slot 298 --> directly.
 These services provide mechanisms for setting and clearing debug watchpoints
and detecting when a watchpoint has caused a fault.
