<H1>Additional Setup for LAN Connections</H1><!-- entering slot 377 -->
<P>
The LAN connections require some additional device drivers in order to communicate
with the adapter.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> When PC/3270 is using a LAN Adapter, then that adapter cannot
be used by any other program on this workstation. At this time there is
no virtual IEEE 802.2 device driver available to allow adapter sharing,
which means that PC/3270 will have exclusive use of this adapter when it
is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
We will set up PC/3270 to use a Token-Ring adapter. You could set it up
to use Ethernet, PC Network or 3174 Peer (LAN over Coax) using the same
technique.
