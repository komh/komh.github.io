<P>
In the case of a MAVDM, the Windows Program Manager is loaded in the VDM,
transparently to the user.  The Program Manager's window is displayed maximized,
and applications are then launched from the Windows Program Manager.  In
this case, the Workplace Shell's Window List will display the name of the
Windows kernel (WINOS2.COM) executing in the VDM.  It will not show each
individual Windows application running within that MAVDM.  This is different
from a SAVDM, where the Workplace Shell's Window List will display the name
of the Windows application.
