<H1>Starting a DOS Application</H1><!-- entering slot 320 -->
<P>
A DOS application can be started in a virtual DOS machine by a user in one
of several ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By double-clicking mouse button 1 on the application's
representative object on the desktop or in a folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By starting the application from an OS/2 or DOS command
line<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->By running an OS/2 batch file containing the<I> Start
</I>command with the appropriate switches<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that an OS/2 application may also start a DOS application by issuing
a<B> DosExecPgm()</B> function call. The DOS application can be started
as a dependent or independent child process of the OS/2 application.
<P>
There are certain limitations to starting DOS programs from an OS/2 V2.0
command prompt. For example, neither output redirection (using the "&gt;"
character) nor piping (using the "|" character) works as it would from a
DOS command prompt. When starting a DOS application from the OS/2 command
prompt, OS/2 Version 2.0 calls the DOS command processor (COMMAND.COM),
which then receives the application's name and parameters and starts it.
The OS/2 V2.0 command processor does not start the application itself but
transfers all control to the DOS COMMAND.COM. When we use redirection or
piping from the OS/2 command prompt, it is only effective for the OS/2 session.
Since OS/2 starts COMMAND.COM, and not the DOS application itself, OS/2
will only redirect the output of COMMAND.COM, not the application.
<P>
Thus with a DOS program XYZ, neither:
<PRE>XYZ &gt; DUMMY.FIL
</PRE>

<P>
nor:
<PRE>XYZ | more
</PRE>

<P>
would work from the OS/2 command prompt the way it does from a DOS command
prompt.
<P>
One solution to the above limitation is to put the redirection or piping
statement into a DOS batch file and call the batch file instead.
