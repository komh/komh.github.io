<P>
Applications which experience memory constraints under DOS may overcome
many of the inherent limitations of real mode by running protected mode.
However, an application running in protected mode cannot easily access the
facilities of real mode software such as the DOS operating system or TSR
programs.  DPMI provides an interface which allows an application to execute
in protected mode, and to make DOS requests through DPMI.  All mode switching
and address conversion is handled by DPMI on the application's behalf.
<P>
DPMI resolves problems relating to device virtualization, intertask protection,
and demand paging that occur when multiple protected mode DOS extender applications
are run in a multitasking environment, in conjunction with memory managers
and control programs.
<P>
DPMI is implemented under OS/2 Version 2.0 using a combination of virtual
device driver services and kernel services to provide DPMI functions to
client applications.  The provision of these functions allows applications
written to use DPMI services, such as applications which run under Microsoft
Windows in standard mode, to run in a VDM under OS/2 Version 2.0.
