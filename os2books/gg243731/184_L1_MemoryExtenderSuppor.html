<P>
Many popular DOS applications use memory extenders such as EMS and/or XMS
to gain access to memory above the 1MB real mode addressing limit on the
80286, 80386, or 80486 processors.  Such extenders allow DOS applications
to have total code and data spaces larger than the available base memory,
and to have very large code or data objects loaded into memory for enhanced
execution speed.  The standard configuration of OS/2 Version 2.0 provides
both LIM EMS Version 4.0 (which includes backward compatibility with LIM
Version 3.X) and LIMA XMS Version 2.0 functions for DOS applications running
in virtual DOS machines.

This chapter describes the implementation of EMS and XMS support for virtual
DOS machines.  For those readers not already familiar with the architecture
of these memory extenders, an overview is provided in <A HREF="339_L1_MemoryExtenderArchit.html">Memory
Extender Architectures</A>.
