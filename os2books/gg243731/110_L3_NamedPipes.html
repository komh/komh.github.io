<H1>Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->Named pipes enable related or unrelated processes
on the same computer system or different systems to communicate with each
other. Any process that knows the name of a pipe can open and use a named
pipe. In addition, named pipe data can be transparently redirected across
a network, such as a local area network (LAN).
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> The current file system implementation for VDMs does not
support named pipes across the LAN. (This limitation will go away with future
versions of OS/2 V2.0). To use named pipes within a VDM and across the LAN,
you would have to boot a real DOS session (see also <A HREF="304_L1_VirtualMachineBoot.html">Virtual
Machine Boot</A>). You would also have to load the LAN Support Program and
the DOS LAN Requestor within such a VMBOOT session. If you do that, your
network adapter will be used by that DOS session exclusively and cannot
be shared with any other session on this machine.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
One process (<I>server process</I>) creates the pipe and connects to one
end of it.  Other processes that access the named pipe are called<I> client
processes</I>; they connect to the other end of the pipe.  The server and
client processes can then pass data back and forth by reading from and writing
to the pipe.  The server process controls access to the named pipe.
<P>
The client process can be either local or remote.  A local client process
is one that runs on the same computer system as the server process.  A remote
client process runs on a different system and communicates with the server
process across a local area network (LAN).
<P>
The DOS applications running in different VDMs can only work as client processes.
The OS/2 application for this kind of IPC has to be the server process.
That is because there are no equivalent pipe APIs in DOS to create a named
pipe, etc. there are only the standard I/O commands. This means that the
DOS client process can read and write from and to the pipe, but it cannot
create one.  To do this the DOS client has to know the name of the named
pipe to be able to use it like it would use a flat file to open it and process
the I/O calls.
<P>
There is an exercise included in the appendixes that demonstrates a VDM
IPC and shows you the sample code (see <A HREF="361_L2_LabSession5VDMInterp.html">Lab
Session 5: VDM Interprocess Communications</A> for more information).
