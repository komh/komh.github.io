<H1>Requesting System Services</H1><!-- entering slot 132 -->
<P>
As previously mentioned, MVDM isolates some VDM-specific code and places
it into the DOS Emulation kernel in the VDM's address space. This code provides
those DOS services which can be supported in V86 mode, such as memory management
services. Other services which require protected mode execution are provided
by additional code which runs in protected mode.
<P>
When the DOS Emulation kernel requires protected mode services, it specifies
the kernel procedure via an index, and executes a processor instruction
which causes a general protection exception. The OS/2 Version 2.0 general
protection exception handler traps the exception and invokes the 8086 Emulation
component, which in turn transfers control to the specified kernel procedure.
This is explained in detail in <A HREF="112_L1_8086Emulation.html">8086
Emulation</A>.
