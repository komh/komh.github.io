<P>
A SAVDM is created for the execution of a single Windows application.  The
Workplace Shell actually starts WINOS2.COM as the application in the VDM,
and the application to be started in the VDM is passed as a parameter to
WINOS2. This process is transparent to the user; the definition of the SAVDM
in the<I> Settings</I> notebook uses the Windows application name only.

<P>
If WINOS2 is to execute in real mode, the<B><I> /r</B></I> option will be
automatically inserted into the parameter list for the VDM creation, based
on the WIN-OS/2 settings.  If standard mode was highlighted,<B><I> /s</B></I> is
passed as a parameter to WINOS2.  The default is to pass no Windows options,
only the application name.
<P>
When the Windows application is terminated, WINOS2.COM terminates, which
in turn causes the VDM to be terminated.
