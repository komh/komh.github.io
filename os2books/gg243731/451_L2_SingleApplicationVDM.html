Single Application VDM
<P>
Method of running Windows applications under OS/2 Version 2.0, whereby a
virtual DOS machine is created for each Windows application.  The application
runs within this VDM, and is protected from any other application running
in the system.  This is the recommended way to run Windows applications
if not running seamlessly on the Workplace Shell desktop.
