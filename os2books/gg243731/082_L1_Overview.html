A significant new feature of IBM* OS/2* Version 2.0 is the ability to execute
multiple DOS applications concurrently, with pre-emptive multitasking and
full memory protection for each application.  Microsoft** Windows** applications
are also supported in the same way.  These capabilities allow the use of
OS/2 Version 2.0 as an integration platform for DOS applications, Windows
applications, and OS/2 applications in a seamless, fully functional environment.

<P>
This chapter provides a brief overview of the OS/2 Version 2.0 product and
the Multiple Virtual DOS Machines component which provides support for DOS
and Windows applications.  DOS and Windows application support is then described
in more detail in the remainder of the document.
