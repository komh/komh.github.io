EMS handle
<P>
EMS implementations must provide for between 64 and 255 virtual memory objects
that can be allocated by EMS applications.  Each memory object is referred
to by an associated EMS handle.  A handle to an object is returned when
an allocation request is granted.  Allocation is in page sized units.  Handles
can be named, allowing sharing between processes.
