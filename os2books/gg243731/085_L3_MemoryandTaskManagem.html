<H1>Memory and Task Management</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
The foundation for OS/2 Version 2.0 capabilities is its support for the
Intel 80386 microprocessor. This support means that a powerful set of 32-bit
features now becomes available to the operating system and applications,
including enhanced memory management and more sophisticated multitasking.

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 requires the features of the Intel 80386 or compatible
32-bit microprocessors, and therefore does not run on computers that use
the Intel 80286** processor, or its predecessors.  In order to maintain
compatibility, however, OS/2 Version 2.0 supports applications written for
previous versions of OS/2 by providing both a 16-bit as well as a 32-bit
application programming interface, allowing 16-bit applications to execute
under OS/2 Version 2.0 without modification.  The Intel 80386 can address
4 gigabytes of physical memory and up to 64 terabytes of virtual memory.

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 supports execution of the following types of applications:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DOS applications, in full-screen mode or in window-mode
on the Presentation Manager desktop.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Microsoft Windows applications, in windows on the
Presentation Manager desktop.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->16-bit OS/2 applications developed for previous versions
of OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->32-bit applications developed for OS/2 Version 2.0.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
All applications execute as protected mode processes under OS/2 Version
2.0, and are therefore provided with pre-emptive multitasking and full memory
protection between processes.
<P>
<I>Memory management</I> is the way in which the operating system allows
applications to access the system's memory.  The operating system must check
how much memory is available to an application, and handle the event when
there is no longer any real memory left to satisfy an application's requests.

<P>
In OS/2 Version 2.0, memory management has been enhanced to provide a <A HREF="411_L2_flatmemorymodel.html"><B>flat
memory model</B></A>, which takes advantage of the 32-bit addressing scheme
provided by the Intel 80386 architecture.  This means that through memory
management, the system's memory is seen as one large linear address space
of 4GB.  This 32-bit programming environment is free from the limitations
and inherent complexity of the segmented memory model used by DOS and previous
16-bit versions of OS/2.  Memory management within applications is greatly
simplified, allowing applications to be developed faster, with better performance
due to reduced memory manipulation overhead.  Through the use of the flat
memory model, applications may be more easily ported to or from other operating
system platforms.
<P>
<I>Task Management</I>, the management of processes and threads executing
in a system,  is greatly simplified and streamlined under OS/2 Version 2.0.
This is due primarily to the fact that support for processes executing in
real mode (such as the DOS Compatibility Box in previous versions of OS/2)
is no longer required, since the execution of DOS applications is supported
using virtual DOS machines which run as protected mode processes under OS/2
Version 2.0.
<P>
Interrupt handling under OS/2 Version 2.0 is simplified by removal of the
need to handle real mode software interrupts.  Interrupts issued by DOS
and Windows applications are trapped by a <A HREF="473_L2_VirtualProgrammableI.html"><B>virtual
programmable interrupt controller (VPIC)</B></A> which translates the interrupts
to the appropriate device access commands for the protected mode environment.
 The virtual programmable interrupt controller is described in <A HREF="143_L1_DeviceDrivers.html">Device
Drivers</A>.
