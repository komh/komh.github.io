<H1>Extended Memory Manager</H1><!-- entering slot 212 -->
<P>
XMS services are implemented under MVDM using a virtual device driver known
as the <A HREF="409_L2_ExtendedMemoryManage.html"><B>Virtual Extended Memory
Manager</B> (<B>VXMM</B>)</A> which is represented by the file VXMS.SYS
(VXMS). VXMM provides a separate XMS emulation for each VDM by placing most
VXMS control structures in a per-VDM data area outside the V86 mode address
space. The amount of memory available to a VDM, the number of handles, and
the existence of Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) are all configurable parameters
which may be altered on a per-VDM basis.
<P>
The VXMM hooks interrupt vector 2Fh in order to announce its presence to
applications. It also provides a V86 stub device driver (XMM 3X device driver),
which indicates to DOS applications that XMS is available, but more importantly
acts as a V86 mode interface between the application and the VXMM proper.

<P>
VXMM depends heavily upon the memory manager.  XMS object allocation reallocation,
and deallocation are accomplished by requesting corresponding services from
the memory manager.  When an application requests the allocation of a block
of extended memory, for example, VXMS asks the memory manager to allocate
a memory object in linear memory outside any VDM.  Reallocation and deallocation
are handled similarly.
<P>
All EMS functions are executed by calling the XMS Control Function, the
address of which can be obtained by a call to INT 2Fh. Arguments are passed
in registers.
<P>
<A HREF="035_L2_ExtendedMemoryManage.html">Figure "Extended Memory Manager
Control Flow"</A>
<P>
During the initialization of the VDM the VDM Manager loads and initializes
the XMM DOS stub device driver into the VDM address space. As soon as there
is a XMS request the VDM Manager loads the the XMS virtual device driver
VXMS.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a)<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>The VDM Application issues a INT 15h service request.
VXMS directly hooks INT 15h for function 87h and 88h. It does not provide
any services through these calls but makes sure that no program tries to
use extended memory directly. INT 15h function 88h will respond that no
normal extended memory is available. Programs that want to use extended
memory directly by using INT 15 and RAMdisks (electronic disks) using INT
15 won't work. The MS DOS RAMDRIVE for DOS 5.0 does work because it uses
XMS instead of INT 15.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Like VEMM and unlike most other virtual device drivers, VXMS.SYS does not
have a corresponding physical device driver.  Instead, it depends heavily
upon the OS/2 Version 2.0 memory manager.  XMS object allocation, reallocation
and deallocation are accomplished by requesting corresponding services from
the operating system's memory manager.  For example, when an application
requests the allocation of a block of extended memory, VXMM requests the
memory manager to allocate a memory object in linear memory outside the
V86 mode address space.  Reallocation and deallocation are handled similarly.

<P>
<B>Structure</B>
<P>
The VXMS.SYS module<!-- entering slot 213 --> consists of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->An<I> initialization component</I> that initializes
global structures and reads the global configuration at boot time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A<I> router component</I> that receives control

as required by the specifications, in order to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

</UL>  4.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>A
number of<I> service routines</I>, which perform the required XMS functions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Applications request XMS services by calling a subroutine contained within
the VXMM, known as the Control Function.  The VXMS virtual device driver
hooks interrupt vector 2Fh in  order to announce its presence to applications.

<P>
<B>Initialization</B>
<P>
VXMS.SYS may be loaded at system initialization time by using a DEVICE=
statement in CONFIG.SYS, as shown below:
<PRE>DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VXMS.SYS 8192, 2048</PRE>

<P>
This statement should be placed in CONFIG.SYS<I> after</I> the DEVICE= statement
for VEMM.SYS, since VXMM queries VEMM to ensure that no conflicts occur
in memory allocation.
<P>
The DEVICE= statement uses parameters to specify the total amount of available
XMS memory, and the default limit for each VDM.  In the above example, the
overall limit is set to 8MB and the limit for each VDM is set to 2MB.
<P>
The virtual device driver VXMS.SYS can be configured as follows.
<PRE>       device = {path} vxms.sys {options}
</PRE>

<P>
The options are of the form "/keyword=value":<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B><LI>XMMLIMIT=g,i</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Sets the global (system-wide)
maximum memory usage of the VXMS.SYS driver to g kilobytes, and a per-VDM
maximum of i kilobytes.  These values should be large enough to accommodate
an automatic 64KB allocation in each VDM for the HMA.  Values are restricted
to the range 0..65535 (= 64Meg).
<P>
The values of g and i are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 4.
<P>
Specifying i = 0 suppresses XMS installation in all VDMs unless specifically
overridden by a VDM-specific configuration string.  (See below.)
<P>
Default:  /XMMLIMIT=4096,1024<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /HMAMIN=d</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Sets
the minimum request size (in kilobytes) for an HMA request to succeed.  Values
are restricted to the range 0..63.
<P>
Default: /HMAMIN=0<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /NUMHANDLES=n</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Sets
the number of handles available in each VDM. Each handle occupies eight
bytes.  Values are restricted to the range 0..128.
<P>
Default: / NUMHANDLES=32<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /UMB</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Instructs
XMM to create Upper Memory Blocks
<P>
Default:  off<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> /NOUMB</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Instructs
XMM not to create Upper Memory Blocks
<P>
Default: /NOUMB
<P>
All other keywords are ignored. <!-- entering slot 214 --> Case is ignored.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These options affect all VDMs, but can be overridden by a VDM's configuration
strings.  The same option names are available to VDMs (without the prefixing
slash), except that XMMLIMIT only takes one numeric argument, corresponding
to the value i above.  The value g above cannot be changed once XMM is installed.

<P>
If a value of i=0 was specified on the DEVICE= line, to create a VDM with
XMS installed, specify a configuration string "XMMLIMIT" with a non-zero
value. Conversely, to have no XMS installed, specify a configuration string
"XMMLIMIT" with a value of zero.
<P>
If UMBs are being used, it is crucial that VXMS.SYS be the last device driver
loaded, for VXMS.SYS reserves all available addresses between 640KB and
1Meg for use as UMBs.  Hence, any device drivers which reserve pages in
that region (for example, VEMM) will not be able to install.
<P>
VXMS.SYS will fail to install if some other device driver has already reserved
the region from 1MB to 1MB+64KB.
<P>
The overall limit comprises the only relationship between XMS memory objects
in different VDMs, and is imposed to prevent XMS from acquiring all available
memory.  The default overall limit is 4MB, and the default limit for each
VDM is 1MB.  The default limit for each VDM can be overridden by installing
an application on the desktop and choosing to specify the XMS size with
the DOS Settings feature (see <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS Settings</A>).

<P>
Setting the overall limit to zero disables XMS in all VDMs regardless of
the per-VDM value.  Setting the default limit for a particular VDM to zero
disables XMS in all VDMs unless their start list entries specify a non-zero
XMS size.  Setting the XMS size to zero for an entry in the start list disables
XMS for that application's VDM only.  Novice users need never change the
default values.
<P>
In addition to memory sizes, the number of handles and the presence or absence
of Upper Memory Blocks are all configurable parameters which may be altered
on a per-VDM basis using the DOS Settings feature.
<P>
Upon installation, an initialization routine within VXMS.SYS supplies the
addresses of the VXMS.SYS VDM-creation and close routines to the Virtual
DOS Machine Manager.
<P>
<B>VDM Creation</B>
<P>
Upon creation of a VDM, a VDH service is used to get the maximum XMS size
for that VDM.  This will return a string if the program's entry on the desktop
has an associated VXMS size.  If the per-VDM size is not defined, the default
retrieved from CONFIG.SYS at initialization time will be used. If VXMS size
is not 0, the following steps are then performed:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) are found and reserved.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The High Memory Area (HMA) is reserved.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The real mode device driver stub is loaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The handle table and UMB list are initialized.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
To find an available linear region to use for UMBs, VXMS requests VDH services
to locate the largest free address range in the V86 mode address space above
640KB. VXMS reserves all the pages returned until the call fails.
<P>
VXMS requests the OS/2 Version 2.0 memory manager to allocate the 64KB region
immediately above 1MB for use as the High Memory Area.  The way in which
this is<!-- entering slot 215 --> accomplished depends upon a number of
variables; see <A HREF="193_L3_HighMemoryAreaHMA.html">High Memory Area
(HMA)</A> for further details.
<P>
Waiting until creation time to reserve this memory allows virtual device
drivers with actual hardware to claim their addresses first, since VXMS's
UMBs can be placed at any available address.  A consequence is that the
space is reserved only for the VDM being created; it could be in a different
location or be a different size for other VDMs.
<P>
VXMS then arranges for the loading of a stub device driver in the VDM. This
driver serves three purposes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The device driver header can be read by an application
searching for the name of the real mode VXMS driver.  It responds to all
device requests with "done" without actually doing anything.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The device driver's initialization code attaches VXMS
to interrupt vector 2Fh.  Attaching to vector 2Fh must be delayed until
after the virtual DOS environment has completed hooking all of its interrupts.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The device driver contains the VXMS<I> control function</I>;
calls to XMS services are not performed by calling a software interrupt,
but rather by calling a V86 mode<I> far</I> subroutine called the control
function. Moreover, XMS specifications require the control function to have
a particular physical layout.  Hence, the control function is placed in
a DOS device driver so that it may have the layout required by the specifications
and can transfer control to the virtual device driver code (the router function).
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The stub device driver is used to transfer control to the router function.
A DOS application invokes XMS functions by calling the control function
as a<I> far</I> procedure, the address of which can be obtained by a different
INT 2Fh call.  In response to such a request, the INT 2Fh interrupt handler
returns the address of the control function in the device driver stub.  The
Control Function then calls the protected mode VXMS entry point, and the
router obtains control.
<P>
The interrupt hook cannot be performed by the VXMS creation function, since
the  virtual DOS environment does not establish its interrupt hooks until
after all virtual device driver creation code has completed.  DOS device
driver initialization code is called after the interrupt vectors are set;
therefore delaying the hooking of vector 2Fh until DOS device driver initialization
time succeeds in hooking the vector.
<P>
<B>Routing</B>
<P>
The router receives control from the control function within the stub device
driver, as described above.  After checking that the XMS service request
is valid, the router calls the appropriate protected mode service routine,
which in turn requests the OS/2 Version 2.0 memory manager to allocate and
manipulate XMS objects.
<P>
Information calls involve at most a quick search of structures.  The number
of kilobytes VXMS reports as available is the minimum of the number of kilobytes
the VDM has left before it hits its per-VDM XMS memory usage limit, the
number of kilobytes all VDMs have left before hitting the system-wide memory
usage limit, and the amount the memory manager estimates is available.
