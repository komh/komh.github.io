<H1>DDE Concepts</H1><!-- entering slot 284 -->
<P>
DDE is a message protocol for dynamic data exchange between Windows programs.
Data may be shared among applications, the intention being to create an
integrated Windows environment.
<P>
<B>Client, Server and Conversation:</B>
<P>
Two applications participating in dynamic data exchange are said to be engaged
in a DDE<B> conversation</B>. The application which initiates the conversation
is the client application. The application which responds to the client
is the server application.  An application may be engaged in several conversations
at the same time, acting as a client in some conversations and as a server
in others.
<P>
A DDE conversation takes place between two windows, one for each of the
participating applications.  The window may be the main window of the application,
a secondary window associated with the application, or a hidden window.
A hidden window is typically used to process DDE messages.
<P>
DDE identifies the units of data passed between the client and server with
a three-level hierarchy of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Application name<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Topic<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Item.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each DDE conversation is uniquely identified by the application name and
topic. The<I> application name</I> is normally the name of the server application.
The<I> topic</I> is a general classification of data, within which multiple
data items may be exchanged during the conversation. The<I> item</I> is
the actual information related to the conversation topic that is exchanged
between the applications.  Values for the data item can be passed from the
server to the client, or from client to server. The format of the data item
may be any one of the clipboard formats (see <A HREF="244_L2_ClipboardSupport.html">Clipboard
Support</A>).
<P>
Once a DDE conversation has been initiated, the client may establish one
or more permanent data links with a server. A data link is a communication
mechanism by which the server notifies the client whenever the value of
a given data item changes.  The link is permanent in the sense that the
notification process continues until the data link or DDE conversation is
terminated.
<P>
The DDE link may be<B> warm</B> or<B> hot</B>. In a warm data link, the
server notifies the client that a value of a given data item has changed,
but the server does not actually send the data value to the client until
the client requests it. In a hot data link, the server immediately sends
the changed data value to the client.
<P>
Applications which support DDE typically provide a<I> Copy/Paste</I> command
in the<I> Edit</I> menu to allow the user to establish a DDE link.
