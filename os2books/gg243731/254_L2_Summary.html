<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides support for the execution of Windows applications
within the MVDM architecture.  This support allows the concurrent execution
of multiple Windows applications, using both real mode and standard mode,
with DPMI and Windows services provided as required by a Windows kernel.

<P>
Windows applications running under OS/2 Version 2.0 are provided with pre-emptive
multitasking by the operating system.  Full memory protection is also provided
for the Windows applications; an errant application may not affect other
applications executing in the system.  A bug in an application will cause
the termination of that application<I> only</I>.
<P>
Windows applications may be run under OS/2 Version 2.0 in three ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Each application may run in its own VDM.  This method
of execution provides full protection for the application from other processes
running in the system, and protects these other processes from errors in
the Windows application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Applications may share a VDM, and may be started and
controlled within this VDM using the Windows Program Manager.  This method
of execution provides protection for the Windows applications within the
VDM from other processes, and protection for other processes from errors
in the Windows VDM's applications.  However, the applications within the
VDM may affect one another since they share a common address space, just
as if they were running natively under DOS/Windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Windows applications may run "seamlessly" on the Workplace
Shell  desktop, along with windowed VDMs and Presentation Manager applications.
 This method of execution is similar to the case of a single application
in a VDM, except that the Windows application shares the Workplace Shell
desktop rather than running in its own full-screen session.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Any combination of these three methods may be used concurrently.
<P>
Windows applications may be defined on and started from the Workplace Shell
desktop.  Where a single application is defined for a VDM, or where the
application will run seamlessly, the icon used to represent the application
on the desktop is the icon embedded within the Windows program which runs
the application.
<P>
During installation of OS/2 Version 2.0 over an existing DOS/Windows 3.0
system, existing applications defined to the Windows Program Manager will
be detected and migrated where possible to the OS/2 Version 2.0 Workplace
Shell.  The installation procedure uses application definition information
contained in the Certified Application Database, which is shipped as part
of the OS/2 Version 2.0 product.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 allows communication between Windows applications running
in the same or different VDMs, and between Windows applications and Presentation
Manager applications.  This communication is provided through clipboard,
DDE and OLE support.  Communication between Windows applications using shared
memory is also supported, but only where Windows applications are executing
in the same VDM.
<P>
In summary, OS/2 Version 2.0 provides an integration platform which allows
Windows applications to coexist with one another and with DOS and OS/2 applications
in a multitasking, fully protected environment, and which allows these applications
to communicate with one another.
