<P>
Application installation methods vary widely in the DOS world. Some installations
involve nothing more than copying the software from diskette to the hard
disk. In more complex applications, the install procedure may check the
workstation configuration (both hardware and software), implement copy protection
and modify system files.
<P>
For most DOS applications, installation under OS/2 Version 2.0 is simply
a matter of starting a DOS full-screen or windowed session and following
the instructions supplied with the package as if the installation was taking
place on a DOS system. However, some may not work correctly because of the
special requirements of the installation program.
