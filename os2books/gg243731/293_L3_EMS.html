<P>
The following settings control the behavior of EMS memory used by the VDM.

<P>
<B>EMS_FRAME_LOCATION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> This DOS setting allows you to
change the location of the LIM EMS region. LIM EMS uses a 64KB address region
known as an EMS page frame, through which programs can access expanded memory.
(This allows programs to use more than 640KB of memory.)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>If a user has problems when running a program
that uses both a hardware device and LIM EMS expanded memory, the problem
may be due to conflicting use of addresses by LIM EMS and the hardware device.
If this occurs, the user should first use the<I> EMS_HIGH_OS_MAP_REGION
</I>setting to set the extra address region used by EMS to 0. This may solve
the problem. If the problem persists, the<I> EMS_FRAME_LOCATION</I> setting
can be used to select a 64KB region that does not conflict with hardware.

<P>
The user can choose where to place the frame from a list of choices or can
choose to have no EMS frame for programs which do not require a frame.  The
user can also reduce the<I> DOS Memory Size</I> setting and place the frame
below 640KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The
best solution, when problems due to hardware conflicts occur, is to use
the<I> MEM_EXCLUDE_REGIONS</I> and<I> MEM_INCLUDE_REGIONS</I> settings to
specify the addresses that the hardware uses rather than using this setting.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The default
AUTO setting will lead to correct choices of LIM EMS addresses.  Most users
will never need to change this setting.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>At VDM creation time only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>In some cases the default choice may conflict
with addresses used by hardware on the machine.  This can happen only for
devices that are not supported by a virtual device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>EMS_HIGH_OS_MAP_REGION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> In addition to the EMS page frame,
some programs can use additional addresses to access expanded memory.  This
setting gives advanced users the capability to adjust the size of the additional
EMS region.
<P>
See also EMS_FRAME_LOCATION above.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>An advanced user can use the<I> MEM_EXCLUDE_REGIONS
</I>and<I> MEM_INCLUDE_REGIONS</I> settings to specify the addresses used
by devices that do not have virtual device drivers, and can then set the
size of the<I> EMS_HIGH_OS_MAP_REGION</I> appropriately for their program.
This helps avoiding conflicts with addresses used by devices and programs.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The value
set is the size of the region in kilobytes.  The default is 32KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>At VDM creation only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>None.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>EMS_LOW_OS_MAP_REGION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Some programs can use remappable
conventional memory. Others do not use this feature.  This setting allows
advanced users to set the size of the remappable conventional memory available
in a VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The
value set is the size of the region in kilobytes.  The default is 384KB.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At VDM
creation only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> This setting controls the amount
of EMS memory available to a VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>The user can set this to a higher value for
running programs that require a large amount of EMS memory.  Other programs
do not use EMS at all.  The size can be set to 0 in such cases, to disable
EMS support for that VDM. Programs generally state whether they use EMS
on the box or in their manuals.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The
value set is the size of the region in kilobytes.  The default size is 2MB.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At VDM
creation time only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> If
a spreadsheet runs out of memory, the amount of EMS memory can be increased
and the VDM restarted.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
