<H1>Hardware Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 337 -->
<P>
The following settings affect the virtual hardware environment provided
by the virtual DOS machine.
<P>
<B>HW_NOSOUND</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Enables or disables sound started
by a DOS program.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantage:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Any
sound from a program is heard unless sound is disabled.  An "x" in the check
box indicates that the sound is to be heard.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>No error sound will be heard if HW_NOSOUND
is turned on.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> OFF.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time, including while a program is running in a VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Output from a music program may be disabled
when the user wishes to hear another music program, or switch to another
process to do something else.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>HW_ROM_TO_RAM</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Enabling HW_ROM_TO_RAM causes
the operating system to copy read-only memory (ROM) and run the copy in
32-bit random access memory (RAM).  With this setting enabled, BIOS operations
run faster and system utilities may patch BIOS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>OFF.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
VDM creation only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> This
setting is useful if debugging the kernel.  The change would allow normal
breakpoints to be set in ROM and allow stepping over calls and loops.
<P>
<B>Warning: </B> If an application writes to a memory address used by the
ROM while this setting is enabled, it may cause unpredictable results for
that application and for every application run thereafter in the VDM.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>HW_TIMER</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> When enabled, allows an application
to have direct access to the 8253 timer ports and prevents the operating
system from trapping, or intercepting, the timer request and emulating a
timer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Certain
timing-critical applications will not run (or will run much slower) if accesses
to timer ports are trapped and virtualized.  In addition, the values they
read do not accurately reflect the amount of time passed because they do
not take trapping overhead into account.  Enabling this setting allows certain
timing-dependent code to run more effectively.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Applications that change the divisor before
this setting is enabled and then read the timer ports after the setting
has been enabled may not function properly.  If the setting is enabled first,
the VDM will not detect changes to the divisor correctly, and the simulated
interrupt frequency will be incorrect.  Also, multiple applications using
this setting may interfere with one another.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Off.  Most applications will operate normally
with timer virtualization.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.  It is useful to alter this setting dynamically and watch for
changes in application performance.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>The ROMs on some machines implement very brief
delays by polling the timer ports.  These delays become unacceptably long
unless direct timer port access is allowed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
