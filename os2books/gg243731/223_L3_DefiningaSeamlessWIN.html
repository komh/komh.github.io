<H1>Defining a "Seamless" WIN-OS/2 VDM</H1><!-- entering slot 255 -->
<P>
In order to obtain the highest integration of the Windows V3.0 and Windows
V2.x application into the OS/2 V2.0 Workplace Shell, the following definitions
must be provided in order to have the application execute in seamless mode:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select the<I> Program</I> page of the program
object's<I> Settings</I> notebook.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Enter the Windows application name in the<I> Path
and Filename</I> field. A fully qualified path and filename is necessary.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select the<I> Session</I> page of the program
reference object's<I> Settings</I> notebook.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on the<I> WIN-OS/2 window</I> radio button.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->All DOS settings are selectable for Windows applications
via the<I> Windows Settings</I> page dialog; Windows settings are included
in the same list.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The<I> "WIN-OS/2 Window"</I> radio button indicates that the associated
Windows application program is to be initiated in a "seamless" Windows VDM.
 This is a single application VDM.  However, the WIN-OS/2 Program Manager
may be registered with the Workplace Shell as a "seamless" WIN-OS/2 program
object.  Once the Program Manager is up and running, the user may launch
any other Windows program from it.  Of course, this assumes that other Windows
programs were installed through the Program Manager, and that they all run
in the same WIN-OS/2 session.
<P>
A new parameter is added to the SYSTEM.INI file:               WOS2VDMApps=!clipwos2,!ddeagent
<BR>

<P>
The WIN-OS/2 Program Manager reads this line for "seamless" WIN-OS/2 VDM,
to determine which applications to pre-start.
<P>
Since "WIN-OS/2 Window" is the default Windows application setting, all
Windows program objects that are created through the Windows Migration utility
(for standard mode Windows applications) will default to that setting. If
a user chooses to execute a Windows application by double clicking its program
file's icon in the<I> Drives</I> folder, rather than its program object
icon (if any), then the Workplace Shell will attempt to initiate it in a
"seamless" Windows environment.
