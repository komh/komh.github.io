<P>
In order to provide the maximum level of hardware independence for the OS/2
Version 2.0 operating system, device driver are used to communicate with
hardware devices.  This concept is not new, and has been implemented in
previous versions of OS/2 and in the DOS operating system.  However, the
implementation of device drivers under OS/2 Version 2.0 differ in several
significant ways from that seen in previous versions.  This chapter describes
the implementation of device drivers under OS/2 Version 2.0.
