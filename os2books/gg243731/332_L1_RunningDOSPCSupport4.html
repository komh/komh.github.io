<H1>Running DOS PC Support/400 in OS/2 V2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 383 -->
<P>
This appendix covers the instructions for the installation of DOS PC Support/400under
OS/2 V2.0, and the restrictions for this environment.
<P>
In DOS PC Support/400, the Shared Folders device driver is a block device
driver. Since the virtual DOS machine of OS/2 V2.0 does not support block
device drivers, DOS PC Support/400 must be run in a Virtual Machine Boot
session. We will describe below the setup of DOS PC Support/400 in a DOS
5.0 Virtual Machine Boot. The process creates a DOS 5.0 boot diskette,  which
is then copied as a diskette image to the hard disk. This enables the DOS
PC Support/400 Virtual Machine Boot to be started from the hard disk rather
than a diskette.
