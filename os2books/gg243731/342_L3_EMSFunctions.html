<H1>EMS Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 393 -->
<P>
The following is a brief summary of LIM EMS Version 4.0 functions.  Note
that it is a summary of the EMS specification itself, and<I> not</I> of
its implementation under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
<B>Allocating/Reallocating/Deallocating Expanded Memory</B>
<P>
An allocation request can be made for a number of expanded memory pages
and, if successful, a handle is returned.  This handle is then used by the
application to reallocate or deallocate memory.
<P>
<B>Mapping Expanded Memory</B>
<P>
Logical pages in an object can be mapped into physical address ranges addressable
by the 8086 processor.  A mapping indicates the relation between EMS physical
pages and &lt;EMS Handle, EMS Logical Page&gt; pairs that the application
requires.  One example would be to map an expanded memory video buffer (EMS
logical pages) to the mappable window (EMS physical pages) to create a video
image in expanded memory.  An EMS service request can then be used to move
the image from expanded memory to screen memory.
<P>
A single logical page can be mapped to multiple physical pages. This is
used by programs such as Lotus 1-2-3. When a single logical page is mapped
to multiple physical pages, a write to any of these physical pages writes
to the same expanded memory.  An application can write to one address and
then read the results from another address.  This feature can be used to
provide independent mappings to a shared structure for multiple modules.
To implement this aliasing, multiple page registers must all point to the
same memory.  This leads to a requirement for the memory manager to support
aliasing of page table entries.
<P>
A physical page can be unmapped.  Reads/writes to unmapped memory do not
kill the application, but an application cannot depend on reading what it
has previously written.  LIM EMS specifies that a program must unmap mappable
windows before allowing another program to run, in order to protect the
memory mapped by the first program.
<P>
The specification does not stipulate what happens to programs that touch
unmapped memory, only that the physical pages are "inaccessible for reading
and writing".  One possible implementation is to map unmapped pages to nonexistent
physical pages (the Microsoft Windows/386 product does this). Another alternative
is to map them to physical ROM.  This can lead to problems, however, on
some machines that cache ROM.  The safest alternative is to use a single
physical page of memory.
<P>
<B>Information Calls</B>
<P>
An application may obtain information about the EMS resources available,
current mappings, and handle usage.  In a multiprogramming environment or
where TSRs are loaded, however, this information may be out of date by the
time it is used.  For instance, an application may determine the amount
of LIM memory available, but before getting the opportunity to request an
allocation, a TSR may request EMS memory.  The application would find less
memory available than expected.
<P>
<B>Saving/Restoring Mappings</B>
<P>
Several calls are available for an application to obtain data that can later
be returned to EMS to restore a mapping.  For some calls, this information
is saved internally by the EMS driver.  For others, it is returned to the
application.
<P>
One type of save operation automatically saves the registers pointing to
the first 64KB of the mappable window to an internal EMS buffer associated
wtih an EMS handle supplied by the user.  Typically, this is used by a TSR
to save and restore the current mappable window by<!-- entering slot 394 --> saving
to an EMS buffer associated with a handle owned by the TSR.  Other save
operations return either complete or partial information to the application,
which the application can later provide to restore memory mappings.  Still
other calls allow EMS the option to store register information on the application's
stack.  There are five different ways to save and restore registers in addition
to techniques for setting the registers.
<P>
<B>Alternate Register Sets</B>
<P>
This is an optional feature of EMS.  Mapping can be done to any of a number
of register sets.  The application can then switch the active register set.
The effect is similar to switching page tables under OS/2 Version 2.0.  Alternate
Register Sets can be protected by the first application to claim a protection
key.  Only the application with the key will be allowed to claim a register
set or switch the active one unless no one claims the key or the process
with the key permits others to use the alternate sets.
<P>
This feature is typically used by DOS extenders such as Microsoft Windows.
Switching memory during a task switch can be accomplished by turning on
permission for changing register sets using the permission key, switching
the current register set, and turning alternate set permission off.  Even
when alternate register sets are not supported, save and restore operations
for register set 0 are simulated with data passed to and from the application.

<P>
<B>DMA Register Sets</B>
<P>
This is an optional feature of EMS.  These register sets allow association
of a DMA channel with a register set.  All DMA on that channel is remapped
through the associated DMA register set allowing EMS remapping during DMA.
When this feature is not supported, remapping of register sets may be delayed
until DMA completes.
<P>
<B>Program Execution</B>
<P>
This function allows an application to execute a procedure or subroutine
which lies in an expanded memory area not currently mapped into the 8086
address space.  EMS will perform a remap to bring the procedure or routine
into the 8086 address space, and pass control to the specified entry point.
This may be accomplished in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->JUMP passes control to the specified entry point but
makes no provision for return.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->CALL passes control to the specified entry point and
after the application routine returns, sets up an address mapping that will
be in effect when control returns to the calling routine.  The return address
is that of the instruction following the INT 67h service request.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This function allows applications to store code in expanded memory.
<P>
<B>Data Movement</B>
<P>
Copy and exchange services provide data movement between any combination
of conventional or expanded memory.  The start of a region of expanded memory
is indicated by handle, logical page and offset.  The memory being affected
need not be currently mapped into the 8086 address space.  Overlapping copies
succeed without corrupting data, and a return code indicates overlap to
the application.  Exchange operations may not overlap.
<P>
This function allows applications to conveniently move portions of expanded
objects around in expanded memory, or move them to or from conventional
memory, without having to first remap the objects into the 8086 address
space.
<P>
<B>EMM Protection</B>
<P>
Limited protection is available.  The first application that requests a
key can turn enable or disable access to alternate and DMA register sets.
There is no protection for memory objects.  Any application can determine
all handles in use and perform any operations on them.  Within a single
EMS implementation, a badly behaved application can wreak havoc on any application
using EMS.
<P>
For example, one Windows application may<!-- entering slot 395 --> write
over the memory of any other.  This is consistent with the general lack
of protection in the DOS environment, where applications have free access
to the machine's physical memory.
<P>
<B>OS Support</B>
<P>
On power up, an EMM implementation which supplies mappable conventional
memory allocates all mappable conventional memory to handle 0 and maps it
in.  This is typically all memory above the memory on the system board up
to 640KB.  This occurs before the operating system starts up and allows
programs like Windows to remap conventional memory.  Programs that remap
conventional memory are required to reset the mapping before returning to
the operating system.  EMS does not enforce this, however.
