<H1>Changing Settings During Execution</H1><!-- entering slot 328 -->
<P>
MVDM inserts a<I> DOS Settings...</I> menu item on the system menu for all
VDMs. Selecting this menu item causes the DOS Settings dialog box to be
displayed, which in turn allows the user to modify settings for the VDM.
 For full screen VDMs, the user must switch to the Presentation Manager
Window List using the Ctrl+Esc key sequence, and display the context menu
for the VDM session by clicking mouse button 2 on the VDM's entry in the
Window List.  The<I> DOS Settings...</I> option is displayed in the context
menu.
<P>
Note that only those settings that have been registered as being modifiable
at run time may be altered in this way; other settings are not presented
in the dialog box.
