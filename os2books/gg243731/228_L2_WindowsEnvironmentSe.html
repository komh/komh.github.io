<P>
When Windows application support is selected during installation of OS/2
Version 2.0, a WIN.INI file is built.  The options for devices selected
for the OS/2 environment are included in this file.
<P>
Should the user migrate from a DOS/Windows 3.0 environment, the original
WIN.INI created by Windows will be left unchanged.  At installation time,
the Windows installation process will examine the original AUTOEXEC.BAT
file and search in all directories specified in the PATH statement in there
for the original Windows WIN.COM file.  If one exists, it will copy all
Windows *.INI files and all the Windows application *.INI files from that
same subdirectory into the \OS\MDOS\WINOS2 subdirectory.  It will then modify
these copies to adjust for the appropriate video, mouse, country and keyboard
settings.  This happens in accordance with the answers provided during the
initial OS/2 setup.
<P>

Initialization Files"</A>
<P>
The Windows group files (*.GRP) and other Windows application-specific *.INI
files are also copied.  The modified WIN.INI and PROGMAN.INI files will
have their path statements modified to point to the new locations of these
files.
<P>
Printer definitions for the Windows environment will also depend on the
OS/2 setup, rather than on any previously defined printer device driver.
 Of course, all path statements in these files will be modified to point
to the appropriate directories.
<P>
If a user installs OS/2 V2.0 over a previous version of OS/2 V2.0, the Windows
install process will look for the existence of \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\WINOS2.COM.
If found, it will perform the same migration process from that base environment.
If none of these files can be found, the Windows installation process will
start from scratch, in the same way that a first-time Windows 3.0 installation
would do it.
<P>
The following initialization files are created/modified:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->WIN.INI<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->PROGMAN.INI<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->CONTROL.INI<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->SYSTEM.INI.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The initialization and group files are required to restore a corrupted Windows
environment. Backups of these files should be taken prior to making any
changes to this environment.
<P>
These files and their contents are described in the following sections.
