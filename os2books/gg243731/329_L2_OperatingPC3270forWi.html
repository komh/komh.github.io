<H1>Operating PC/3270 for Windows under OS/2 V2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 380 -->
<P>
You should now have the PC/3270 for Windows Icon on the desktop and are
ready to start PC/3270. Just open the object and wait for the sessions to
start.
<P>
For some of the configurations you will get the Communications/3270 Manager
screen, and you will have to Start Communications. If you want, you can
go into Profile and set Start Automatically so that it will automatically
start the sessions subsequently.
<P>
You will see that you get the A, B, etc., sessions as well as a Communications/3270
Manager session. All of the Icons look the same, but they have different
titles. If you minimize them, they will go to the Minimized Window Viewer
folder.
