<H1>Virtual Printer Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 168 -->
<P>
The virtual line printer device driver VLPT.SYS supports access to three
virtual parallel port controller devices from DOS applications running in
virtual DOS machines.
<P>
VLPT hooks INT 17h and processes requests for INT 17h services itself, rather
than allowing these requests to be handled by CBIOS. INT 17h support includes
support for function 02h (Read Status).
<P>
VLPT does not support virtual hardware interrupts.  If a DOS application
attempts to enable interrupts (that is, it attempts to set control port
bit 4, "IRQ EN"), that I/O operation is ignored, and the application will
not receive interrupts from the parallel port hardware.
<P>
VLPT buffers the print data which is subsequently directed to the OS/2 spooler
using file system services provided by the Virtual DOS Machine Manager.
 The spooler may be configured for output on each printer device (LPTx)
that will be accessed by DOS applications from a VDM. <A HREF="030_L2_VirtualPrinterDevice.html">Figure
"Virtual Printer Device Driver Operation"</A> shows the various operations
performed by the virtual printer device driver.
<P>
If VLPTDD.SYS is the only virtual printer device driver installed, no INT
17 will be issued when printing is done on numbered I/O devices (for example,
LPT1, LPT2, etc.). However, if an application such as a TSR program must
catch all INT 17 interrupts, the LPTDD.SYS device driver must be installed
as well. You can find LPTDD.SYS in the subdirectory \os2\mdos.
<P>
When LPTDD.SYS is available, a request from the DOS file system issuing
INT 21 is converted by LPTDD.SYS into INT 17. INT 17 is then forwarded to
VLPT.SYS and from this point on the print request proceeds as described
above in <A HREF="030_L2_VirtualPrinterDevice.html">Figure "Virtual Printer
Device Driver Operation"</A>. Note, however, that installing LPTDD.SYS in
addition to VLPT.SYS will cause the printing from a VDM to slow down.
<P>
<B>Spooling</B>
<P>
In order to support spooled print output, the OS/2 spooler must be installed.
 A new IOCTL interface is defined in order to allow the spooler to identify
itself to the physical printer device driver.  The new IOCTL functions<I> Set
Spooler Status</I> and<I> Get Spooler Status</I> are called by the spooler
and the Virtual DOS Machine Manager.
<P>
The spooler invokes the<I> Set Spooler Status</I> function (Category 5,
Function 4Ch) at spooler monitor registration time to inform the physical
device driver that a particular port is actively configured as the output
device for a particular spool queue.  It also invokes this interface whenever
the user manipulates the spooler queue setup by invoking the Print Manager's
<I>Setup Printers/Change Printers</I> dialog.
<P>
The Virtual DOS Machine Manager invokes the<I> Get Spooler Status</I> function
(Category 5, Function 6Ch) during an implicit open of a print device whenever
VLPT processes the first print output (INT 17h) from a VDM.  This allows
the Virtual DOS Machine Manager to determine if the spooler is active so
that it can return the spool queue file handle to VLPT to continue printing.

<P>
<B>Print Screen</B>
<P>
VLPT also supports the<I> Print Screen</I> function by hooking INT 05h so
that it is notified before the CBIOS INT 05h handler.  The CBIOS INT O5h
handler invokes INT 17h functions, and the VLPT INT 17h emulation in turn
sends this data to a spool file, if the spooler is active.  When the CBIOS
INT 05h handler returns, VLPT also receives control so that it may close
the spool file.
<P>
<B>File Transfer</B>
<P>
To support DOS file transfer programs which use the parallel ports (such
as the IBM Data<!-- entering slot 169 --> Migration Facility), and which
typically program the parallel port controller directly, VLPT provides a
mode known as<B> direct I/O access</B>. In this mode, the physical printer
device driver grants temporary exclusive ownership of the parallel port
hardware to the VDM in which the application is running.  This mode allows
the application to have direct access to the parallel port's data, status
and control registers.
<P>
If the port is not currently active (printing) under control of the physical
printer device driver, the physical device driver will grant VLPT exclusive
access to the port, and continue to service incoming file system I/O requests.
 Any incoming monitor requests from the spooler are blocked until exclusive
access is released (no error or status monitor packets are sent to the monitor
chain).
<P>
If the physical printer device driver is actively processing a hardware
I/O operation, when VLPT makes a request for exclusive access, the physical
device driver will return an error code to VLPT.  VLPT will then display
a pop-up message (via the<B> VDHPopUp()</B> helper service), allowing the
user to select the most appropriate system action ("End program" or "Retry").

<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Due to the multitasking nature of OS/2 V2.0, data communications
using this type of application have an increased probability of error when
multiple processes are concurrently active and/or when the virtual DOS machine
is switched to the background.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
<B>PS/2 Register Virtualization</B>
<P>
On PS/2 systems, the physical printer device driver ensures that all LPT
ports which support extended mode (read/write 8-bit parallel I/O) will be
enabled for extended mode at system initialization time.  On any PS/2 models
which do not enable this mode by default, the physical printer device driver
enables extended mode via the system's Programmable Option Select (POS)
function.  This ensures that all PS/2 LPT ports will support manipulation
of the control port<I> Direction Control</I> bit.
<P>
On all PS/2 models (but<I> not</I> on IBM PC/AT systems), VLPT will virtualize
the adapter enable/setup register.  All bits of this register are virtualized
for read operations, but<I> only bit 7 of the enable/setup register is virtualized
for write operations</I>.  DOS applications may modify bit 7 of this register
in order to gain access to the system board's POS Register 2, thereby enabling
or disabling extended mode operation of the parallel ports.  When bit 7
is set to 0 (the default state), the parallel port is configured as an 8-bit,
parallel, bidirectional interface.  When bit 7 is set to 1, the parallel
port bidirectional mode is disabled.  As described above, the physical printer
device driver ensures that all PS/2 models have this bit set to 0 (extended
mode enabled) during system initialization.
<P>
Note that only bit 7 is virtualized and may be manipulated; attempting to
manipulate any other bits of this register will result in termination of
the VDM.  As the behavior is virtualized, the true state of the hardware
register is not affected by any operations of a DOS application running
in a virtual DOS machine.
<P>
<B>Printer Close</B>
<P>
VLPT exports the<B> VDHPrintClose()</B> service. This interface may be called
by another virtual device driver such as VKBD to force any open printers
in a VDM to close.  This technique is used to handle a forced End-of-Job
(Ctrl+Alt+PrintScreen) character, and is required because some DOS applications
do not explicitly close or disable the printer when their print activity
is completed.
<P>
VLPT may also close open print<!-- entering slot 170 --> files whenever
a VDM is terminated.  VLPT registers an event hook with the Virtual DOS
Machine Manager, and is therefore notified upon termination of a VDM.  All
open print files in the terminating VDM are closed, after any buffered data
has been sent to the spooler.
<P>
When operating in direct I/O access mode, VLPT can detect application termination
in one of three ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->PDB is changed or destroyed (default)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->VDM is terminated<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->User hot-key (Ctrl+Alt+PrintScreen).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When this termination event is detected, direct I/O access mode is cancelled
and VLPT relinquishes the VDM's exclusive control of the parallel port hardware.
 The physical printer device driver then reclaims ownership of the port
and resumes normal I/O operations.
<P>
Note that VLPT will not always close an open print file when the DOS application
terminates.  Depending on the DOS application's behavior, the VDM may remain
active when the program ends, and the spooler print file may therefore remain
open.  If so, the user can cause the open print file(s) to close by using
the Ctrl-Alt-PrintScreen control key sequence. Alternatively, the user can
leave it to the system by setting the<I> PRINT_TIMEOUT</I> value in the
<I>DOS settings</I> to the time in seconds that the operating system should
wait before forcing the print job to the printer. Consequently there is
no need to exit these DOS programs to have the print job released from the
print spooler. For more information on PRINT_TIMEOUT see <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS
Settings</A>.
