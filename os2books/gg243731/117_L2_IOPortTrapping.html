<H1>I/O Port Trapping</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
A DOS application running in a VDM may access I/O ports directly using the
normal 8086 I/O instructions (such as, IN and OUT).  These instructions
are not considered IOPL-sensitive and do not normally generate a general
protection exception;  the operating system checks the I/O privilege map
in the VDM's task state segment to determine whether to allow the instruction
to execute or to generate a general protection exception.  This allows DOS
applications to access hardware devices using the normal DOS device drivers
from within a VDM.
<P>
When access to a device must be shared with other applications, however,
a virtual device driver is required, and the VDM may not directly access
the I/O port. At initialization time, the virtual device driver issues a
call to the<B> VDHSetIOHookState()</B> device helper function, which sets
the appropriate bit in the I/O privilege map.
<P>
When a DOS application subsequently issues an instruction for the I/O port:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A general protection exception is generated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The operating system's exception handler routes
the exception to 8086 Emulation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->8086 emulation then invokes the virtual device
driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
