<P>
Upon installation, the WIN.INI file is updated with the appropriate information
for the following options.  Installation will install the following Windows
device drivers in the appropriate directories:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Keyboard<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Mouse<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Video<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Printer<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Codepage/country.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If a device driver is supported in Windows but<I> not</I> supported by OS/2,
the Windows version will not be supported.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Any "illegal" combination of OS/2 and Windows display device
drivers may cause the Windows environment to crash or not to come up at
all.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
On the other hand, the user can configure a useful dual screen configuration,
which will actually run the Workplace Shell on one screen and Windows on
the other simultaneously.  OS/2 V2.0 may be run with the standard system
display, such as VGA, XGA and so on, and in addition, another display adapter
may be installed to run Windows applications, such as the IBM PS/2 Image
Adapter/A, which is a Micro Channel card and supported on PS/2s. This requires
the appropriate Windows display device driver to run exclusively on that
adapter and the screen connected to it.  Of course, the user must change
several things (examples shown relate to the Image Adapter/A):<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>CONFIG.SYS</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> Add "DEVICE=C:\MYSUB\IADOSRFS.SYS"

<P>
This may be done via the DOS Settings for that particular Windows session
object under the Workplace Shell.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> SYSTEM.INI
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL>Change "display.drv=IAA.DRV"<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> IASETUP.EXE
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL>This is a DOS program which needs to be run
once after installation.  This utility will actually add some special entries
to the WIN.INI file, which will tell the<I> IAA.DRV</I> display device driver
what resolution and color setup to use on the Image Adapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These device drivers and programs can be found on the Image Adapter support
diskette.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Do not confuse the scenario above with OS/2's standard dual
screen support, which is installed and configured automatically if a VGA
<I>and</I> 8514 (or XGA) are found during initial installation.  In that
case, only one screen will be active at any given moment, while the display
of the other will be frozen.
