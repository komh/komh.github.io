<H1>A Couple of Warnings and Suggestions</H1><!-- entering slot 381 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you have an XGA or 8514/A display adapter, be sure
that you had selected VGA mode for WIN-OS/2 during OS/2 installation. This
is mandatory for PC/3270 for Windows to run in a "seamless" WIN-OS/2 VDM.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Remember that the adapter is in use EXCLUSIVELY by
PC/3270. This is true for all of the adapters (DFT, SDLC, LAN).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you included the RESETOKN.SYS mentioned earlier
then you can shutdown and restart PC/3270 Token-Ring connections. This package
also comes with a RESETOKN.EXE file that can be used to close the adapter
so other applications can use it, if desired. You would have to invoke this
after shutting down PC/3270 or it will become very upset!<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you get message PCS232 - PCS802.SYS Module not
found, you probably set up the DOS_DEVICE statements incorrectly, or forgot
to install the LSP code.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you get message PCS234 - The Current Configuration
File Does Not Include Valid TSR Information; when you click on the CM/3370
Manager Start Communication Icon, then you either forgot to update the DOS_SHELL
option, or have a bad PC3270WO.BAT. The problem is that the PC3270W.BAT
does exist, but was not executed (loads the TSRs).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you get message PCS212 - PC/3270 is installed incorrectly,
you probably installed PC/3270 under Windows 3.0 running in enhanced mode.
You will need to reinstall PC/3270.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you open the new PC/3270 object and it closes after
a few seconds, then you probably have the DOS_SHELL or the PC3270 Batch
file PC3270WO.BAT set up incorrectly.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If you open the PC/3270 object a second time, and
it just sits there or hangs the machine, you might not have set Separate
Session set on or you did not include the RESETOKN.SYS driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Sometimes OS/2 does not know when a Windows application
closes. Therefore when you do a shutdown, the desktop thinks that the application
is still running. When you start OS/2 the next time, it will automatically
start the application again.
<P>
There is a way around this:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Bring up the OS/2 Window List (Ctrl-Esc).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Select the line that says WIN-OS/2 and has PC/3270
listed under it.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Click the right mouse button.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Select Close, this will close all the applications,
and the WIN-OS/2 environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> A side effect is that
all Windows Applications that OS/2 thinks are still open will be officially
closed. The applications will no longer have hash marks over their icons.
You can now Shutdown gracefully.
<P>
You can circumvent this effect by running Personal Communications/3270 for
Windows a<I> separate WIN-OS/2</I> session.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
