<H1>Customizing the VDM Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 318 -->
<P>
The OS/2 Version 2.0 virtual DOS machine environment may be extensively
customized to suit the requirements of a particular DOS application.  Such
properties as DOS device drivers, EMS/XMS memory configurations, and even
the interface to hardware facilities can be specified individually for each
VDM.
<P>
This customization is achieved using the DOS Settings facility, which is
accessed by pressing the<I> DOS settings</I> pushbutton on the<I> Session
</I> page of the<I> settings</I> notebook.
<P>
The DOS Settings facility and the available settings are described in detail
in <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS Settings</A>.
