<H1>Virtual Mouse Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 182 -->
<P>
Given the diversity of mouse hardware, and the complexity of dealing with
all possible combinations of mouse hardware and video equipment, few if
any applications talk directly to mouse hardware.  Most applications which
support a mouse do so through the INT 33h interface.  Virtualization of
the INT 33h interface is provided by the virtual mouse device driver VMOUSE.SYS.

<P>
The INT 33h interface performs the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Position and button tracking<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Position and button event notification<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Selectable pixel and mickey mappings<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Video mode tracking<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Video pointer management (location and appearance)
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The interface between the physical mouse driver and VMOUSE is straightforward.
 The physical mouse driver is aware at all times of which session owns the
mouse; thus, when a foreground VDM owns the mouse, it notifies VMOUSE of
mouse events.  The events themselves remain buffered by the physical device
driver until VMOUSE requests them.  Normally, VMOUSE asks for each event
immediately, and updates the INT 33h data structures for the foreground
VDM, unless the application running in the VDM has registered a mouse event
subroutine.
<P>
If a mouse event subroutine has been registered by the application, VMOUSE
may have to notify the routine of a mouse event.  This depends on the events
for which the subroutine has requested notification.  When a registered
subroutine must be called, VMOUSE requests a fake interrupt to be simulated
into the VDM.  A fake interrupt service routine (loaded into each VDM upon
creation) immediately emulates the interrupt and then proceeds to notify
the VDM's registered subroutine.  In order to pick an IRQ that is guaranteed
to not conflict with any other virtual device driver, VMOUSE queries the
physical mouse driver at initialization time for the physical IRQ used by
the mouse.  This ensures that no conflict occurs.
<P>
<B>Position and Button Data Tracking</B>
<P>
Position and button events are interrupt time events that are communicated
to VMOUSE by the physical device driver via a "data ready" entry point.
 If the VDM is not already processing a previous event, VMOUSE calls the
physical device driver to get the new event; otherwise, VMOUSE waits until
previous event processing is complete.  This avoids the need for buffering
within VMOUSE.
<P>
Normally, the VDM will not be processing any events, so position and button
information can be immediately retrieved and stored for later query by a
VDM application, via INT 33h.
<P>
<B>Position and Button Event Notification</B>
<P>
As events are requested and supplied by the physical mouse driver, VMOUSE
peeks ahead to the next event (if any) and, if it is a movement-only event,
extracts it and overlays the current event.  This is continued until there
are no more events, or the next event is not a movement-only event.  This
reduces the amount of interrupt-simulation overhead during periods of rapid
mouse movement.
<P>
<B>Selectable Pixel-to-Coordinate and Mickey-to-Pixel Mappings</B>
<P>
Since pixel-to-virtual-coordinate mappings are often used by DOS applications
but are not supported for protected mode applications;  VMOUSE manages such
mappings.  Since mickey-to-pixel mappings<I> are</I> supported for protected
mode, VMOUSE relies on the physical mouse driver to perform these mappings.
 Thus physical mouse driver interfaces are provided to set the mickey-to-pixel
mapping and the dimensions of the screen in pixels.
