<P>
The DOS Emulation kernel which is normally used to support the execution
of DOS applications in a VDM is exactly what its name implies; an emulation
of the DOS operating system and associated services.  While this suffices
for most DOS applications, certain applications exist which take advantage
of unique and/or undocumented features which exist only in specific versions
of DOS.
<P>
To allow such applications to be successfully run under OS/2 Version 2.0,
the VMB (Virtual Machine Boot) feature is provided.  This feature allows
a "real" DOS operating system, or indeed most other 8086 operating systems,
to be booted in a virtual DOS machine.  The operating system may be booted
from either a diskette in drive A:, a diskette image on a hard disk, or
a partition on a hard disk.
<P>
Applications which run using Virtual Machine Boot may take advantage of
the EMS, XMS and mouse support provided to virtual DOS machines by OS/2
Version 2.0.  This support is provided through stub device drivers supplied
with OS/2 Version 2.0; these should be used in preference to the device
drivers supplied with the operating system or applications.
