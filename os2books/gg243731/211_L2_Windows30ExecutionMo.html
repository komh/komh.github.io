<H1>Windows 3.0 Execution Modes</H1><!-- entering slot 237 -->
<P>
The native Windows 3.0 environment has three execution modes, though the
options available to any user depend upon the machine's processor and the
amount of installed memory. These modes are important, as they are relevant,
to the discussion later of the way in which OS/2 runs Windows applications.
The initial description of each mode comes from the<I> Microsoft Windows
User's Guide</I>.
