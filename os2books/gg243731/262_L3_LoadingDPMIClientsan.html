<H1>Loading DPMI Clients and Extended Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 300 -->
<P>
All DPMI applications begin execution in real mode.  An application must
run first as a real mode DOS program, but can then switch to protected mode
by making a call to DPMI (or to a DOS extender).  Once in protected mode,
all INT 31h calls supported by DPMI may be issued by the application or
its associated DOS extender functions.
<P>
A DOS extender and its application under DPMI are loaded and initialized
as described below.  The DOS extender:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Loads in real mode (or V86 mode on an 80386/80486
machine).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Checks for presence of a DPMI server.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Switches the CPU from real mode to protected
mode, and loads registers with the appropriate selectors.
<P>
If no DPMI server is present, the DOS extender checks for the existence
of a VCPI server or XMS device driver before assuming total control of the
CPU's execution mode, privileged control registers, and memory management
hardware.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Uses DPMI services to build the protected mode
environment to be used by the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Allocates extended memory segments to hold the
application's code, data, and stacks.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Allocates selectors to be used by the application
to execute in and/or address the memory segments.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Reads the application's code and data from disk
into the segments.
<P>
The DOS extender can mark pageable memory it uses below 640KB so as to reduce
the demand for physical memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Installs its own handlers for any software interrupts
(such as DOS INT 21h) that the application will execute.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Control is then passed to the application.
