Just as EMS object handles use logical pages indexed from 0, EMS Physical
Segments are also numbered from 0.  A particular address that can have expanded
memory mapped into it can be referred to either by the address of a physical
segment or by a physical page number.  These are two alternate ways to refer
to the same location in the 8086 addressable space.  By convention, physical
page 0 is the beginning of the mappable window and succeeding physical pages
occupy contiguous pages in the window.  Mappable physical pages in conventional
memory (&lt;640KB) follow the mappable window in this numbering scheme.
 Note that in EMS terminology a "physical page" does<I> not</I> mean physical
memory; it is a way to refer to a particular address below 1MB.
