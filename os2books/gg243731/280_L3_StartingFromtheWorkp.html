<H1>Starting From the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 321 -->
<P>
In order for an application to be started from within the Workplace Shell,
it must first be defined and configured as described in <A HREF="274_L2_DefiningaDOSApplicat.html">Defining
a DOS Application</A>. Once this has been done, the application may be started
simply by double-clicking mouse button 1 on the application's icon on the
desktop or in a folder.
<P>
Note that when the application is started, the background of the icon will
change to indicate that the application is in use. By default, if the user
double-clicks mouse button 1 on the icon a second time, the operating system
will<I> not</I> start a second instance of the application, but will simply
bring the already started instance to the foreground.
<P>
If the user wishes to create a second instance of the application, a second
representative object can be created by copying the original instance. Alternatively,
the user can change the default behavior in the<I> Window</I> page of the
<I>settings</I> notebook.
