<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides clipboard support between Windows applications,
in the same or separate VDMs, as well as support between Windows applications
and <A HREF="488_L0_.html">OS/2 Presentation Manager</A> applications.  The
clipboard serves as a data-exchange feature acting as a common area to store
data handles through which applications exchange formatted data. The same
data may be represented in a number of different formats as specified by
the application. Note that objects in the clipboard may be of any size and
format.
<P>
The combined OS/2 and Windows clipboard environment under OS/2 Version 2.0
is shown in <A HREF="051_L2_OS2Version20Clipboar.html">Figure "OS/2 Version
2.0 Clipboard Environment"</A>.
<P>
Data is formatted in either a predefined or private format, before being
copied to the clipboard. In most cases the data is copied to pre-allocated
global memory and a function call is used to copy the memory handle to the
clipboard.  Windows provides a number of predefined data formats:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>TEXT</B><!-- lm: 0x12 12 -->
<UL> Null-terminated text<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> OEMTEXT
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 12 -->
<UL>Null-terminated text using an OEM character
set<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> PICTURE</B><!-- lm: 0x12 12 -->
<UL> Metafile

</UL><B> TIFF</B><!-- lm: 0x12 12 -->
<UL> Tag

</UL><B> Any Private Format</B><!-- lm: 0x12 12 -->
<UL> Will
be kept in the same format.  This will be usable only by applications which
<I>know</I> about this private format.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These formats will be recognized and exported/imported by the global clipboard
server.
<P>
Data formats which are not supported by the clipboard server, cannot be
transferred.  Such formats can only be handled by the<I> local</I> clipboards.
This means that such formats may only be used to exchange data between Presentation
Manager applications, or between Windows applications running in the same
VDM. In addition, some of the data formats will also be converted, because
of several differences between Windows and Presentation Manager data structures.
 This is further discussed in <A HREF="245_L3_WINOS2ClipboardSuppo.html">WIN-OS/2
Clipboard Support (Scenario 3 - Cut/Paste Between OS/2 And WIN-OS/2)</A>.

<P>
The<I> OwnerDraw</I> feature in the Windows clipboard is only supported
within a MAVDM, as shared memory is required. OwnerDraw is a process whereby
a Windows application takes control over the appearance of menu items and
has responsibility for managing these menu items.
<P>
The native Microsoft Windows 3.0 clipboard provides support for both Windows
applications and non-Windows applications. Non-Windows applications (that
is, "native" DOS applications) run in either full-screen or "windowed" mode.
 This kind of environment is not supported in a MAVDM, because it is supported
by the Workplace Shell  directly.  Therefore, clipboard support for native
DOS applications is provided through Presentation Manager.
<P>
Should the user wish to capture the contents of a VDM running in full-screen
mode, the following approach is adopted:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Switch to the Presentation Manager screen containing
the VDM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select the System menu on the VDM icon<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select<I> Copy All</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
This procedure will copy the VDM's video buffer to the Presentation Manager
 clipboard (either in ASCII format or as a Presentation Manager bitmap).

<P>
Selective copy is available in windowed mode.  When a VDM is running in
a window, the user may mark a specific rectangular area which will then
be copied into the clipboard.
<P>
This level of clipboard data exchange is fully supported by the VDM itself.
The Windows kernel is not involved at all.
