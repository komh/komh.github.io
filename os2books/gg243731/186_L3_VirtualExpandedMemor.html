<H1>Virtual Expanded Memory Manager</H1><!-- entering slot 201 -->
<P>
EMS services are implemented under MVDM using a virtual device driver known
as the <A HREF="468_L2_VirtualExpandedMemor.html"><B>Virtual Expanded Memory
Manager</B> (<B>VEMM</B>)</A>, which offers a separate EMS emulation to
each VDM. This implementation is accomplished by placing most VEMM control
structures in a per-VDM data area outside the V86 mode address space. Each
VDM has up to 255 handles, 15 alternate register sets, remappable conventional
memory for operating system use, and a 16KB "raw" block size.
<P>
VEMM prehooks interrupt vector 67h through a VDH service to catch software
interrupts for EMS services.  Prehooking means that VEMM gains control before
the V86 mode interrupt vector is called. VEMM also provides a V86 mode stub
driver used to indicate to DOS applications that EMS is available. This
stub must hook INT 67h so that applications can find a particular string
in the header to determine if EMS is available. When, as in the typical
case, applications have not also hooked INT 67h, VEMM handles service requests
at prehook time. When INT 67 has been hooked, VEMM handles requests when
the stub's hook calls it by doing an INT 67h from inside the stub.
<P>
To prevent VDM's from grabbing large amounts of EMS memory, there is a configurable
default per VDM limit.  VEMM depends heavily upon the memory manager. EMS
object allocation, reallocation, or deallocation is accomplished by requesting
corresponding services from VDH services. Most VEMM creation time setup
is postponed until the first INT 67h service request is made. <A HREF="033_L2_ExpandedMemoryManage.html">Figure
"Expanded Memory Manager Control Flow"</A> shows the flow of control when
a DOS application makes an EMS service request from within a VDM:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->INT 67h service requests are trapped by the Virtual
DOS Machine Manager and routed to VEMM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The VEMM makes the appropriate requests to VDH
services to allocate or manipulate the EMS object.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Expanded Memory Manager Control Flow</B>
<P>
During the initialization of the VDM the VDM Manager loads and initializes
the EMS DOS stub device driver into the VDM address space.
<P>
The VDM Application can use either of two methods to test for the existence
of the VEMM:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Issue an open request (INT 21h Function 3DH)
using the guaranteed device name of the VEMM driver. If the open function
succeeds, either the driver is present or a file with the same name coincidentally
exists on the default disk drive. To rule out the latter, the application
can use IOCTL(INT 21h Function 44H) subfunctions 00h and 07h to ensure that
VEMM is present. Don't forget to use INT 21H Function 3Eh to close the handle
that was obtained from the open function, so that the handle can be reused
for another file or device.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Look for a special signature in the EMS DOS stub
device driver which signals the VDM Application that EMS is available. This
search is done by using the address that is found in the INT 67h vector
to inspect the device header of the presumed VEMM which is, in this case,
the fooling EMS DOS stub device driver. Interrupt handlers and device drivers
<B>must</B> use this method. If the VEMM seems to be present, the name field
at a special offset of the device header contains a special string. This
method is not only<!-- entering slot 202 --> avoiding the relatively high
overhead of an VDM DOS open function but is nearly foolproof. However, it
is somewhat less well behaved because it involves inspection of memory that
does not belong to the application.
<P>
The only task of the EMS DOS stub device driver is to tell the VDM DOS application
that EMS is available. As soon as this is done the regular EMS business
can start as explained in the following points:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The VDM Application issues a INT 67h service
request.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
7.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>The result is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
This constellation also allows a VDM application to hook INT 67h.
<P>
Note that unlike most virtual device drivers, VEMM does not have a corresponding
physical device driver.  Instead, VEMM manages its memory using the OS/2
Version 2.0 operating system kernel's memory management services. EMS object
allocation, reallocation, or deallocation is accomplished by requesting
corresponding services from the operating system's memory manager.  For
example, when an application requests the allocation of an expanded memory
object, VEMM asks the memory manager to allocate a memory object in linear
memory outside any VDM.
<P>
<B>Structure</B>
<P>
The VEMM module consists of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->An<I> Initialization Component</I> that determines
the default size at boot time<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<I> Creation Component</I> that initializes per-VDM
structures when a VDM is created<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A<I> Router</I> that decodes application INT 67h (and
routes the call to a service routine) and 30 service routines with associated
sub-services.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
Each VDM has a 255-entry EMS handle table used to keep track of the size
and allocation of expanded memory objects, 16 register sets that indicate
which parts of the expanded objects are mapped into the VDM address space,
and save tables to save register set contents.  Only one register set is
active at a time.  That active register set indicates the actual page table
contents.  Switching register sets or restoring a saved register set resets
all aliases in the windows to those indicated by the new register set.  Unmapped
pages are set to "black hole" memory.  The memory manager's page size for
all these operations is 4KB.  VEMM makes the adjustment for its 16KB page
size.
<P>
<B>Initialization</B>
<P>
VEMM is typically installed at system initialization time, via a DEVICE=
statement in CONFIG.SYS, as shown below:
<PRE>DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VEMM.SYS 4096, 2048
</PRE>

<P>
<!-- entering slot 203 -->To prevent VDMs from using all available memory,
there is an overall limit on the amount of EMS memory, and a default limit
for each VDM to prevent a VDM from requesting all available EMS memory.
 The defaults for these limits are specified in the DEVICE= statement for
VEMM.  The default limit for each VDM may be overridden using the DOS Settings
feature.
<P>
Setting the overall limit to zero disables EMS in all VDMs, regardless of
the per-VDM value.  Setting the per-VDM value to zero disables EMS in all
VDMs unless their entries on the Presentation Manager desktop specify a
non-zero EMS size.  Setting the EMS size to zero for an entry on the desktop
disables EMS for that application only.  Most users need never change the
default value.  DOS settings for frame position, and the size of extra mapping
regions above and below 640KB may be configured by the user; see <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS
Settings</A>.
<P>
Upon installation, an initialization routine within VEMM supplies the entry
point addresses of VEMM creation and close routines to the Virtual DOS Machine
Manager.
<P>
Most VEMM setup is postponed until the first INT 67H service request is
made.  Only remappable conventional memory is set up before that time. This
assures that other virtual device drivers have a chance to reserve ROM and
device memory areas.
<P>
<B>VDM Creation</B>
<P>
Upon creation of a VDM, a VDH service is used to get the EMS size for that
VDM.  This will return a string if the DOS program's entry on the desktop
has an associated EMS size.  If not defined, the default size retrieved
from CONFIG.SYS at system initialization is used.  If EMS size is not zero,
the following steps are then performed:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Two mappable windows are located and reserved.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Memory is mapped into the low window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Interrupt 67h is hooked using a VDH service.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The V86 mode device driver stub is loaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->An initial block of the handle table is allocated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Upon VDM creation, VEMM allocates a block of memory in the area between
256KB and RMSIZE [The RMSIZE statement in CONFIG.SYS specifies the maximum
size of a VDM's address space; values up to 640KB are allowed. ] and maps
it into the VDM address space.  VEMM requests VDH services to locate the
largest free address range in the V86 mode address space above 640KB that
is available for the mappable window.  VEMM then reserves the largest range
available that is at least 64KB and no more than 128KB in size, and is a
multiple of 16KB.  If an extended BIOS data area is present, the returned
free range will be below this area so that BIOS cannot be inadvertently
mapped away.
<P>
Waiting until creation time to reserve this memory allows virtual device
drivers with actual hardware to claim their addresses first, since VEMM
can place its memory at any available address.  A consequence of this technique
is that the space is reserved only for the VDM being created. It could be
in a different location or be a different size for other VDMs.
<P>
VEMM performs mapping by requesting the operating system's memory manager
to alias linear space<!-- entering slot 204 --> inside a mappable window
in the V86 mode address space to a memory region outside the V86 address
space.  The application can then access this part of the expanded memory
object.
<P>
The VEMM virtual device driver prehooks interrupt vector 67h through a VDH
service to catch software interrupts for EMS services.  Prehooking means
that VEMM gains control before the V86 mode interrupt vector is called.
VEMM also provides a stub driver, the sole function of which is to indicate
to DOS applications that EMS is available.
<P>
VEMM then arranges for the loading of a stub device driver in the VDM. This
driver provides a header within the V86 mode address space which can be
read by an application searching for the name of the real mode EMS driver.
 It also responds to a few simple requests made to its strategy routine,
basically replying that it is present and ready.  The stub driver does not
actually process EMS service requests; these are handled by VEMM.
<P>
<B>Routing</B>
<P>
The router receives notification from the Virtual DOS Machine Manager when
an application issues an INT 67h request.  The router checks the request
to ensure that it is valid, and then causes an exception which is routed
to the Virtual DOS Machine Manager.  The Virtual DOS Machine Manager then
reflects the interrupt back into the VDM's interrupt vector table.  This
technique is necessary since interrupt vector hooks are only allowed after
application code has been executed.  The V86 mode interrupt vector for INT
67h causes another exception which is routed to the Virtual DOS Machine
Manager which then calls VEMM.
<P>
The EMS<I> Alter Map and Call</I> service allows an application to have
VEMM remap memory to place a routine within the V86 mode address space,
call that routine and then remap memory to its previous state again after
the routine issues a<I> far return</I>.  This call can occur recursively;
the application code that is called can in turn use the<I> Alter Map and
Call</I> service.
<P>
VEMM does the initial remapping and stores the after-call remapping information
on the client's stack.  VDH services are used to call the application's
routine and intercept the return.  VEMM supplies the Virtual DOS Machine
Manager with a V86 mode address to call and a VEMM handler which is invoked
when the application routine does a<I> far return</I>.  After the routine
returns, VEMM restores the original mapping saved on the client's stack.

<P>
The<I> Remap and Jump</I> service is similar but does not require interception
of an application routine's return or the saving of a mapping.  Remapping
is done and the CS:IP is changed to jump to the address provided by the
application.
<P>
Information calls involve at most a quick search of structures.  Structures
are maintained to provide information about handles, allocations, and VEMM
capabilities.  Handle directory services are also provided.  The number
of pages VEMM reports as available is the minimum of the number of pages
the VDM has left in VEMM pages and the amount the memory manager estimates
is available.
<P>
<B>Protection</B>
<P>
A pseudo-random key is produced with the first protection call made by a
VDM and also for the first protection call made after a key was returned.
This key is given to the application which made the call that caused its
generation.  OSEnabled can be reset only by the owner of the key.  The key
owner can also return the key.  OSEnabled indicates whether or not protected
functions can be executed.  The key will be generated by operations on the
current time to ensure that the key changes, even for multiple calls between
successive timer ticks.
