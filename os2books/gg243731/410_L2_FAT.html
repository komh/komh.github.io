File Allocation Table; term used to describe the file system implemented
by DOS and also supported by OS/2.  This file system uses a file allocation
table to contain the physical sector addresses of all files on the disk.
 The FAT file system is supported by OS/2 Version 2.0, along with the newer
HPFS and other installable file systems.
