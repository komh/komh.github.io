<H1>Problems with Extended Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 222 -->
<P>
If an application in a VDM encounters an error due to insufficient extended
memory, the following points should be checked:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure the overall limit and the limit for the VDM
are large enough to accommodate the amount of extended memory required by
the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure that the DEVICE= statement for VMXS.SYS is
in CONFIG.SYS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure that the expanded memory driver VEMM.SYS, is
not using all of the available memory.  The amount of memory allocated to
VEMM may be reduced by changing the parameters of the DEVICE= statement
for VEMM to something less than that specified (or less than the default
which is 4MB).  If necessary, VEMM command may be disabled by removing or
remarking out the DEVICE= statement in CONFIG.SYS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure that CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT do not
start unnecessary programs that use extended memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If a program does not start and displays a message such as<I> High Memory
Area (HMA) already in use</I>, the HMA may be freed by disabling the DOS=HIGH
statement in CONFIG.SYS.  If the statement is DOS=HIGH, UMB then the statement
should be changed to DOS=UMB.
