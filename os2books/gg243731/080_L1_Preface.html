<P>
This document provides an understanding of the architecture and function
of the Multiple Virtual DOS Machines (MVDM) component of OS/2 Version 2.0,
which allows concurrent execution of multiple DOS applications, each in
its own virtual DOS machine.  Further, this document describes the support
for Windows applications under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
This document contains information on the MVDM architecture and components,
including the use of device drivers by DOS applications, and support for
expanded and extended memory.  Other MVDM-related topics discussed in this
document include the DOS Settings feature, which allows the user to determine
the way in which a DOS application runs and the resources available to it,
and Virtual Machine Boot, which allows the user to load any version of DOS
into a virtual DOS machine to support the execution of version-dependent
DOS applications.
<P>
Support for Windows applications on the OS/2 Version 2.0 platform is another
important topic examined in this document.  The document includes a discussion
of Windows device drivers, inter-process communication between Windows,
DOS, and OS/2 applications (including DDE and clipboard capabilities), and
compatibility issues as they relate to Windows applications in the OS/2
Version 2.0 environment.
