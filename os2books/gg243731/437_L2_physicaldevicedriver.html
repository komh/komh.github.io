physical device driver
<P>
Protected mode device driver used by the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating system
and protected mode processes to access hardware devices.  DOS applications
running in virtual DOS machines do not directly access physical device drivers;
virtual device drivers are utilized by these applications, and the virtual
device driver in turn communicates with the physical device driver.
