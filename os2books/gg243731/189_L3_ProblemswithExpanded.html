<H1>Problems with Expanded Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
EMS requires a 64KB block of contiguous free memory in the address range
640KB to 1MB for its page frame. As we can see from <A HREF="032_L2_GeneralOverviewofDif.html">Figure
"General Overview of Different Types of Memory for DOS Applications"</A> this
memory range is shared with BIOS, hardware buffers and device drivers. If
your application reports that no EMS memory is available, even if you have
used the<I> DOS Settings</I> option<I> EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT</I> to set a non-zero
value, it could be that a 64KB page frame location could not be found. See
<A HREF="190_L2_ExpandedMemoryEMSand.html">Expanded Memory (EMS) and Upper
Memory (UMB)</A> on how to resolve this contention.
<P>
If a program returns an error due to insufficient expanded memory, the following
points should be addressed:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ensure that CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT do not
start unnecessary programs that use expanded memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Change the DEVICE= statement for VEMM.SYS in CONFIG.SYS
to provide more expanded memory to every VDM.  Alternatively, use the<I> EMS
Memory Size</I> DOS Settings to allocate more memory to a specific VDM.
 See <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS Settings</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
VEMM for OS/2 was designed to install for EMS only when the DOS application
makes its first EMS request. This was done for two reasons. First, it saves
time and memory. Second, it gives the DOS drivers or applications a chance
to access adapters in the EMS page frame address space. OS/2 V2.0 will recognize
adapters with the ROM signature header, but will not see adapter RAM/MMPIO
areas.
<P>
VEMM determines that it has space available during DOS Session creation
but a DOS program/driver could cause EMS to not install by accessing memory
in the page frame<B> before</B> calling the EMS driver. Lotus 1-2-3 Version
2.3 was found to access the adapter space BEFORE calling EMS. On some machines,
this caused no EMS to be present for Lotus 1-2-3.
<P>
To satisfy this situation, VEMM has than been changed (after GA) to not
wait for the first EMS call. This should clear up the EMS problems related
to programs accessing the adapter address space (X'C0000'-X'E0000'). However,
it should be known that it is now possible for VEMM to claim areas that
could actually be adapter address space. In general, the user should be
aware of this situation. To resolve this we suggest to use the MEM_EXCLUDE
property to force EMS not to use the desired address space.
