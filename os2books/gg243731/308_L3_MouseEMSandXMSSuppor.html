<H1>Mouse, EMS and XMS Support</H1><!-- entering slot 356 -->
<P>
The booted DOS in a VMB session receives XMS (HIMEM), EMS, DPMI and mouse
support services from its VDM environment (assuming the virtual DOS machine
has default DOS settings).  DOS should<I> not</I> therefore load its own
HIMEM, EMS or mouse drivers; indeed they may cause errors in the VDM.
<P>
DOS programs call these services via appropriate API register parameters
and a designated interrupt:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Mouse</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> INT 33h<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>XMS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> INT 2Fh (multiplex)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>EMS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> INT 67h<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These interrupts are trapped by the VDM environment, routed outside the
virtual machine and handled by the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating system itself.
 This may present a problem for certain programs which first test for the
presence of such services by issuing an OPEN command to the associated device
driver, or which check that a valid interrupt handler is referenced by the
Interrupt Vector Table. When a VMB session is started, these device driver
names are not present, and the interrupt vectors point to null handlers.
The application will therefore assume that the required services are not
useable.
<P>
In order to avoid this problem, OS/2 Version 2.0 provides three alternative
"stub" drivers:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->MOUSE.COM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>HIMEM.SYS
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>EMM386.SYS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
These stub drivers are very small (and use minimal memory when loaded) but
satisfy programs which depend on drivers with such names being present.
They respond to OPEN commands, and also set handler addresses in the Interrupt
Vector Table, thereby satisfying applications which check for the presence
of the device drivers in either of these ways.
<P>
The user<I> must</I> load these OS/2 files rather than any similarly named
files which may be shipped with DOS or applications, such as:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>DOS 4.0</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> XMAEM.SYS, XMA2EMS.SYS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DOS
5.0</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, MOUSE.COM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> DR
DOS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> HIDOS.SYS, EMM386.SYS, EMMXMA.SYS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Other
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>MOUSE.SYS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are two ways to achieve this. Assuming OS/2 Version 2.0 is installed
on drive E:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Copy the above OS/2 files from E:\OS2\MDOS to
the DOS diskette, and edit CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT accordingly to load
these files from the A: drive.  VMDISK may then be run to create a bootable
image if desired.
<PRE>   device=a:himem.sys   device=a:emm386.sys
   device=a:fsfilter.sys
</PRE>

<P>
This method should be used if FSFILTER will be loaded into high memory using
DOS 5.0:
<PRE>   device=a:himem.sys
   device=a:emm386.sys
   devicehigh=a:fsfilter.sys</PRE>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Edit CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to load these
files directly from E:\OS2\MDOS. (FSFILTER.SYS must be loaded first if the
OS/2 drive would otherwise be inaccessible to the booted DOS).
<PRE>   device=a:fsfilter.sys
   device=e:\os2\mdos\himem.sys
   device=e:\os2\mdos\emm386.sys
</PRE>

<P>
The second method has one notable advantage; if and when Corrective Service
is applied to the OS/2 Version 2.0 system, and HIMEM, EMM386 or MOUSE are
updated, it is not necessary to update your DOS diskettes and recreate image
files.  FSFILTER itself will have to be updated manually (unless the OS/2
Version 2.0 partition is directly accessible to DOS and FSFILTER is also
loaded from here).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Note that EMS memory<!-- entering slot 357 --> size and frame location are
determined by DOS Settings, and<I> not</I> by parameters on the DEVICE=
statement for EMM386.SYS. It is recommended that EMS and XMS support<I> should
not</I> be configured unless required by the application running in the
VMB session, since this can impact overall system performance.
<P>
We now look at the three different ways to prepare the real DOS to be booted
in the VMB.
