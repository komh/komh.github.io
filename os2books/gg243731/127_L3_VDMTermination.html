<P>
When a VDM is terminated, DOS Emulation closes all handles that have been
assigned to all PDB processes within the VDM. All resources associated with
open FCBs are also closed.
<P>
Since the VDM may have been terminated due to an error in a DOS application
within the VDM, no data within the VDM is relied upon when closing resources
and cleaning up. DOS Emulation explicitly closes both the files and the
OS/2 devices opened by the VDM.
