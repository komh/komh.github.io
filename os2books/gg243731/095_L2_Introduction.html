OS/2 Version 2.0 is designed to fully exploit the advanced features of the
Intel 80386 processor. A major innovation of the 80386 is its support for
the execution of multiple 8086 tasks within the 80386 protected mode environment.
An 8086 task in this environment is called a virtual 8086 (V86) task. Under
OS/2 Version 2.0, V86 tasks are implemented as <A HREF="465_L2_virtualDOSmachine.html"><B>virtual
DOS machines</B> (<B>VDMs</B>)</A>, and each runs as a single-threaded,
protected mode process. See also <A HREF="009_L2_MVDMSystemStructureO.html">Figure
"MVDM System Structure Overview"</A>. The OS/2 scheduler controls task switching
for V86 processes in a way similar to the manner in which it controls other
OS/2 application processes. When a task switch occurs, the VM bit in EFLAGS
contained in the V86 process's task state segment indicates the type of
the current process. If the VM bit is set, indicating that the process is
a VDM, the processor switches to V86 mode.
<P>
In this area, performance has been improved over previous versions of OS/2,
since the processor is<I> never</I> switched to real mode. Switching from
protected mode to real mode takes a long time since all CPU register contents
must be saved and paging must be disabled before DOS registers are loaded.
 Switching to real mode is often accomplished by resetting the CPU, which
is very time consuming. The V86 mode of the processor allows the system
to run both OS/2 and DOS applications in protected mode.

Compared to previous versions of OS/2, DOS applications running in VDMs

<P>
Full-screen graphics applications may be switched to windowed mode where
the graphics will be displayed as a bitmap. Switching between modes can
be done via the system icon menu when in windowed mode. If in full-screen
mode, the user must first switch to the Presentation Manager screen group.
Selecting<I> Windowed</I> in the menu of the DOS program icon switches the
application to windowed mode. To facilitate mode switching, the hot-key
combination<I> Alt+Home</I> may be used.
<P>
While in full-screen mode, the user may copy only the entire contents of
the screen to the clipboard. Switching to windowed mode enables the user
to copy parts of the screen to the clipboard by selecting areas with the
mouse.
<P>
DOS compatibility is achieved through a combination of hardware and software
which ensure the successful execution of DOS applications. Since DOS compatibility
is something of a "moving target", MVDM has been architected to provide
the maximum possible flexibility. When attempting to ensure the proper execution
of a DOS application, typical variable factors to be considered are the
hardware and ROM BIOS of the machine, as well as DOS and the application
itself.

<A HREF="010_L2_MVDMSystemStructurea.html">Figure "MVDM System Structure
and Control Flow"</A> provides an overview of the OS/2 Version 2.0 system
structure, showing the MVDM kernel and virtual device drivers in relation
to key components of the operating system kernel and physical device drivers
which provide services to MVDM.
<P>
Note that virtual device drivers typically access hardware devices through
a physical device driver. Direct communication between virtual device drivers
and the hardware (as shown in <A HREF="010_L2_MVDMSystemStructurea.html">Figure
"MVDM System Structure and Control Flow"</A>) is used only in exceptional
circumstances. One such case is the virtual video device driver, VVIDEO.SYS,
which communicates directly with hardware in order to achieve the highest
possible level of performance.
