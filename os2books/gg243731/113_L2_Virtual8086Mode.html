<H1>Virtual 8086 Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 120 -->
<P>
In a native 8086 environment, the processor does not constrain an application
in any way.  The application may access all available memory and execute
all processor instructions, since it is running as a single task in an unprotected,
real mode environment.  Operating systems and applications written for the
8086 (such as DOS) typically take advantage of this freedom to exercise
direct control over hardware and system resources.
<P>
The 80386 processor exhibits its best performance when running in protected
mode.  However, in the protected mode environment, applications are restricted
to a subset of the system memory and processor instruction set, and real
mode applications written for the 8086 processor can violate the protection
rules imposed by the processor.
<P>
The virtual 8086 mode of the 80386 processor allows an operating system
to integrate existing applications, written for the 8086 processor, into
the protected mode multitasking environment of the 80386, and to execute
such applications concurrently with other 8086 applications and protected
mode applications.
<P>
V86 mode tasks execute in the 80386 processor at privilege level 3, and
are compatible with the virtual memory and paging facilities of the 80386.
 A V86 mode task may execute most 8086 instructions, including those which
reference memory mapped or I/O mapped devices, or which access the 80386
interrupt enable flag.  These instructions may be executed by the 80386
processor directly, or the 80386 operating system may trap and emulate such
instructions.
<P>
Certain 8086 instructions may not be executed in V86 mode; these include
instructions which generate interrupts or exceptions, some of which are
not valid in a normal protected mode task.  However, such instructions may
be valid for a V86 mode task.  For example, an application running in V86
mode may issue an interrupt 21h operating system call.  An 80386 operating
system may register an exception handler to trap and emulate such instructions
at a higher privilege level.
<P>
<A HREF="018_L2_VDMExceptionsandInte.html">Figure "VDM Exceptions and Interrupt
Handling in a V86 Mode Task"</A>
<P>
An interrupt or exception in the V86 mode task causes the processor to switch
from V86 mode to protected mode.  An exception handler running as a protected
mode task at privilege level 0 is then invoked by the 80386 operating system.
This handler first determines that the task which issued the interrupt or
exception instruction is a valid V86 mode task.  It does this by checking
the VM bit in the EFLAGS register.  Two possible states are possible:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>If this bit is set</I>, the current task is a V86
mode task.  The exception handler then invokes a <A HREF="472_L2_virtualmachinemonito.html"><I>virtual
machine monitor</I></A>.
<P>
The virtual machine monitor locates the instruction which caused the interrupt
or exception, decodes the instruction and, if it is a valid 8086 instruction,
simulates its execution by invoking appropriate 80386 operating system services.
 If the instruction is not valid (for example, a privileged 80386 instruction),
the virtual machine monitor terminates the V86 mode task.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>If the bit is not set</I>, the task has issued
an illegal instruction, and is terminated by the virtual machine monitor.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Once the instruction which caused the interrupt or exception has been processed,
the virtual machine monitor transforms the result into the expected format
for the V86 mode task.  It then advances the V86 mode task's EIP (Extended
Instruction Pointer) to the next instruction, and issues an IRET instruction
which causes the processor to switch back to V86 mode and continue execution
of the V86 mode task.
<P>
The<I> 8086 Emulation component of MVDM is a virtual machine monitor.</I>
