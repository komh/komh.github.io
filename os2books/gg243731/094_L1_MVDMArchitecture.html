The Multiple Virtual DOS Machines component of OS/2 Version 2.0 is itself
comprised of a number of subcomponents, which interact with one another
and with the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating system kernel to provide services
to DOS applications running in virtual DOS machines. This chapter describes
each subcomponent of MVDM, and explains the interaction between subcomponents.
