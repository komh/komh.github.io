A20 address line
<P>
The 21st address line of 80x86 CPUs; the first 20 address lines are numbered
0 to 19.  Enabling the A20 address line allows access to the HMA. Note,
however, that many applications assume that the A20 address line  is permanently
disabled, so all programs which use the A20 address line should disable
it when they terminate.
