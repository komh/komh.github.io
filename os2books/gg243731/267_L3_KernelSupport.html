<H1>Kernel Support</H1><!-- entering slot 307 -->
<P>
As well as providing support for DPMI service requests issued by applications,
the operating system must also provide support for the internal control
functions of the DPMI host.  This support is provided by various components
of the operating system kernel.
<P>
<B>8086 Emulation</B>
<P>
The 8086 Emulation component of MVDM emulates the 8086 hardware environment,
and therefore provides a number of services which are used by DPMI.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>DPMI task entry, termination, mode tracking, control
</I>
<P>
When the application calls the protect mode entry to switch to protected
mode, 8086 Emulation sets up tables for reflection of interrupts and exceptions.
 If the DPMI API Layer fails to complete the creation call, 8086 Emulation
cleans up and returns the error to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>VDH service support</I>
<P>
All support for VDH services to the DPMI API Layer is provided through 8086
Emulation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Get/set support for protected mode handler interrupt
and exception handlers</I>.
<P>
Protected mode applications get and set vectors as in DOS.  8086 Emulation
maintains tables of protected mode interrupt handlers and exception handlers.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Interrupt and exception reflection to protected
mode</I>
<P>
8086 Emulation virtualizes interrupts for VDMs.  The reflection of "real
mode" interrupts to protected mode for DPMI applications is therefore performed
with the aid of 8086 Emulation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Protected mode interrupt flag virtualization</I>
<P>
8086 Emulation virtualizes the IF flag while in protected mode.  In V86
mode, IOPL is usually 3 and applications directly change IF without trapping.
 IF flag virtualization is not done while in V86 mode because IOPL must
be 3 to cut down on overhead.  In protected mode, IOPL cannot be 3; otherwise
no port protection is possible.  Therefore, the IF flag is virtualized.
 This prevents VDMs from blocking real interrupts when running in protected
mode.
<P>
To determine if interrupts are allowed in a VDM that has a DPMI application
running, the real IF bit in the CRF is checked.  If interrupts are disabled
here, then they are disabled.  Otherwise, the virtual IF flag indicates
whether interrupts are disabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>HW interrupt support for the Virtual Programmable
Interrupt Controller</I>
<P>
8086 Emulation exports a VDH service to accept notification from the VPIC
when it starts and stops hardware interrupt reflection.  8086 Emulation
also tracks which hardware interrupts are hooked.  The VPIC allocates and
initializes the buffer at creation time in each VDM.
<P>
Any VDD can use this structure to determine if a particular IRQ is hooked.
 The timer VDD, for example, can use this to avoid delivering timer ticks
when the timer tick interrupts are not hooked in either protected mode or
in V86 mode.
<P>
When software interrupts are hooked, 8086 Emulation refers to this structure
to determine if the interrupt is a hardware interrupt.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Services to read/write user space with exception
handling</I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Kernel and VDH service changes for exception handling
when accessing user address space</I>.
<P>
Services called when the client is in protected mode, and which manipulate
the protected mode client address space, must be written to handle protected
mode user space access exceptions.  Services that cannot be called when
the client is in protected mode must specify this in their headers.
<P>
When a service can fault in protected mode, it must return a failure indication
to the DPMI client.  The client then cleans up and exits protected mode
so that the exception can be reflected to the VDM (in V86 mode). This error
also indicates whether a protected mode exception handler will be called.

<P>
<B>Debug Watchpoint Management</B>
<P>
Coordinates watchpoint use with OS/2 protected mode and kernel debugger.

<P>
<B>Memory Management</B>
<P>
Among the kernel services provided by the Virtual Memory Manager are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Allocate VDM LDT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Free VDM LDT<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Allocate contiguous set of LDT descriptors<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Free descriptor<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Query maximum private linear address and ranges of
physical memory<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Query maximum linear<!-- entering slot 308 --> region
and swap space available<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Other memory management services generally used by
the kernel, such as services to allocate, free, and set sparse allocations,
are also used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Once descriptors are allocated they are changed directly by the DPMI API
layer. Applications set descriptors only through requests to the DPMI API
layer, which prevents settings that compromise protection.
