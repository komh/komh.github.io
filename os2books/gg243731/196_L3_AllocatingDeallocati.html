<H1>Allocating/Deallocating Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
Application requests to allocate, reallocate, or deallocate Extended Memory
Blocks are translated into corresponding call to the memory manager.  A
free handle table entry, indicated by a start address of zero, is selected
and updated to contain the start address and size of the memory object.
The total XMS memory size for the system and for each VDM is checked at
this point to ensure that these limits are not exceeded.
<P>
Reallocation requests are serviced by passing the request to a VDH service
and recording the new size and start address.  When an application reallocates
to zero, VXMS requests the memory manager to deallocate the memory object,
and changes the handle table entry so it has zero pages with a sentinel
non-zero address to indicate the handle is still in use. Objects of size
zero are allowed in VXMS, but not in OS/2, so VXMS will deallocate but retain
its own data for the handle.  When a non-zero reallocation is performed
on an object of size zero, a new object is transparently allocated by the
memory manager.
<P>
All allocations (and reallocations) are rounded up to the nearest integral
page multiple.  Since there is no facility for telling the applications
how much memory was actually reserved, the extra memory is wasted.
<P>
<B>High Memory Area</B>
<P>
There is only one HMA per VDM, so a single pointer suffices to manage the
state of the HMA. If the pointer is zero, then the HMA is not in use.  Otherwise,
the pointer contains the linear address of the block of memory being used
to simulate the HMA. Whether the HMA region is mapped to this block of memory
is determined by the state of the simulated A20 line; see section <A HREF="193_L3_HighMemoryAreaHMA.html">High
Memory Area (HMA)</A>.
<P>
When a request for the HMA is made, the pointer is tested against zero.
 If the pointer is non-zero, then the HMA is in use, and the request fails.
Otherwise, the pointer is set to a newly allocated 64KB block of memory,
and the HMA region is mapped to this block if the A20 address line is active.

<P>
When the HMA is released, the block of memory is freed, and the pointer
is reset to 0.  The HMA is then mapped to a black hole if the A20 address
line is active.  Once an HMA is freed, all information previously stored
therein becomes invalid.
<P>
<B>Upper Memory Blocks</B>
<P>
For UMB allocation, a linked list of reserved address ranges is maintained.
 This list contains information about the start address of each reserved
range, the base address of the physical memory block allocated and mapped
into address range, and the length of the block. If the base address is
zero, then the address range is not in use and is instead mapped to a black
hole.
<P>
Allocations are made by searching through the list to find an address range
for which the base address is zero and which is large enough to satisfy
the request.  If the address range exceeds the required size, it is split
into two parts and a new object is allocated to hold the unused portion.

<P>
Deallocations are made by searching the list to find a structure whose starting
address matches the one being deallocated.  The physical memory into which
the address range was mapped is freed, and the address range is instead
remapped to a black hole.  Finally, the newly freed object has its base
address set to zero to signify that it is not in use.  It is then coalesced
with any adjacent free blocks.
<P>
<B>Extended Memory Blocks</B>
<P>
Each VDM has a fixed table of up to 255 EMB handles, the exact number of
which is under user control.  Each entry of the table describes a single
Extended Memory Block.
<P>
Each entry contains a field which records the number of active locks on
the Extended Memory Block.  Locking a handle prevents the corresponding
Extended Memory Block form being reallocated or freed, and also prevents
the base address from changing.  As part of its<!-- entering slot 221 --> function,
the<I> lock</I> subfunction returns the 32-bit base address.
<P>
If an allocation is of size zero, no physical memory allocation is requested,
but a sentinel non-zero address and zero size are recorded in the handle
entry.  The lock count for the newly created Extended Memory Block is reset
to zero.
<P>
When a deallocation request is made for an Extended Memory Block with zero
lock count, the address in the handle is changed to zero, and the memory
manager is called to free the memory.
