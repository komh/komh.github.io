FSFILTER

Utility provided with the VMB component of OS/2 Version 2.0, which allows
the operating system loaded within the VMB session to recognize and access
HPFS drives and large partitions which would otherwise not be accessible
by that operating system.  FSFILTER traps and redirects all disk I/O through
OS/2 Version 2.0's own device drivers.
