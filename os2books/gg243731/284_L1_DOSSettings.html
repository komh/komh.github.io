<H1>DOS Settings</H1><!-- entering slot 325 -->
<P>
In order to provide the highest possible level of compatibility with DOS
applications which make use of particular DOS properties or attributes,
MVDM provides virtual DOS machines with many more customizable properties
than comparable OS/2 sessions.  MVDM provides a common mechanism which supports
standard settings, and allows virtual device drivers to register custom
settings. The CONFIG.SYS file contains a number of standard DOS settings;
 these are applied to all VDMs as they are created.  Other settings may
be specified for individual VDMs.
<P>
When running Windows applications in VDMs under OS/2 Version 2.0, certain
DOS settings should be altered from their default values.  The recommended
values for these settings when running Windows applications are discussed
in <A HREF="233_L3_DOSandWINOS2Settings.html">DOS and WIN-OS/2 Settings</A>.

<P>
DOS settings are used during creation and initialization of a VDM, and certain
settings may also be altered dynamically during VDM execution. During initialization
of the VDM, the VDM_CREATE hooks for all virtual device drivers defined
for that VDM are called by the Virtual DOS Machine Manager.  At this point,
the virtual device drivers may call the<B> VDHQueryProperty()</B> helper
service to get the values for required settings.
