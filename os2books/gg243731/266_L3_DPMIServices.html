<H1>DPMI Services</H1><!-- entering slot 304 -->
<P>
DPMI services are requested using INT 31h requests, which are trapped by
the DPMI virtual device driver, and either serviced by the VDD itself or
routed to the operating system kernel.
<P>
The DPMI API Layer performs input parameter checking on all service requests,
to validate requests and to enforce restrictions mandated by the DPMI specification.

<P>
<B>LDT Descriptor Management</B>
<P>
The 8086 Emulation component of MVDM arranges for allocation of a task's
LDT upon initialization of the VDM.  Under DPMI 0.9, all tasks in a VDM
share the same LDT.  Applications may modify descriptors only through DPMI
service calls.
<P>
Three types of descriptors must be kept track of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Per-task DPMI descriptors that the client may
modify<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->V86 segment to selector mappings with descriptors
that cannot be modified<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Per-task DOS descriptors that the client cannot
modify.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Memory used by a DPMI application is allocated by the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating
system to the parent process of the VDM within which that application executes.
 Full memory protection is therefore provided for applications using DPMI
services.
<P>
<B>DOS Memory Management</B>
<P>
DOS memory management services are implemented under OS/2 Version 2.0 in
various ways, according to the nature of the service.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Allocate DOS memory and selector set</I>
<P>
This service allocates DOS memory along with a set of descriptors to cover
the allocation.  For 32-bit clients, a single descriptor is set to cover
the entire allocated region.  For 16-bit clients, this descriptor is followed
by descriptors to cover the rest of the region in 64KB segments.  This allows
16-bit applications to refer either through a single large segment or through
tiled selectors.
<P>
A V86 mode DOS call is used to allocate memory from the DOS arena. Therefore,
after initial setup, the DPMI API Layer switches back into V86 mode to issue
the DOS call, and then traps the return from DOS in order to finish the
service.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Free DOS memory and selector set</I>
<P>
The allocated list is searched to make sure the region being freed is allocated.
 The allocation record is moved to the pending list with the request marked
as free.  A switch is then made to V86 mode and the INT 21h is simulated
as above with the return trapped.  When the return is trapped, return values
are set up.  If the call succeeded, the selectors that were allocated are
freed.  If a selector other than the allocated selector was passed in the
free call, that selector set is freed as well.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Resize DOS memory and selector set</I>
<P>
Resizing is done in the same way as the original allocation.  The allocation
record is moved to the pending list.  The desired size is listed in the
allocation record and new selectors are allocated if the size increases
and new selectors are needed.  Descriptors are allocated before reflection
so the call can fail before allocating DOS memory in V86 mode if they are
not available.  The DOS call is then done as above.
<P>
If the call failed, the new selectors are freed when the hook regains control.
 If it succeeded, new descriptors are set up if they were needed or descriptors
are freed if the resize made some unnecessary. The return values for the
client are set up and the allocation record is returned to the allocated
list with its new size noted.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Extended Memory Management</B>
<P>
Extended memory management services are also implemented in a number of
ways, depending on the service.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Get memory information</I>
<P>
This service uses memory management calls to load an application buffer
with a variety of information about the memory.  A VDH service is used to
copy the<!-- entering slot 305 --> data to user space, with appropriate
exception handling.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Allocate</I>
<P>
Memory is allocated using a memory management service.  Record of the allocation
noting the start address, allocated size, and sparse linear address size
are kept in a hash table.  The allocation records are kept in the DPMI API
Layer per DPMI task area so that they can be cleaned up when the task terminates.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Free</I>
<P>
This function is implemented quite simply; the DPMI API Layer per-task data
area is checked for the allocation records, and the corresponding memory
is freed via a call to the operating system kernel.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Resize</I>
<P>
DPMI changes a memory object's size in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the size of the object is to be decreased, pages
at the end of the object are decommitted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->If the size of the object is to be increased, a new
and larger object is allocated and a kernel worker is used to move the pages
from the original object to the new one.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Page Locking</B>
<P>
Page locking services are necessary on systems which deliver interrupts
at interrupt time or which use DOS for paging.  On a system that simulates
interrupts and has its own file system (such as OS/2 Version 2.0)  the calls
are no-ops.  They will simply return a success indication to the client.

<P>
<B>Interrupt Hooking</B>
<P>
8086 Emulation maintains a table of the current handler for each protect
mode hook and exception.  These services are implemented by calling 8086
Emulation to get the current value from this table or to set a new value
in the table.
<P>
8086 Emulation offers a service to change the client's virtual interrupt
state (the IF flag).
<P>
<B>Translation (Protect/V86 Control Transfer)</B>
<P>
These services provide cross-mode calls, state saving, and raw mode switching.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Real mode callback</I> (call protected mode from
real mode)
<P>
This service allocates a real mode callback breakpoint.  When this breakpoint
is called, the DPMI API Layer handler arranges a protect mode call.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Free real mode callback</I>
<P>
If a real mode callback is still waiting to be completed, the callback record
is marked to indicate it is no longer active.  Freeing the callback record
and the breakpoint are done when no outstanding calls are in progress.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>State save/restore for each mode</I>
<P>
This service returns a set of addresses, one for V86 mode and one for protect
mode, which, if called by the client, save or restore the current register
state for the other mode.  This is necessary for applications which perform
raw mode switching, to keep them from overwriting the task state for the
alternate mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Raw mode switching
<P>
This service returns a set of addresses, one for V86 mode and one for protect
mode, which, if called by the client, switch to the other mode. The breakpoints
have the DPMI task identifier in the breakpoint data area.  When the breakpoint
is reached, if the ID is different from the current one, 8086 Emulation
is called to report the switch.  A VDH service is then used to do the requested
mode switch.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, an extension to the DPMI specification has been
implemented, and is known as<B> DOS API</B> services.  Protected mode applications
issuing DOS or BIOS calls must pass buffers that can be accessed in V86
mode.  The DOS API services relieve the application from having to do this
work for DOS calls and some BIOS calls.  This permits protected mode applications
to use protect mode buffers (referenced by protected mode selectors) in
DOS service requests.  The translation services perform any necessary buffer
copying.
<P>
Applications detect the<!-- entering slot 306 --> presence of a DOS API
translator by performing an INT 2Fh multiplex passing the name "MS-DOS"
as an argument.  The translator responds when it detects this name, indicating
that translation will be performed.  Applications that do not require translation
may simply use the INT 31h simulate interrupt function to avoid translation.

<P>
<B>Debug Registers</B>
<P>
The Task Management component of OS/2 Version 2.0 manages watchpoints for
OS/2 applications, the kernel debugger and VDMs.  Interfaces for allocating,
setting and freeing watchpoints and getting the Bx bits for allocated watchpoints
are used by the DPMI API Layer to carry out these services.  The DPMI API
Layer keeps track of allocated watchpoints in the per DPMI task area so
that it can clean up at termination and uses the tasking watchpoint services
to manipulate watchpoints.
<P>
<B>Other DPMI Services</B>
<P>
A number of other services are provided under the DPMI specification. Their
implementation under OS/2 Version 2.0 is described below.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Physical Address Mapping</I>
<P>
In OS/2 Version 2.0, there is no way of knowing which addresses are used
by device drivers.  It is therefore not safe to allow direct access to devices
which do not have VDDs.  However, direct access from within VDMs is allowed.

<P>
VDH services for reserving linear space, mapping, and page fault handling
are all restricted to regions below 1MB+64KB.  As such, a VDD with a linear
address above 1 MB cannot virtualize hardware.  All requests to this service
will fail.  The DPMI specification allows this so the operating system can
protect devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Get Vendor Specific Entry Point</I>
<P>
Vendors that add extensions to DPMI typically look for the name of their
extension by hooking INT 31h.  If the extension is requested by a DPMI client,
the vendor-supplied routine issues an IRET instruction without jumping down
the INT 31h protect mode chain.  If the request is for a DPMI service not
supplied by the vendor's routine , the routine continues down the INT 31h
chain.  Since the DPMI API Layer router is called at the end of the chain,
any unrecognized service requests are signalled to the client by setting
the carry flag to indicate that the call failed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
