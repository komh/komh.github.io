<H1>VDM Window Management</H1><!-- entering slot 111 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides for the ability to run a V86 task in a window.
The PMShield manages windowed VIO sessions input/output and windowed VDM
input/output.
<P>
The video VDD (Virtual Device Driver) intercepts all I/O instructions to
the video adapter, and all screen updates will be redirected/mapped to a
logical video buffer (LVB) maintained by the Video VDD. When the Video VDD
detects changes in a VDM's video state, it notifies a new PMShield thread,
providing it with update information for a specified VDM window. This thread
is a high-priority thread that serves the needs of all windowed VDMs.
<P>
For keyboard and mouse input, the PMShield must simply transform keystroke
and mouse event messages into calls to the keyboard and mouse VDDs.
