<H1>Managing the VMB Session</H1><!-- entering slot 364 -->
<P>
The user may interact with a VMB session in a similar way to any other virtual
DOS machine.  The session may be scaled, minimized, maximized and switched
between windowed and full-screen mode, and is subject to the same graphics
mode limitations when windowed. However, a VMB session<I> cannot</I> be
ended by typing EXIT at its command prompt. The session can<I> only</I> be
closed from its system icon or the Window List.
<P>
Note that Ctrl-Alt-Del will reboot<I> the entire OS/2 Version 2.0 operating
system</I>, not just the foreground virtual machine session.
