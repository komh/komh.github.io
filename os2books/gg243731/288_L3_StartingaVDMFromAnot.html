<H1>Starting a VDM From Another Application</H1><!-- entering slot 329 -->
<P>
The<B> DosStartSession()</B> function under OS/2 Version 2.0 provides an
<I>environment</I> pointer as one of its parameters.  This pointer references
a buffer which is used when creating a VDM.  This buffer contains the buffer
length, followed by one or more DOS settings.  For each setting, the buffer
specifies the type, name and value.  The operating system parses the settings
buffer as part of the<B> DosStartSession()</B> processing, in order to create
initial values for these settings.  Default values are assumed for any registered
settings not specified in the<B> DosStartSession()</B> call.
<P>
For any settings which have not been registered, the information in the
buffer is ignored.  This allows the system to run without errors in the
case where the virtual device driver that registered a setting is not loaded
(for example, CONFIG.SYS was changed), and yet the Presentation Manager
shell has saved a value for that setting.
