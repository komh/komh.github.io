EMS logical page
<P>
Each memory object that is allocated is divided into logical pages. To refer
to a particular piece of allocated memory, an application uses a handle
to point to the object and a logical page number (starting from 0) to indicate
the offset into the object.  Logical pages are always relative to a handle.
