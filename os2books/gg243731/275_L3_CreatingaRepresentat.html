<H1>Creating a Representative Object</H1><!-- entering slot 316 -->
<P>
To define a DOS application as an object under the Workplace Shell, do the
following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open the<I> Templates</I> folder on the desktop,
and copy the<I> Program</I> object by pointing to it with the mouse pointer,
holding down mouse button 2 and dragging the icon to the desktop or to the
folder in which the DOS application will reside.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The<I> settings</I> view for the new object will
automatically open. On the<I> Program</I> page of the<I> settings</I> notebook,
complete the<I> Program title</I> and<I> Path and file name</I> fields for
the application. The<I> Parameters</I> and<I> Working directory</I> fields
are optional, and depend on the application being installed. Users should
check the documentation supplied with the DOS application.
<P>
<A HREF="055_L2_TheProgramPageoftheS.html">Figure "The Program Page of the
Settings Notebook"</A><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->On the<I> Session</I> page, select either<I> DOS
Window</I> or<I> DOS Full Screen</I>, depending on how the DOS application
will be run.  In most cases, it is sufficient to select<I> DOS Window</I> since
when maximized, the window will allow the full 25 rows by 80 columns to
be displayed.
<P>
Another advantage of selecting<I> DOS Window</I> is that the user can use
the copy and paste functions of the VDM to selectively transfer data between
the DOS application, the clipboard, and any other application on the desktop
that supports the clipboard. However, some graphics applications suffer
performance degradation when run in windowed mode. For such applications,
<I>DOS Full Screen</I> should be selected.
<P>
Note that once the VDM is started, a user can switch between<I> DOS Window
</I>and<I> DOS Full Screen</I> modes by holding down the<I> Alt</I> key
and pressing the<I> Home</I> key.
<P>
Do not confuse running a DOS application full screen with running it in
a full screen window (a maximized window that fills the entire screen).
There can be a significant performance difference between the two.
<P>
Note that clipboard function<I> Copy All</I> is also available for full
screen virtual DOS machines. This allows the user to copy the entire DOS
full screen to the clipboard (there is no way to mark only a portion of
the screen). To perform this function, the user must press Ctrl+Esc to return
to the desktop, click on the application icon with mouse button 2, and select
<I>Copy All</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->On the<I> General</I> page, complete the<I> Title
</I>field. The user can optionally choose to display a different icon from
the default<I> DOS Window</I> or<I> DOS Full Screen</I> icons.
<P>
<A HREF="056_L2_TheSessionPageoftheS.html">Figure "The Session Page of the
Settings Notebook"</A><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->If you select the<I> DOS settings</I> push button,
the system brings up another dialog. In this dialog, you can setup all DOS/VDM
relevant characteristics, unique to this particular program object.
<P>

<P>
When the<I> settings</I> notebook is closed, the application will appear
on the desktop or in the folder, with the specified application name beneath
its icon.
