<P>
As mentioned in the previous section, Windows applications may be automatically
migrated to the Workplace Shell desktop at OS/2 installation time. However,
for applications which are not defined in the Certified Application Database,
or which are installed after OS/2 installation, a Workplace Shell object
may be created from a template in the<I> Templates</I> folder.  For such
applications, the WIN-OS/2 application execution environment is defined
to the Workplace Shell using the<I> Program</I> page of the program object's
<I>Settings</I> notebook.

<P>
The<I> Session</I> page allows the user to change Windows settings via the
<I>Windows Settings</I> dialog. This page defines whether the Windows kernel
will execute in real, standard, or Auto-Select mode.<I> Auto-Select</I> mode
is highlighted as the default.  All DOS settings are selectable for Windows
applications via the<I> Windows Setting</I> dialog;  Windows settings are
included in the same list.
