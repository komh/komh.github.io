<P>
DDE support between Windows applications and Presentation Manager applications
requires that the DDEServer be linked with the Presentation Manager DDE
APIs.  Both DDE messages and data formats are translated during the data
exchange between Presentation Manager and any given VDM running a Windows
application. This process consists of a protected mode DDEServer, a Windows
DDE ServerAgent, as described above, and a Presentation Manager DDE ServerAgent.
The Presentation Manager DDE ServerAgent is a mirror to the Windows DDE
ServerAgent. The ServerAgent is responsible for routing all DDE messages
beyond the confines of Presentation Manager to the DDEServer. The ServerAgent
communicates with the DDEServer via named pipes.
<P>
The DDE process between Presentation Manager applications and Windows applications
may be represented as in <A HREF="053_L2_DDEProcessbetweenPre.html">Figure
"DDE Process between Presentation Manager and Windows"</A>.
<P>
The following data formats are translated between the Presentation Manager
 environment and the Windows environment:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Bitmaps:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Windows DIB format to/from OS/2
BITMAPINFO2 and Presentation Manager BITMAPINFO to/from Windows DIB format.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Windows Device Dependent Bitmaps:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Pre-Windows
3.0 format to Windows DIB format to/from Presentation Manager  BITMAPINFO.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Windows Metafiles:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Metafiles
are converted to Window DIB format prior to being translated as above.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> PM
Metafiles:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> PM metafiles are first converted
to Window DIB format prior to being translated as above, and are then forwarded
to the global clipboard.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Text:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Codepage
translation is provided in both directions, if required.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any data format which is not supported by the<I> global</I> DDEServer translation
routines, can still be used on a<I> local</I> base, that means within the
same VDM.
<P>
The Presentation Manager DDE ServerAgent will reside as a utility in a<I> Productivity
</I>folder on the Workplace Shell.  Where there is a demand to provide DDE
support between Presentation Manager applications and Windows applications,
the Presentation Manager DDE ServerAgent should be placed in the<I> Workplace
Startup</I> folder.  The DDE ServerAgent runs<I> only</I> as a minimized
icon. To shut down global DDE, the Presentation Manager  DDE ServerAgent
must be terminated through the Window List.
<P>
If a<I> seamless</I> Windows session is started, the DDE ServerAgent will
automatically be started, so that this particular Windows application can
automatically use DDE.  Otherwise, it would appear to be isolated and this
would confuse the novice user.
<P>
Existing DDE support between Presentation Manager applications remains essentially
unchanged. Where DDE is only used between Presentation Manager applications,
the DDEServer should be deactivated to improve performance.
