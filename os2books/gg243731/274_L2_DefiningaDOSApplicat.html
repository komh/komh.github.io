<H1>Defining a DOS Application</H1><!-- entering slot 315 -->
<P>
A DOS application is typically defined to the Workplace Shell by creating
a representative object for the application, and configuring the properties
of that object using the<I> settings</I> view.  Configuring an object in
this way allows the application to take advantage of the many customizable
properties of the OS/2 Version 2.0 VDM  environment, and to tailor this
environment to provide optimum performance and application compatibility.
