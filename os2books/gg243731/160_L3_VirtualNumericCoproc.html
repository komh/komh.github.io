<H1>Virtual Numeric Coprocessor Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 171 -->
<P>
The virtual numeric coprocessor device driver VNPX.SYS provides virtualization
of the 80287/80387 numeric coprocessor hardware, allowing access to numeric
coprocessor facilities by multiple DOS applications running in virtual DOS
machines.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a physical device driver for the numeric coprocessor,
within the operating system kernel.  At system initialization time, VNPX
registers a number of hooks with the physical device driver, so that VNPX
is informed whenever a numeric coprocessor exception or emulation trap occurs.
Handling routines are also registered with the Virtual DOS Machine Manager,
and are invoked upon VDM creation and termination.  Coprocessor I/O ports
visible to V86 mode applications are hooked by VNPX.
<P>
VNPX is informed by the physical device driver at initialization time, whether
VDMs are permitted to use the coprocessor.  Upon VDM creation, VNPX sets
the equipment summary flag for the numeric coprocessor according to the
information received at initialization time.  In the event of the coprocessor
being unavailable to DOS applications, the equipment summary flag is turned
off.  An application interrogating the flag will therefore assume that no
coprocessor is present, and take appropriate action.
<P>
The first time an application in a VDM executes a coprocessor instruction
within a particular timeslice, an exception condition (Trap 0007) occurs.
The exception handler sets a flag within the physical device driver before
allowing processing of the instruction to continue.  This flag is checked
at task switch time and if it is set, the coprocessor state is saved by
the physical device driver.  Note that the save operation takes place<I> only
</I>if the coprocessor is used by an application during its timeslice; for
those applications which do not use the coprocessor, no action is taken.
 This allows optimum performance during task switching.
