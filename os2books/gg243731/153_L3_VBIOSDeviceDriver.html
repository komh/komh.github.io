<H1>VBIOS Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 161 -->
<P>
The VBIOS virtual device driver is like any other base virtual device driver
except that it is loaded before any other virtual device drivers.  This
driver is loaded and initialized first, so that other virtual device drivers
can use services provided by VBIOS.
<P>
The system BIOS reserves physical memory for the interrupt vector table,
ROM and EBIOS data areas.  This reservation is done by an indication in
the<I> arena info</I> data structure passed to the kernel. These physical
pages are treated as "unavailable" by the virtual memory manager.
<P>
During virtual device driver initialization, the physical interrupt vector
table and ROM data area (previously allocated/reserved by the BIOS) are
mapped with the<B> VDHMapMem()</B> function.  VBIOS also installs hooks
which cause its own VDM creation handler to be invoked, and an I/O hooking
routine to be invoked when all virtual device drivers have been initialized
for a particular VDM.
<P>
Space is also reserved for the EBIOS data area (if the machine is a PS/2)
and the system ROM linear address ranges.  This allows virtual device drivers
to use and modify this information globally (affecting all VDMs created
thereafter).
<P>
The following steps are taken when initializing the BIOS for a newly created
VDM:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Map the CBIOS system area to the VDM address
space, using the<B> VDHMapMem()</B> service.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Allocate memory for the interrupt vector table
and ROM BIOS data area.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Map and copy the physical interrupt vector table
and ROM BIOS data area into the VDMs linear address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Allocate memory for the extended BIOS data area
in the VDM's linear address space (only on PS/2s).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Map and copy the physical extended BIOS data
area into the linear address space.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
When VBIOS's VDM_CREATE_DONE handler is called (after all virtual device
drivers' VDM_CREATE handlers have been invoked), VBIOS attempts to install
I/O hook routines for the serial and parallel ports COMx and LPTx.  These
hook routines will take effect<I> only</I> if the virtual COM device driver
or the virtual printer device driver have not successfully hooked the I/O
ports. VBIOS I/O hook routines are used only to display pop-up messages
when the device is not virtualized, and to terminate the VDM on user request.
