<P>
Provision of DOS compatibility requires a combination of hardware, operating
system, and application software support. The MVDM DOS Emulation component
of OS/2 Version 2.0 addresses only the software aspects of providing DOS
compatibility; the VDM Manager, 8086 Emulation and virtual device drivers
work together to provide hardware and ROM BIOS compatibility.
<P>
DOS Emulation provides DOS services to DOS applications running in a virtual
DOS machine in such a way as to provide maximum compatibility with the same
services provided to DOS applications running under native DOS 5.0.
<P>
DOS Emulation is implemented by running a very small portion of the DOS
Emulation kernel in V86 mode and a much larger portion of code in protected
mode outside the VDM. In OS/2 Version 2.0, physical device drivers are loaded
above 1MB and only the DOS Emulation kernel resides below 1MB; hence, any
user-installed OS/2 device drivers will not affect the amount of application
space available to a DOS application running in a VDM. Similarly, adding
LAN drivers to the OS/2 configuration to support the network server or redirector
functions does not take up DOS application space, even though DOS applications
may make use of these network devices. Virtual device drivers are also loaded
outside the VDM  address space, and therefore do not reduce the amount of
memory available to a DOS application.
<P>
In this way, the MVDM architecture makes available to DOS applications the
maximum amount of memory. In fact, up to 630KB is free for multiple DOS
sessions; this represents an increase of about 100KB over memory available
to the single DOS session that was available under OS/2 Version 1.3. Note
that this amount may be reduced if DOS device drivers and/or TSR programs
are loaded in a VDM.
<P>
DOS Emulation supports all documented DOS interrupts and features. In addition,
some undocumented aspects of these functions (especially INT 21h) are supported
because a large number of significant DOS applications rely upon these interfaces.
