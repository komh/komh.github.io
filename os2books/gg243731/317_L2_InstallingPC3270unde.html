<H1>Installing PC/3270 under WIN-OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 368 -->
<P>
You must have installed OS/2 Version 2.0, including the WIN-OS/2 support
in order for this to work.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
This will start up the WIN-OS/2 environment. You will get the WIN-OS/2 Program
Manager screen, just as you would if you had started Windows natively. From
here the installation of the product and the corrective service is just
as it would be under Windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

</UL> Now
you will fill out the installation and configuration screens just as you
would have installing PC/3270 directly under Windows.
<P>
In this sample installation we will use the following throughout this part
of the document:
<PRE>   C:           is the drive where OS/2 Version 2.0 is installed   C:\PC3270W   is the drive and subdirectory where PC/3270 is installed
   PC3270W      is the name of the configuration file we create</PRE>

<P>
Our sample will use DFT, but you can select the one you want. We have tested
DFT, LAN 802.2, SDLC and IIN Async at 9600bps.
<P>
If you select other than DFT, you will need to configure your communications
parameters before you can continue. You will need to refer to other documentation
for this configuration information.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Select 2 for Number of Host sessions. Yours
will probably vary, but start simple.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

be three more pop-up screens with information about the installation completion,
just select OK on each of them to complete the installation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> If you are configuring 802.2 LAN installations, you will
probably get a PCS121 error at the completion of the install. This is because
the install process is trying to update the CONFIG.SYS file and is having
problems. Just continue with installing the corrective service diskette
in the next section.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
