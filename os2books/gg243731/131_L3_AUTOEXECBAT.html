<H1>AUTOEXEC.BAT</H1><!-- entering slot 139 -->
<P>
AUTOEXEC.BAT is specific to the virtual DOS machine environment and has
no effect on the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating system. The AUTOEXEC.BAT file
starts memory-resident programs, such as network programs, and sets up environment
variables.  In addition, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file may also define the command
prompt.
<P>
The default AUTOEXEC.BAT file for all VDMs in OS/2 Version 2.0 is shown
in <A HREF="024_L2_DefaultAUTOEXECBATFi.html">Figure "Default AUTOEXEC.BAT
File"</A>.
<P>
In the above AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the LOADHIGH command loads the APPEND TSR
into the High Memory Area, thus making available more memory to all DOS
applications running in every VDM.  This example assumes that the function
performed by the SET COMSPEC command, which is often found in AUTOEXEC.BAT,
has been moved to CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> In order to maximize the amount of base memory available
to applications, any unnecessary commands should be removed from AUTOEXEC.BAT.
Commands should only be included in AUTOEXEC.BAT if they are required for
every VDM. Commands which are required only for a specific DOS application
to be run in a VDM should be placed into a batch file. This batch file should
be explicitly entered into the<I> path and file name</I> field of the "parameters
field" in the DOS Settings notebook on the "program page" for that specific
application.
