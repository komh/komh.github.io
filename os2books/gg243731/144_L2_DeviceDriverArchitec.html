<P>
The architecture and structure of a device driver differs considerably,
depending on whether the device driver is physical or virtual.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 makes use of two distinct types of device driver to communicate
between the operating system and hardware devices:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="437_L2_physicaldevicedriver.html"><B>Physical
device drivers</B></A> are considered as<I> true</I> device drivers in the
sense that they have a unique and rigid file structure, and interface directly
with the hardware. They operate in protected mode, and are accessed by protected
mode processes and by virtual device drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><A HREF="462_L2_virtualdevicedriver.html"><B>Virtual
device drivers</B></A> are essentially a dynamic link library conforming
to the EXE32 Load Module format, and generally do not interface directly
with hardware devices. Instead, virtual device drivers are responsible for
presenting a virtual copy of a hardware resource to DOS applications running
in virtual DOS machines, and for coordinating physical access to that resource.
DOS applications typically address hardware devices directly using interrupts;
the virtual device driver allows the VDM environment to appear to the DOS
application as though the application had direct control over the hardware.
Virtual device drivers include a stub which executes in V86 mode within
each VDM, while the main portion of the virtual device driver executes in
protected mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

The relationship between applications, physical and virtual device drivers,
and hardware devices is shown in <A HREF="025_L2_PhysicalandVirtualDe.html">Figure
