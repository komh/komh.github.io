<H1>Running Lotus 1-2-3 in a VDM</H1><!-- entering slot 387 -->
<P>
Lotus 1-2-3 is one of the most popular DOS programs available. Many customers
use one or another of the several versions on the market. Frequently, they
encounter problems of insufficient RAM to process their large spreadsheets.

<P>
This appendix discusses how to set up and run Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.3 (which
can use EMS memory), and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3.1+ (which uses DPMI memory)
in a virtual DOS machine in OS/2 V2.0 to handle large spreadsheets.
