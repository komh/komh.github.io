The following settings control screen I/O operations within a VDM.
<P>
<B>VIDEO_FASTPASTE</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Speeds up input from other sources
than the keyboard.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Improves
the speed of paste operations from the clipboard to a DOS application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Does not work with all applications (in particular,
some applications which monitor keyboard interrupts directly may experience
errors).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Off.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time.  This facilitates easy experimentation by the user.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Pasting into the DOS command prompt, or any
application using DOS Console I/O functions, will generally work. However,
the Microsoft Editor (M) and its successor, Programmer's Workbench (PWB),
can fail when using fast pasting because they rebuffer keystrokes in an
internal buffer, which can overflow.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_MODE_RESTRICTION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Extends the 640KB DOS address
space by limiting video mode support.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>For text-based or CGA graphics based applications,
the video memory normally reserved just above 640KB for high-resolution
graphics modes can be remapped to conventional memory, providing an additional
64KB (or 96KB, depending on graphics mode) for DOS applications, TSRs, and
other programs.  This is valuable for applications that do not take advantage
of EMS or XMS memory extenders.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> It
is not possible to completely hide the fact that the video adapter is high-resolution
graphics-capable;  some applications may attempt to enable those modes and
use the memory above 640KB as video memory, inadvertently corrupting application
data.  Care must therefore be taken when using this feature.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>NONE.  The complete list of settings is:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>None
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>CGA modes only (adds 96KB)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>MONO modes only (adds 64KB).
<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
VDM creation only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_ONDEMAND_MEMORY</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Reduces swap space requirements
for fullscreen VDMs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Allows
a full-screen VDM to run without pre-allocating a virtual video buffer for
the worst-case video modes (high-resolution graphics modes).  Using this
setting does not prevent execution of graphics applications; it simply means
that allocation of the buffer is delayed until it is needed.  This can save
a substantial amount of memory/swap space, which might be important under
certain low-memory conditions. It also enables you to start a program quickly.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> If allocation
of a virtual video buffer for a full-screen VDM fails at the time the application
changes video modes, the session must be frozen and switched back to the
shell.  Unless the user is able to free memory from another session, he
may be unable to get the DOS application running again.  This is a concern
if the application contains unsaved data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Off.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.  This<!-- entering slot 345 --> allows the user to save memory
the next time the session is switched to full-screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>None.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Simulates the video retrace status
port to provide faster access.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> DOS
applications that poll the video retrace status port often write to the
screen only during the retrace interval, even though it is safe (on EGA
and VGA adapters) to draw at any time without causing interference (also
known as "snow").  This feature causes most applications to write to the
screen more often, and compensates for the performance drag imposed by monitoring
the port in the first place.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Some
applications may poll the port in such a way that overall performance is
worse; this is sometimes true of applications that draw only during vertical
(not horizontal) retrace.  Unfortunately, while turning off trace emulation
will restore performance, there is a risk that screen-switching will not
be as reliable.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> On.
 Reliable screen-switching has higher priority over the minority of applications
that will experience some drag in performance.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>At any time.  This allows the user to experiment
with different settings in the event of a performance problem.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>None.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_ROM_EMULATION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Emulates selected INT 10h ROM
Video functions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Provides
faster output for selected video functions than ROM services typically provide.
 This also has a dramatic effect on the performance of those functions in
a window.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Some
ROMs may offer enhanced services that are not included in the emulation.
 Applications which rely upon these services may not execute correctly.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> On.  Because
the INT 10h ROM Video services are well-documented, incompatibilities are
unlikely and the performance benefits of using the emulation are quite significant.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time.  This allows the user to experiment in the event of a compatibility
problem.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Notifies a DOS application of
a switch to/from full-screen mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Allows applications that monitor this notification
to redraw their screens as needed.  This may be necessary for some video
adapters that provide modes (and applications that use those modes) which
are not fully supported by the OS/2 video driver or which are slightly incompatible.
 It is also valuable in situations where an OS/2 video driver has not allocated
a virtual video buffer (see VIDEO_8514_XGA_IOTRAP below). Use this setting
if you use the<I> VIDEO_ONDEMAND_MEMORY</I> DOS setting, because concurrent
buffer allocation and screen switching can make a screen go black.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>When used indiscriminately, this feature may
cause unnecessary and time-consuming screen redrawing.  For standard MONO/CGA/EGA/VGA
video modes, the OS/2 video driver should be able to restore application
screens without assistance.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Off.
 For standard hardware and standard video modes, this feature is not necessary.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time.  This allows the user to experiment in the event of a compatibility
problem.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Windows
2.x and 3.x understand this notification and will redraw themselves accordingly.
For WIN-OS/2 sessions, set this setting on.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_WINDOW_REFRESH</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Adjusts the window update<!-- entering slot 346 --> frequency
for a given VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> For
applications (particularly graphics) that write frequently to video memory,
this value can be increased to reduce time spent updating the window and
provide more processor time for the application.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> This has no effect on updates based on other events such
as keyboard input or synchronous scrolling operations or any video events
other than refresh.<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<P>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> A large
refresh period can make an application unusable (or at least, very hard
to use).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> 0.1
seconds.  This has been found to yield the best overall performance.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>At any time, in increments of 0.1 seconds.
 This allows for experimentation.  The range is from 0.1 to 60.0 seconds.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> This setting
affects normal TTY-style output.  Compare a DIR or TYPE operation before
and after altering this setting.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VIDEO_8514_XGA_IOTRAP</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> When set OFF, unrestricted access
to 8514/A display adapter hardware.  Note that this setting is<I> only</I> available
for systems with 8514/A display adapters installed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Achieves higher performance for 8514/A applications
and eliminates the overhead of the 1MB 8514/A virtual video buffer normally
allocated for each VDM when set OFF.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Screen-switching away from the application
will result in immediate freezing of the application, and the system may
not be able to reliably switch back; that is, the screen image may not be
correct.  This may be overcome by setting VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION on,
which notifies applications to redraw their own screen images.  Note however,
that not all applications will take advantage of the notification.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> An application with this setting enabled may not be run in
windowed mode, or copied to the clipboard, because there is no complete
information about its state.<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<P>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Off.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>At VDM creation only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>When executing Windows 3.0 with the 8514/A
display driver, certain operations such as painting dithered backgrounds
will run significantly faster.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
