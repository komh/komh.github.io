<H1>Installing Additional Fonts for WIN-OS/2 ATM</H1><!-- entering slot 276 -->
<P>
Before installing<I> any</I> additional fonts for WIN-OS/2 make sure that
<I>all</I> of your printers are installed and that they are configured for
the correct output port. WIN-OS/2 maintains its font information in the
ATM.INI for non-PostScript printers and in the WIN.INI for PostScript printers.
For PostScript printers this means that PostScript printers installed<I> after
</I>the font installation<I> will not</I> have those fonts in their list.
Also if you change the output port of an installed PostScript printer then
your fonts will disappear unless the new port also had a PostScript printer
assigned to it while the fonts were being installed.
<P>
To install an additional font:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open the<B> ATM Control Panel</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on<B> Add...</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Double Click on the source of the new font(s)
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on the<B> Font files</B> you wish to add
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on<B> Add</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on<B> Exit</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
You<I> must</I> restart Windows to access the new fonts. The system will
prompt you to do this.
<P>
<B>Important: </B> When you install the fonts the system will prompt you
with suggested paths for the files. Although you may change the path, remember
one thing: OS2 PM ATM will be installing the .PFB file as well and will
place it in a different directory. You will be tempted to use the same directory
for both OS/2 PM and WIN-OS/2. We recommend that you use the default settings
because when you delete a font with the OS/2 PM Font Palette it will also
delete the .PFB font file! This will make the font unusable, although still
installed, in WIN-OS/2. Allowing the system to keep your OS/2 PM and WIN-OS/2
fonts separate will save a lot of confusion in managing fonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
<B>Note:  </B> The internal file format is different from the standard core
fonts delivered with OS/2 V2.0. Those have been modified for performance
reasons, where these fonts are installed as standard Type 1 fonts. :enote.

<P>
<B>Important: </B> As information is added to the ATM.INI file, don't try
to install or remove fonts just by copying or erasing files. Adding or deleting
fonts must be done with the ATM Control Panel and/or the Print Manager.

<P>
For faster performance and better typeset quality don't forget to either
install these fonts as<!-- entering slot 277 --> downloadable, or download
them directly, if you are using them with a PostScript printer, which does
not have them already built-in.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
