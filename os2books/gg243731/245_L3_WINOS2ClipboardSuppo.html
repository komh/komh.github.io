<P>
The WIN-OS/2 clipboard view utility will display the captured data in a
number of formats, either predefined or private.<I> Auto</I> displays the
data in the format it had when placed onto the clipboard.
<P>
The clipboard view program CLIPWOS2.EXE, installed in C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2,
is available within each SAVDM and MAVDM by default.  This is a modified
version of the original Windows 3.0 clipboard program.
<P>
A Clipboard Server (Global Clipboard) runs as a protected mode background
process under OS/2 Version 2.0, to service clipboard functions between VDMs.
 If the Clipboard Server is not executing, clipboard functions are limited
to within a single VDM. The Clipboard Server (\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\VDMSRVR.EXE)
is automatically started with the first WIN-OS/2 VDM.
<P>
Should a user elect to exit from the Windows clipboard, a warning message
will be displayed, advising that exiting will terminate public clipboard
functions.  The clipboard functions within each VDM are public by default,
unless explicitly set to LOCAL, which restricts clipboard activity to that
WIN-OS/2 session only.
<P>
The WIN-OS/2 clipboard viewer pull-down menus have been enhanced to include
support for an<I> Options</I> menu, which contains the<I> Public Clipboard
</I>option. Selecting this option causes changes to the local clipboard
to be reflected in the public clipboard and vice versa. When deselected,
the contents of the public and local clipboards will not affect each other.

<P>
The<I> File</I> pull-down menu now supports<I> Import/Export</I> functions;
<I>Public</I> must be deselected from the<I> Options</I> pull-down menu
before<I> Import/Export</I> can be selected.
<P>
<B>Export</B> will copy the current contents of the local clipboard to the
Public clipboard.
<P>
<B>Import</B> will copy the contents of the public clipboard to the Local
clipboard.
<P>
<B>Implementation Notes: </B> The Import/Export functions communicate via
named pipes to the \pipe\CLPAgent to the clipboard program (CLIPWOS2.EXE)
within each VDM. This could cause performance problems on systems which
already utilize named pipes heavily for other purposes or when the content
of the clipboard data is too big, for example huge bitmaps.  If you don't
need to exchange clipboard data outside a MAVDM, you could keep it<I> local
</I>and therefore get around any possible performance problems.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
