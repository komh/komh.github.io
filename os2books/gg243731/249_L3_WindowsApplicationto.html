<P>
In a native Windows 3.0 environment, a Windows application (client) will
broadcast a<I> DDE Initiate</I> message. Windows serially posts a message
to every Windows application currently running and then awaits a reply.
As described above, the<I> Initiate Conversation</I> message contains the
DDE topic to which any Windows application can respond. The client application
continues execution when all other applications have serviced the message.
At this time, the client application communicates directly with the server
applications, as opposed to the initial broadcast message.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides two applications to support communications between
VDMs, without altering the Windows code:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A resident Windows application referred to as the
DDE<B> ServerAgent</B> (<B>SA</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A DOS protected mode application referred to as the
<B>DDEServer</B> (VDMSRVR.EXE).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<B>ServerAgent</B>
<P>
The Windows VDM's resident ServerAgent consists of two parts:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A "ServerAgent" which sends and receives messages
outside of the VDM<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->One or more "agents" (each agent is a child window
of the ServerAgent), which act as "clones" of applications running in other
VDMs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If either the DDEServer or the VDM's ServerAgent is not executing, DDE is
not available outside of the VDM.  The ServerAgent is automatically started
when the Windows VDM is started.  When started, DDE is in<I> public</I> mode.
 To keep it<I> local</I>, simply kill (close) the DDE Interchange Agent.
 To make it<I> public</I> again, simply start the Interchange Agent once
more.
<P>
Should the user choose to kill the DDE Interchange Agent, an information
message will be displayed indicating that DDE activity will be visible only
to the Windows applications executing in the current VDM, discontinuing
DDE communication with Presentation Manager applications and other Windows
applications.
<P>
The ServerAgent is responsible for all routing of DDE messages, including
broadcast messages beyond the confines of the VDM to the DDEServer. The
ServerAgent communicates with the DDEServer (VDMSRVR.EXE) via named pipes.

<P>
Agent applications communicate with Windows applications in their VDM and
the ServerAgent executing in their VDM. Only the ServerAgent uses named
pipes. Agents send requests to the ServerAgent to be forwarded outside of
the VDM.
<P>
<B>DDEServer (VDMSRVR.EXE)</B>
<P>
The DDEServer is responsible for routing requests from ServerAgents to the
appropriate VDMs. The DDE process is schematically represented in <A HREF="052_L2_DDEProcessbetweenWin.html">Figure
"DDE Process between Windows Environments"</A>.
<P>
The sequence of events for DDE communication between applications running
in different WIN-OS/2 VDMs is as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A DDE Initiate message is broadcast from Windows
application A.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The message is forwarded by the ServerAgent to
the DDEServer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The DDEServer forwards this message to all other
DDEAgents.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Each DDEAgent<I> broadcasts</I> this initiate
message to all Windows applications in their VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Windows application D responds  affirmatively
to this DDE initiate message.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The DDEAgent creates a child task ServerAgent
A to act as an agent to Windows application A.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The DDEAgent forwards an<I> acknowledgement</I> to
the DDEServer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The DDEServer forwards this<I> acknowledgement
</I>to the DDEAgent for the Windows application A.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->This DDEAgent creates a child task ServerAgent
D to act as an agent to Windows application D.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
10.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>The DDEAgent forwards the response from Windows
application D to the Windows application A.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
From here on, the two Windows applications communicate through this established
path.
<P>
Appl. A &lt;-&gt; DDEChildAgent D &lt;-&gt; DDEAgent A &lt;-&gt; DDEServer
&lt;-&gt; DDEAgent D &lt;-&gt; DDEChildAgent A &lt;-&gt; Appl. D.
<P>
This mechanism isolates all named pipe transactions (Steps 2, 3, 7 and 8)
to the DDEAgents and the DDEServer.  It also gives the Windows application
A the illusion of a point-to-point connection to Windows application D (because
it will actually communicate with Windows application D's child agent in
the same VDM).
<P>
The interprocess communication protocol used between the Windows applications
and the DDEAgents is the original and unmodified DDE protocol.
<P>
If two Windows applications require significant amounts of DDE, these applications
should be executed from within the same MAVDM.  In such instances, the ServerAgent
and DDEServer applications would not be required, thereby improving performance
and<!-- entering slot 286 --> usability.  Once this is done, the user need
only kill (close) the participating DDE Interchange Agent to ensure that
all DDE messaging is kept<I> local</I>.
