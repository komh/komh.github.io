OS/2 Version 2.0 provides significantly enhanced DOS application support
capability over previous versions of OS/2, using a component known as Multiple
Virtual DOS Machines.  MVDM offers many significant functions and features,
including:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Ability to run multiple DOS sessions concurrently,
with full pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

windows<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

OS/2 Version 2.0 provides DOS 5.0 compatibility within the virtual 8086
mode of the 80386 processor, and allows execution of multiple concurrent
DOS applications, each operating in its own 1MB virtual address space.  This
brings true multiprogramming to the DOS environment under OS/2.  A user
may run multiple DOS applications in much the same way as they run multiple
OS/2 applications.  DOS and OS/2 applications can be started in the same
ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->From the OS/2 START command.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The DOS environment is more DOS-compatible than the DOS Compatibility Box
implemented under previous versions of OS/2, since OS/2 Version 2.0 encapsulates
the entire DOS environment in a virtual machine.  This provides better protection
for other processes in the system and for the operating system environment
itself.  With MVDM, an errant DOS application can only "hang" its own virtual
DOS machine, which may then be terminated by the user without affecting
other applications in the system.
<P>
DOS applications may be run full-screen, windowed, or iconized in the background.
 Besides being better protected, providing better compatibility and more
concurrent DOS applications, the OS/2 Version 2.0 MVDM environment leaves
applications with more than 630KB of memory in which to execute.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also provides support for the execution of Microsoft Windows
applications (written for Windows 3.0 and/or previous versions of Windows,
except version 1.0x) to execute under the control of OS/2 Version 2.0.  Each
Windows application executes as a separate protected mode task, and is therefore
provided with the same pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection as
other protected mode tasks under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
Support for both the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) and the Extended
Memory Specification (XMS) is provided.  DOS asynchronous communications
applications can support communication speeds of up to 9600 baud.  Since
the DOS environments are swappable, starting many DOS sessions will not
increase requirements for more physical (real) memory.
<P>
The MVDM environment also provides an extendable architecture that allows
the environment to be custom tailored to emulate any DOS environment.  The
virtual device driver architecture supports this flexible environment.  All
of the low-level DOS support, which in previous versions of OS/2 resided
in physical device drivers, has been moved into virtual device drivers.
 In virtual 8086 mode, all interrupt processing is done in protected mode;
bimodal device drivers are no longer needed.  The new driver architecture
provides physical device drivers for basic device support and virtual device
drivers for supporting virtual devices to the DOS environments.  DOS settings
allow the user to tailor the functioning of DOS applications in the VDM
environment.
