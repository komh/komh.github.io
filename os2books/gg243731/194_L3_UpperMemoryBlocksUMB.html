<H1>Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs)</H1><!-- entering slot 217 -->
<P>
VXMS attempts to reserve all unreserved pages in the region of memory between
640KB and 1MB; this region is often termed the<B> Upper Memory Area</B> (<B>UMA</B>).
 The address ranges reserved in this manner will be used to simulate <A HREF="459_L2_uppermemoryblock.html"><B>Upper
Memory Blocks</B> (<B>UMBs</B>)</A>.  Note that this allocation scheme requires
that VXMS be the<I> last</I> device driver loaded; any device drivers loaded
after VXMS will not be able to reserve any addresses in the UMA.
<P>
When a UMB is not in use, its corresponding range of addresses is mapped
to a black hole.  When it is in use, the range of addresses corresponding
to the UMB being allocated is mapped to a memory object outside the V86
mode address space which is allocated for this purpose.  This is similar
to the technique used to map objects in the HMA.
<P>
VXMS uses a delayed UMB allocation scheme.  Unlike conventional XMS implementations,
no UMBs are allocated until the first UMB request.  Upon receiving the first
UMB request, VXMS queries the UMB region to determine which address ranges
are available, and reserves those ranges.  This technique supports memory
mapped devices which lie in the same region from which UMBs are taken.  Advanced
users can use<I> Include/Exclude Regions</I> in the DOS Settings feature
to tell VXMS which ranges are not to be used.
<P>
Note that by default, all UMBs are<I> owned</I> by the DOS Emulation kernel
and are<I> not</I> available for application use.  If an application wishes
to use UMBs, the DOS = NOUMB statement must be included in CONFIG.SYS or
the application can't get any UMB because they are already used by DOS.
Alternatively, the ownership of UMBs for a single VDM may be enabled or
disabled using the<I> DOS owns UMBs</I> setting; see <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS
Settings</A>.
<P>
VXMS allows coexistence with EMS services, in that it queries VEMM before
reserving address ranges, so that VEMM may reserve the space it requires
for its frame.  As such, it is possible that an application using both EMS
and XMS services will execute and function correctly.
<P>
<B>DOS Device Drivers</B>
<P>
DOS device drivers may be loaded into UMBs, thereby conserving memory within
the 640KB DOS application space; this support is functionally compatible
with that provided by DOS 5.0.  Loading a DOS device driver into a UMB requires
a number of additional statements in CONFIG.SYS; an example is given in
<A HREF="036_L2_CONFIGSYSLoadingDevi.html">Figure "CONFIG.SYS - Loading
Device Drivers into UMBs"</A>.
<P>
The first statement causes the VXMS virtual device driver VXMS.SYS to be
loaded at initialization time.  The second statement causes the ANSI.SYS
device driver to be loaded into a UMB.  The SIZE parameter ensures that
the device driver is loaded into a UMB of the required size for its operation;
 if a UMB of this size cannot be allocated, the device driver is automatically
loaded into low memory.
<P>
For DOS device drivers loaded into a specific VDM using<I> DOS Device Drivers
</I>in the DOS Settings feature, the SIZE parameter is also supported. Specifying
a SIZE parameter in DOS Settings will cause the device driver to be loaded
into a UMB if possible; if UMBs are not present or if a sufficiently large
UMB cannot be allocated, the device driver will be loaded into low memory.

<P>
Note that device drivers are always loaded into the largest available UMB;
hence, in order to achieve efficiency in the utilization of UMBs, device
drivers should be loaded in order of size, from largest to smallest.  This
is achieved by placing the DEVICE= statements in CONFIG.SYS, or names of
the device drivers in the<I> DOS Device Drivers</I> setting, in that order.

<P>
The third statement allocates ownership of UMBs to the DOS kernel, and prevents
applications from accessing UMBs.  This statement sets the default for all
VDMs; if an application running in a VDM requires UMBs, the default may
be overridden for that VDM using the appropriate DOS Settings function.

<P>
Note that some device drivers may not function correctly in a UMB if they
rely on having all memory above them available for their use.  If<!-- entering slot 218 --> incorrect
operation of a device driver is experienced in a UMB, the value of the SIZE
parameter should be increased by modifying the DEVICEHIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS
or by altering the appropriate DOS settings for the VDM.
<P>
<B>TSR Programs</B>
<P>
TSR programs may also be loaded into UMBs in order to conserve DOS application
space.  TSR programs such as APPEND, which are loaded by default when a
VDM is started, are loaded into a UMB where possible, thereby saving approximately
6KB of memory.  Loading a TSR program into a UMB is performed from the DOS
command line or from a batch file using the LOADHIGH command, as shown in
<A HREF="037_L2_LOADHIGHCommandLoadi.html">Figure "LOADHIGH Command - Loading
TSRs into UMBs"</A>.
<P>
Note that parameters for TSR programs are supported by the LOADHIGH command.

<P>
TSR programs which rely on having all memory above their location available
for their use may not execute correctly when loaded in a UMB.  In such cases,
the TSR must be loaded into low memory.
