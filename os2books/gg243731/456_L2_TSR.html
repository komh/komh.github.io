TSR
<P>
Terminate and Stay Resident; term used to describe DOS applications which
modify interrupt vectors to insert their own interrupt processing code.
 This technique is used frequently by low-level utility programs, device
drivers and other system code such as network drivers.  TSR programs use
memory within the DOS address space, thus leaving less memory available
for application use.
