<H1>Standard Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 239 -->
<P>
<B>Standard Mode: </B> The normal operating mode for running Windows. This
mode provides access to extended memory and also lets you switch among non-Windows
applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
<A HREF="452_L2_standardmode.html"><B>Standard mode</B></A> uses the 80286
processor's protected mode to provide direct access for Windows and Windows
applications to up to 16MB of extended memory. Expanded memory for DOS applications
is only supported with physical expanded memory cards (emulation of expanded
memory using extended memory is not supported).
<P>
Standard mode requires an 80286 processor or above, and at least 1MB of
installed memory, with a minimum 192KB of free extended memory.  The XMS
driver HIMEM.SYS must also be loaded.  Windows applications must be written
to comply with the memory management rules for Windows 3.0 in order to run
in standard mode.
<P>
Standard mode is recommended by Microsoft when running only Windows applications
(that is, no DOS applications) in certain configurations, even on an 80386
machine. In the Windows 3.0 manual, on page 429, it is suggested that users
running only Windows 3.0 applications should run in standard mode, even
on 80386 systems with 2-3MB of memory, as there is a performance improvement
in doing so.
<P>
Standard mode is necessary for some Windows applications (for example, Microsoft
Excel** Version 3.0). To accommodate such applications, OS/2 Version 2.0
must provide additional support.  Basically, these applications need to
access DPMI services for extended memory support, which is available under
Windows 3.0 when running in standard or enhanced modes.  See <A HREF="255_L1_DOSProtectedModeInte.html">DOS
Protected Mode Interface</A> for further information on DPMI support under
OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
The other requirement is to supply Windows services to Windows applications.
This service is provided in OS/2 Version 2.0 by modifying the Windows kernel
and running it in standard mode in a VDM. As part of the joint development
and cross-licensing agreement between IBM and Microsoft, IBM has access
to the Windows source code. IBM has modified the source to provide a Windows
kernel (WIN-OS/2)  capable of running as a DPMI client within a VDM (the
retail version of Windows 3.0 can<I> only</I> function as a DPMI host),
and includes this kernel as part of the OS/2 Version 2.0 product.
<P>
OS/2 therefore supports Windows applications running in standard mode in
a VDM.  Use of the VDM design, which provides a self-contained DOS environment,
means that the environment is identical, from the application's point of
view, to running under Windows loaded in standard mode, on DOS. This design
therefore provides the maximum compatibility with the DOS/Windows environment.
In fact, it offers a wider range of compatibility, since Windows 2.x applications,
which require real mode operation under Windows 3.0 in DOS, can be run concurrently
with Windows 3.0 applications running in standard mode.  This combination
is not possible at the same time under DOS/Windows 3.0.
