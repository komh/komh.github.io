<H1>Booting from a DOS Partition</H1><!-- entering slot 360 -->
<P>
If VMB will be used regularly, the most convenient method may be to do so
from a DOS partition on hard disk, rather than via diskettes or diskette
images.  This may be achieved by specifying<I> C:</I> as the value for<I> DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE
</I>under DOS Settings. Loading DOS from a DOS partition proceeds more quickly
and offers the user a more "familiar" working environment. It is also easier
to apply DOS Corrective Service to a disk partition than to diskettes or
images.
<P>
Note that this method is different from that of a single hard disk partition
with the Dual Boot feature available under previous versions of OS/2.
<P>
In order to load DOS from a DOS partition, the following requirements must
be satisfied:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Boot Manager must be installed<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->DOS must be installed on a primary partition
on the first hard disk in the machine<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->OS/2 Version 2.0 must be installed on an extended
partition on the first fixed disk, or on another hard disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This will require re-partitioning on single-drive systems if the disk initially
contains DOS alone, or earlier versions of OS/2.
<P>
Loading DOS from a DOS partition presents one significant problem.  The
DOS partition is itself bootable directly via Boot Manager, should the user
so choose, and there may a requirement to boot this DOS partition directly
on occasions.  OS/2 Version 2.0 provides stub device drivers for functions
such as EMS, XMS and mouse support in the VMB session, and these must be
used in place of the normal DOS device drivers when DOS is booted in a VMB
session. Since the same CONFIG.SYS  and AUTOEXEC.BAT in the C: root directory
is used, the question arises of which drivers should be specified for functions
such as EMS and XMS support:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the partition is booted via VMB, the DOS drivers
are inappropriate<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the partition is booted directly via Boot Manager,
the OS/2 stub drivers are inappropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
It might appear that the user would have to maintain multiple configuration
files and rename or copy them depending upon whether the partition was being
booted into a VMB session or directly from Boot Manager.  This is clearly
unsatisfactory. Fortunately there is a solution which avoids this. The key
is to specify<I> both</I> sets of drivers, in the correct order, in CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT.
<P>
The following example assumes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->DOS 5.0 is installed on the C: Primary partition<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->OS/2 Version 2.0 is installed on the E: Extended partition
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
CONFIG.SYS on the C: drive contains:
<PRE>device=c:\dos\setver.exe
device=c:\dos\himem.sys
device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems
device=e:\os2\mdos\himem.sys
device=e:\os2\mdos\emm386.sys
dos=high,umb
   ... etc ...
</PRE>

<P>
When this file is processed in an OS/2 VMB session, the DOS HIMEM load fails
as it sees no available extended memory. EMM386.EXE cannot load as it sees
protect-mode software already running. Then, the OS/2 HIMEM and EMM386 stub
device drivers load as normal.
<P>
When this file is processed as part of a native DOS boot, the DOS HIMEM
and EMM386 load as normal, but the OS/2 stub device drivers detect that
they are not running under OS/2 and do not load themselves.
<P>
A similar technique works for mouse support in AUTOEXEC.BAT:
<PRE>@echo off
prompt $p$g
set path=c:\dos
LH e:\os2\mdos\mouse
LH c:\dos\mouse
   ... etc ...
</PRE>

<P>
Note that<!-- entering slot 361 --> here the OS/2 driver is listed first.
When this file is processed in an OS/2 VMB session, the OS/2 stub loads
first.  The DOS mouse driver sees that a mouse driver is already present,
and hence it does not install itself.  When booting DOS natively, the OS/2
mouse stub device driver detects that it is not running under OS/2, and
does not load itself. The DOS mouse driver then loads as normal.
