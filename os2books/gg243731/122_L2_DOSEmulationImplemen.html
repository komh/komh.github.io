<H1>DOS Emulation Implementation</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
A primary design goal for MVDM and the DOS Emulation component was to provide
a DOS compatible environment in which a VDM could not negatively affect
other VDMs or OS/2 protected mode processes, while at the same time providing
the greatest amount of free memory for DOS applications. This goal was achieved
by allowing as much of the DOS Emulation  code as possible to execute in
protected mode, outside the VDM  address space. This provides improved protection,
leaves more memory available for DOS application use, and enhances overall
performance.
