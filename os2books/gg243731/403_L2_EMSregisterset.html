EMS register set
<P>
EMS memory mapping is accomplished by a set of registers, one for each mappable
physical page.  A register specifies the current associated logical page.
 Registers can be unmapped.  EMS optionally offers multiple<I> alternate
register sets</I> and<I> DMA register sets</I>.  A register set is, in essence,
a page table for mappable windows.  Alternate register sets then, are multiple
page tables, only one of which is active at any given time.
