OS/2 Version 2.0 provides device drivers to handle the interface between
the operating system and the hardware.  Physical device drivers are used
by normal protected mode processes running OS/2 applications, while virtual
device drivers are used by DOS applications running in virtual DOS machines.

<P>
Virtual device drivers provide a means of representing hardware devices
to a DOS application in a virtual DOS machine, such that the devices appear
to the application as though the application had sole control over the device.
 In this way, MVDM allows DOS applications to issue instructions which directly
manipulate hardware devices or the DOS system environment, while maintaining
full protection of other applications in the system.  Virtual device drivers
typically access hardware by requesting services from physical device drivers.

<P>
Virtual device drivers are used not only for shared hardware devices, but
also for other aspects of the machine environment, such as BIOS, CMOS, and
the (physical) programmable interrupt controller.  Through the use of virtual
device drivers for these components, DOS applications may freely access
and manipulate them without affecting other DOS applications or OS/2 applications
in the system.
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a number of standard virtual device drivers for
the DOS system environment and common hardware devices.  Hardware vendors
may develop virtual device drivers for their own hardware adapters.  Note
that if a hardware device will be dedicated to one application (that is,
sharing of the hardware is not required) then a virtual device driver is
not needed; the normal DOS device driver will allow the application to access
the hardware device as in a native DOS environment.
<P>
A virtual device driver operates at privilege level 0, and therefore cannot
access operating system services via the normal application programming
interfaces provided by OS/2 Version 2.0.  Instead, a set of virtual device
helper services is provided to enable virtual device drivers to access system
services.  Virtual device drivers may be written in a high-level language
such as "C".
