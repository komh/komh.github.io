<P>
Communication between processes is valuable in a multitasking operating
system to enable concurrent processes to work together.  Pipes are one of
three forms within OS/2 of interprocess communication (IPC) and the only
form available for IPC from a DOS application running in a VDM to an OS/2
application.
<P>
This chapter describes how to create, manage, and use named pipes for IPC
of a DOS application in a VDM to an OS/2 program. Pipes enable two or more
processes to communicate as if they were reading from and writing to a file.
