<H1>Preparing AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS</H1><!-- entering slot 353 -->
<P>
The AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS that will be used by the VMB at initialization
are not the ones found in the root directory of the OS/2 V2.0 boot drive.
<A HREF="077_L2_LocationofAUTOEXECBA.html">Table "Location of AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS"</A> explains which AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS will be used
for the different DOS session types under OS/2 V2.0.
<P>
CONFIG.SYS requires special attention for the following reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Write access to the hard disk is denied the Virtual
Machine Boot session to preserve system integrity, since the real DOS is
unaware of OS/2 V2.0 and the other applications running.
<P>
The OS/2 device driver FSFILTER.SYS is provided to address the above problem.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->HPFS partitions are not visible to the real DOS
running.
<P>
FSFILTER.SYS allows the DOS in the Virtual Machine Boot to access HPFS files.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->OS/2 V2.0 provides its own mouse, EMS and XMS
to each virtual DOS machine, so there is no need to load the equivalent
drivers available for native DOS. Those provided with the real DOS should
not be used.
<P>
However, some DOS programs test for the presence of these drivers. OS/2
V2.0 provides the equivalent "stub" drivers to satisfy these programs that
the services actually are available.
<P>
The following types of device drivers should also be omitted from CONFIG.SYS:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Disk cache<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Print spooler<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->RAM disk<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
These facilities are already provided by OS/2 Version 2.0 and may be accessed
by virtual DOS machines and VMB sessions; including them with DOS leads
to unnecessary duplication, and may impact overall performance.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
When the Virtual Machine Boot is started from a diskette image on the hard
disk, the real DOS sees the diskette image as drive A:. The real drive A:
cannot be accessed. OS/2 V2.0 provides a DOS program, FSACCESS.EXE, that
can be used from the DOS command prompt or inserted in AUTOEXEC.BAT to overcome
this problem.
<P>
We will cover each of these special requirements in detail in the following
sections.
<P>
<B>Drive Letter Allocation and Access</B>
<P>
Drive letter allocation and access is one of the more complex areas of VMB,
mainly due to the automatic drive letter allocation performed by DOS, and
the limitations of earlier DOS versions. The following possible areas of
confusion may arise for the user:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If DOS is booted from an image file, it sees this
image file as its A: drive. This prevents access to the<I> real</I> A:  diskette
drive. Attempts to write to the apparent A: drive will fail.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Unlike the DOS Emulation kernel provided by OS/2 Version
2.0, the "real" DOS booted by VMB cannot see or access an HPFS partition
on the hard disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A DOS 3.x VDM cannot see a large (&gt;32MB) FAT partition
on the fixed disk, or FAT partitions beyond an HPFS partition on the disk.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Even if the booted DOS can otherwise see the hard
disk partition, it is only given read access. Attempts to write will fail
with simulated errors such as General failure writing drive C:". The user
might mistake this for a genuine hardware fault.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the booted DOS loads a block device-driver, the
allocated drive letter may be the same as that of a different device outside
this VDM, thereby preventing access to that device from within the VDM.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
The results could be somewhat disorienting for the user. To help resolve
these<!-- entering slot 354 --> issues, two utilities<B> FSFILTER</B> and
<B>FSACCESS</B> are provided with OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
It is recommended that disk volumes should always be given a meaningful
name, either when formatting or later using the LABEL command. This name
will remain constant regardless of drive letter allocation, and will aid
in identifying a particular volume, even if the assigned drive letter is
different.<B> FSFILTER</B>
<P>
FSFILTER.SYS is a device driver which manages DOS VDM access to OS/2 disks.
FSFILTER.SYS should be copied from the \OS2\MDOS directory to the DOS diskette,
and the following statement added to the CONFIG.SYS file of the bootable
DOS diskette or image.
<PRE>device=a:fsfilter.sys
</PRE>

<P>
This statement should precede any DEVICE= statements which load block device
drivers.
<P>
Note that FSFILTER.SYS gives DOS full access to all OS/2 partitions, regardless
of their file system type or partition size.
<P>
This is an important and somewhat surprising point. For example, DOS 3.3
(in a VDM) has no problem accessing a 300MB HPFS partition, once FSFILTER
is loaded. I/O calls within the DOS virtual machine are passed transparently
to OS/2 Version 2.0. DOS itself is unaware of the underlying file system.
DOS can read, write and modify files on the hard disk, and for most configurations
the drive letter mapping within the VMB session will match those of OS/2
Version 2.0.
<P>
The FSFILTER device driver occupies approximately 11KB of memory.  It can
be loaded into high memory under DOS 5.0 by specifying the command DEVICEHIGH
= FSFILTER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
The users should also specify the path to COMMAND.COM in the SHELL= statement
of CONFIG.SYS.  For example, if DOS files have been copied to C:\DOS, the
CONFIG.SYS file on a diskette intended for VMB should contain the following
statement:
<PRE>SHELL=c:\DOS\COMMAND.COM c:\dos /p
</PRE>

<P>
The first parameter specifies the command processor to be loaded. The second
parameter specifies the reload path (that is, the COMSPEC path). This is
preferable to a SET COMSPEC = command in AUTOEXEC.BAT.
<P>
Each block device driver loaded in DOS CONFIG.SYS is allocated the next
free OS/2 letter<I> excluding LAN drives</I>.  This can result in a drive
letter clash.  An example may illustrate the point. OS/2 drives are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>A:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Diskette drive 0<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>B:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Diskette drive 1<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>C:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Hard disk<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>D:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> External diskette drive<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>E:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Remote LAN drive on a server<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
FSFILTER will ensure that a booted DOS sees these drives by the same letter.
The booted DOS has the same access to the external diskette drive and LAN
resources as does OS/2 itself. This is true whether the VMB session is started
before or after user logon to the network, when remote drive letters are
assigned.
<P>
However, a block device driver in a VMB session will also initialize as
E:, so LAN drive access is lost. To remedy this, issue an "fsaccess f=e"
command. The LAN drive is now accessible as F:  within the DOS session.

<P>
Note that even when FSFILTER is loaded, the following restrictions still
apply:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A VMB session cannot<!-- entering slot 355 --> see
HPFS files or directories which have:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Long file names (9 or more characters)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Invalid
FAT characters (for example, plus, comma, blank)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Multiple dot separators.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>HPFS
file names containing lowercase letters are folded to uppercase.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>PC
DOS commands which require low-level disk access will fail.  These include:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->CHKDSK<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>SYS
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>UNDELETE<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>FORMAT<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>UNFORMAT<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>MIRROR.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> In such cases
OS/2 Version 2.0 will simulate a disk error condition. DOS may interpret
this as a hardware fault, or report that the command is not supported on
a network or assigned drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>FSACCESS</B>
<P>
FSACCESS.EXE is a utility supplied with OS/2 Version 2.0 but intended to
run in a VMB session. It cooperates with FSFILTER to manage drive letters
within the VMB session. This serves three purposes:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Drives may be registered for filtering.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The drive letter for a device can be changed,
giving consistency across sessions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Letters can be removed in order to hide the OS/2
device from the VMB session.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
The syntax of the FSACCESS command is:
<PRE>FSACCESS ────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────┐
                         ├─┬───┬─ DOSletter ───────┘     │
                         │ └ ! ┘                         │
                         ├────── DOSletter - DOSletter ──┤
                         │                               │
                         └────── DOSletter = OS2drive  ──┘
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
FSACCESS<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Lists the current drive mapping. For example:

<PRE>             Local C: is mapped to OS/2 C:
             Local D: is mapped to OS/2 D:
             Local E: is mapped to OS/2 K:</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>FSACCESS F:<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Registers DOS
letter F: for filtering. References to F:  will be sent to OS/2 Version
2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> FSACCESS !F:<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> De-registers
DOS letter F: from filtering.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> FSACCESS F:-H:<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Registers
DOS letters F: through H: for filtering.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> FSACCESS
M:=C:<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Routes requests for DOS letter M: to OS/2
drive C:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Parameters can be combined on a single command line, and the colon is optional.

<P>
When booting from an image file, it is often desirable to issue the command
<I>FSACCESS A:</I> in order to access the A:  diskette drive.  This will
remove access to the image file, so the booted DOS will be unable to reload
its COMMAND.COM when necessary.  It may be useful to copy all the DOS files
to a subdirectory on hard disk, ensuring the PATH and COMSPEC point there.

<P>
An alternative is to access the diskette drive via a different letter. For
example, a user may issue the command<I> FSACCESS G:=A</I>, then use G:
to access the real A:  drive.  The image file remains as A:, avoiding PATH
and COMSPEC problems.
