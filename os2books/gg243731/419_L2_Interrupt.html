Interrupt
<P>
An electrical signal generated by a device or adapter within the system,
to inform the operating system that an event, such as the completion of
an I/O operation, has occurred.  The operating system then processes the
interrupt by passing control to a particular piece of code which handles
the appropriate action in response to the event indicated.
