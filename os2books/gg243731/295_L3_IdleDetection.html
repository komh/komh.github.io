<H1>Idle Detection</H1><!-- entering slot 338 -->
<P>
The following settings determine the way in which the operating system detects
that an application in a VDM is currently idle.  These settings should be
used when an application exhibits poor performance, or where mouse movement
in a DOS application is "jerky".
<P>
<B>IDLE_SECONDS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> When programs appear to be doing
nothing but waiting for input, the operating system gives them less time
to run. This is done to give preference to programs that are doing useful
work.  Some programs periodically appear to be waiting for input, but then
change their behavior and continue after a time.  This setting disables
the "IDLE_SENSITIVITY" function for a period of time after useful work has
been detected.
<P>
Also see IDLE_SENSITIVITY below for more details on idle detection.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>If a program appears to run slowly when there
is an option for the user to provide input, this value should be increased.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL> Setting
the value too high gives the DOS program more resources than it needs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>This value is in seconds.  The default is no
idle time allowed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL> The
setting can be changed while the program is running to tune it to the proper
value.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>When
DOS 5 is run in a virtual machine boot session, (See <A HREF="304_L1_VirtualMachineBoot.html">Virtual
Machine Boot</A>) the DOS shell may fail to complete displaying the directory

<B>IDLE_SENSITIVITY</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> The idle sensitivity level sets
a threshold for judging when applications will be considered idle.  The
value is the percentage of the maximum possible polling rate the application
can perform.  If an application polls at a rate higher than this value,
it is considered "idle".
<P>
DOS programs often "poll" for input when they are waiting for a user response.
 For instance, a program may wait for a response by repeatedly checking
to see if the user has hit a key.  In a multitasking environment such as
OS/2 Version 2.0, this wastes time when other programs could be running
instead.  The operating system detects idle programs by looking for a high
rate of polling for input.  When programs are judged to be waiting for input,
they are given less time to run.
<P>
For example, if idle sensitivity is set to 75%, then an application repeatedly
checking to see if input is available would have to do this checking at
more than 75% of the maximum possible rate before it would be judged idle.

<P>
Idle detection is a "best guess" of what the program is doing.  It could
be that the program is polling at a very high rate, but is still doing useful
work in between checking.  It may be that the application checks at a fairly
slow rate but still is doing nothing but waiting. The idle sensitivity threshold
allows adjustment of the threshold for a particular application.
<P>
Also see IDLE_SECONDS above.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> If
an application receives input while running and seems to run slower than
expected, the idle sensitivity should be set to a higher value.  This lets
the application poll at a higher rate without being judged idle.  Setting
the level to 100 turns idle detection off altogether.  The application will
be allowed to poll for input as often as it likes.
<P>
If an application is waiting for input and other applications do not appear
to be running, the idle sensitivity should be adjusted downward.  This lowers
the threshold for judging the application idle.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>Overall system performance can usually be improved
when there are multiple DOS applications running if<I> IDLE_SENSITIVITY
</I>is turned down.
