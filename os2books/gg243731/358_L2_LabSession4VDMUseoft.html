<H1>Lab Session 4: VDM Use of the Speaker</H1><!-- entering slot 413 -->
<P>
In this exercise, you will be asked to run multiple sessions of a DOS application
that accesses the speaker system.  The provided SOUND.EXE program plays
music.  Note the behavior of the system's sessions in view of the fact that
the speaker is a piece of hardware which is not virtualized.
