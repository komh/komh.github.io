<H1>DPMI and Microsoft Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
DPMI 0.9 support is necessary for Windows 3.0 to run applications in protected
mode (that is, in Windows standard mode).  With DPMI implemented in Windows
3.0, Windows 3.0 applications (running in protected mode) are freed from
the restrictive 640KB DOS address space.
<P>
Windows 3.0 is<I> not</I> a standard DPMI client and cannot run under DPMI
in a VDM without completely subverting the operating system's memory protection
and thereby potentially compromising system integrity.
<P>
Even with DPMI, Windows cannot run in 386 enhanced mode under OS/2 Version
2.0.  The reason for this is that when Windows runs in enhanced mode it
operates at Ring 0.  Running Windows in 386 enhanced mode would therefore
require bypassing the operating system's protection mechanisms, and would
potentially compromise the integrity of the system.
