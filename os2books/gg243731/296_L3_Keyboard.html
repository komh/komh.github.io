<P>
The following settings affect the behavior of the keyboard and the interpretation
of control key sequences issued within a VDM.
<P>
<B>KBD_ALTHOME_BYPASS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> When enabled, prevents the Alt+Home
key sequence from switching the VDM between full screen and windowed mode.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Enabling
this setting allows normal behavior for applications which themselves make
use of the Alt+Home key sequence.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>When enabled, the user must use the Ctrl+Esc
sequence to switch to Presentation Manager from a full screen VDM, then
use the context menu of the class to switch the VDM to windowed mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Off (Alt+Home will cause a switch between full
screen and windowed mode).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>KBD_BUFFER_EXTEND</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Increases a VDM's keyboard type-ahead
buffer size.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Provides
greater keystroke buffering, consistent with the level available in VIO
windows.  Note that Ctrl-Break will flush the entire buffer, just as it
does with the standard buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Applications
which bypass the ROM BIOS input buffer and/or INT 16h may not benefit from
this feature.  There is also a small amount of additional memory overhead
for every VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> On.
 Most applications will benefit, and those that do not should not be adversely
affected.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.  This facilitates easy experimentation by the user in the (rare)
event that a problem does arise.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>KBD_CTRL_BYPASS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> When enabled, inhibits one or
more control key sequences, allowing an application in the VDM to use these
sequences for its own purposes.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Enabling
this setting allows normal behavior for applications which make use of control
key sequences normally used by OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Enabling this setting may prevent certain operations
from being performed with OS/2 Version 2.0 and the Workplace Shell.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>NONE (All control key sequences behave in the
normal manner).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>KBD_RATE_LOCK</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Prevents a DOS application in
a VDM from changing the system keyboard repeat rate.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Insulates machine from applications that modify
the repeat rate in an uncontrolled or undesirable way.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Drawbacks:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Prevents the application's repeat rate from
taking effect even when the application is the focus session.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>Off.  Most applications do not modify the repeat
rate, and those that do are generally in accordance with the user's wishes.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> Examples:<!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> None.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
