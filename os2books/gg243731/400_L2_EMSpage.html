EMS page

Memory is allocated by EMS in page sized units; the standard page size is
16KB.  Optionally, an implementation can also offer "raw" pages at whatever
size is convenient, although 16KB pages must always be supported.  The raw
page size can be set to 16KB to provide only a single page size.
