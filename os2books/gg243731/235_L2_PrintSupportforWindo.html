<P>
The installation procedure will update the new WIN.INI file to include the
printer device driver details required by Windows for printers selected
under OS/2.  Installation selects a Windows printer device driver comparable
with the OS/2 printer device driver for that printer. The Windows printer
device driver will initially operate in its default mode. If the printer
device driver must be configured in a mode other than the default mode,
the printer should be configured from within the Windows Control Panel.

<P>
If there is no equivalent OS/2 printer device driver, the Windows device
driver should be installed and configured via the Windows Control panel.
The user should also use a printer port which is associated with the IBMNULL.DRV
PM printer device driver on the OS/2 side.  This will ensure the print data
is passed straight through the port without OS/2's print subsystem modifying
anything within the data stream.  Even the usual "printer reset" should
not occur.
