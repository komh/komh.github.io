<H1>Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)</H1><!-- entering slot 391 -->
<P>
The expanded memory specification (EMS) was initially developed by two companies,
Lotus and Intel.  Microsoft later joined the consortium, and the specification
has since become known as LIM EMS.
<P>
A number of versions of the EMS specification have been produced.  LIM EMS
Version 3.0 required a 64KB window anywhere in the area between 640KB and
1MB, and provided up to 8MB of expanded memory.  As more hardware adapters
with their own ROM were installed, it was often difficult to find a free
64KB contiguous memory area for the mappable window.
<P>
A revised version of the EMS specification has been produced, known as LIM
EMS Version 4.0.  This version allows DOS applications to allocate and access
up to 32MB of expanded memory in up to 255 expanded memory objects. Regions
of these objects can be mapped into the 8086 address space (below 1MB) allowing
DOS applications to access large address spaces at the cost of having to
explicitly remap the memory that is to be accessed.  Alternate page tables
for quick switches among mappings, function calls with remapping, and numerous
ways to save and update mappings or move or exchange memory contents are
provided.
