<H1>VDM Address Space Management</H1><!-- entering slot 103 -->
<P>
At initialization, each VDM has a linear address space of 4MB, because a
single page table is assigned for each VDM. The page table itself is a single
4KB page, and can hold a maximum of 1024 page table entries. Each of these
entries is a doubleword and points to a page with a size of 4KB, hence the
4MB size of the initial address space. The size of the address space can
be expanded beyond 4MB if required; for instance, an application running
in the VDM may request the allocation of a large amount of expanded memory,
in which case the VDMM will allocate the memory as needed.
<P>
Note that when memory is allocated OS/2 V2.0 merely reserves a linear address
range. The range is not backed by physical memory until the memory is<I> committed</I>.
Memory  may not actually be committed until a later time, and it may be
committed in portions. Allocation without commitment does not use any physical
memory and therefore does not waste resources.
<P>
A typical VDM address space map is shown in <A HREF="013_L2_TypicalVDMAddressSpa.html">Figure
"Typical VDM Address Space Map"</A>.
<P>
Each VDM task executes in the first megabyte of the linear address space,
thereby allowing the physical addresses used within the DOS applications
to be mapped directly to the process address space of the VDM. DOS system
areas such as the ROM BIOS area and the Interrupt Vector table, are mapped
from physical memory into the VDM's address space by the virtual device
driver VBIOS.SYS.
<P>
Page 0 contains, for example, the ROM BIOS area, the Interrupt Vector table,
and the DOS communication area. ROM areas used by hardware devices are mapped
by the virtual device drivers into the linear address space of the VDM.
The same applies to other linear memory objects, such as EMS objects and
display memory.
<P>
A virtual device driver uses the<B> VDHQueryFreePages()</B> device helper
service to find a region where no memory in the linear address space has
been allocated or mapped. If a free region is found, the<B> VDHReservePages()
</B>service is used to reserve the memory region. Mapping cannot take place
where memory has already been allocated. On the other hand, memory may not
be allocated where mappings already exist. The operating system's memory
manager takes care of this. Page faults are generated if a process attempts
to access memory which has previously been invalidated because it was unmapped,
or if the page has been swapped out to disk.
<P>
The 64KB memory area above 1MB (also known as the <A HREF="415_L2_highmemoryarea.html"><B>high
memory area</B></A>) must be treated in a special way. This is described
in further detail in <A HREF="118_L2_A20LineServices64KBW.html">A20 Line
Service (64KB Wraparound)</A> and in <A HREF="193_L3_HighMemoryAreaHMA.html">High
Memory Area (HMA)</A>.
