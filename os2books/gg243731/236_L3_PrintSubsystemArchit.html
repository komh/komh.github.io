<H1>Print Subsystem Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 269 -->
<P>
There are some interesting and significant changes to the OS/2 print subsystem
architecture which are used to support Windows applications, and which are
worth noting:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The print subsystem has been expanded to provide printing
support for Windows applications running on WIN-OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The OS/2 file system now intercepts ALL print jobs
routed to an LPTx port, even those directed to WIN-OS/2 LPT1 to LPT3 and
WIN-OS/2 LPT1.OS2 to LPT2.OS2 ports, and routes them to the OS/2 spooler.
Jobs routed to a COM port are not intercepted by the file system and can
proceed directly to the physical port via the serial port device driver.

<P>
<A HREF="048_L2_DetailedViewoftheWIN.html">Figure "Detailed View of the
WIN-OS/2 Data Connections"</A> shows the WIN-OS/2 details of the print subsystem
architecture in more detail.  The interesting feature to note here is that
a second spooler is present; that is, the WIN-OS/2 spooler. The WIN-OS/2
spooler is the OS/2 V2.0 implementation of the Windows spooler. Similarly,
the WIN-OS/2 Print Manager and WIN-OS/2 Control Panel represent the OS/2
V2.0 implementation of the Windows Print Manager and Windows Control Panel.
There are minor user changes apparent in the WIN-OS/2 Control Panel, but
these provide extra function rather than take it away.
<P>
For WIN-OS/2 printing, raw print data is generated via the WIN-OS/2 printer
driver and GDI (Graphical Device Interface).  The WIN-OS/2 printer driver
directs the data to the appropriate port but the data route then taken varies
depending on whether or not the OS/2 spooler is enabled, as shown in <A HREF="049_L2_LowLevelViewoftheWIN.html">Figure
"Low Level View of the WIN-OS/2 Printing Data Flow"</A>.
<P>
If the OS/2 spooler is enabled, an INT21 is issued which provides a direct
path for the print data to come into the OS/2 V2.0 file system.  Jobs directed
to LPTx or LPTx.OS2 ports are intercepted by the file system and are sent
on to the SplQmxxx interface. The print data is then processed by the print
subsystem as though it was raw data arriving from a PM queued application.
Note that for this scenario, the print data is processed by the WIN-OS/2
printer driver and also part 2 of the equivalent OS/2 printer driver.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> It is important to ensure that the WIN-OS/2 and OS/2 printer
drivers match to avoid conflict between them. If you use a WIN-OS/2 driver
which has no OS/2 equivalent then use the IBMNULL driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
Print jobs directed to COMx ports are not intercepted by the file system
as for LPTx/LPTx.OS2 ports. Instead, they are passed directly to the serial
 kernel device driver.
<P>
If the OS/2 spooler is disabled, the print data bypasses many of the print
subsystem components.  In this scenario, the WIN-OS/2 spooler will be called
upon to spool the print job, which is actually written to the root directory
of the fixed disk.  The queued spool files are distinguished by having the
file extension .TMP. If the WIN-OS/2 spooler is also disabled then the print
job passes straight through.
<P>
With the OS/2 spooler disabled, there are three routes that print jobs can
take, according to their port destination:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->When it is the turn of a COMx job to be printed,
the WIN-OS/2 spooler passes the print job to the COM VDD (Virtual Device
Driver). The reason for this is that the job will ultimately be printed
through the OS/2 serial KDD (Kernel Device Driver) which is COM.SYS. A VDD
cannot call upon physical device drivers, such as COM.SYS, directly.  Instead
it must call on the services of the VDH (Virtual Device Helper) which is
a programming interface that is able to do this on behalf of the VDD.  Consequently,
the VDD passes the print data to the serial KDD via the VDH.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> If you are printing to a COMx port, the WIN-OS/2 printer
device driver needs to initialize that port and know about the handshaking
protocol. To<!-- entering slot 270 --> specify the correct settings, you
will have to use the WIN-OS/2 Control Panel and click on the<I> Ports</I> icon.

<P>
You should also make sure that you have installed the matching PM printer
device driver under the Workplace Shell. If you don't have a matching version,
use the IBMNULL printer device driver. This printer object needs to be assigned
to the same COMx port and the<I> settings</I> must match the settings on
the WIN-OS/2 side as well as the current printer setup.
<P>
If you don't do that, the printing result will be unpredictable, especially
for large and complex print jobs.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Jobs directed to LPTx
are routed to the parallel physical device driver, PRINT0x.SYS.SYS, via
INT21.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Jobs sent to LPTx.OS2 are routed directly to
the parallel physical device driver from the WIN-OS/2 spooler.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation: </B> It is strongly recommended that users operate the
print subsystem with both spoolers enabled. Otherwise, print data from different
jobs may become mixed up, and individual applications may have to wait until
printing is completed before resuming execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
