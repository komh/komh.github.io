<P>
DOS and Windows application installation under OS/2 V2.0 is generally performed
from a DOS command prompt or from the WIN-OS/2 Program Manager. In some
cases, it may be necessary to boot from a DOS diskette to perform the install.
Modifications made to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT by installation programs
should be carefully reviewed.
<P>
If the OS/2 V2.0 system is to be set up for Boot Manager or dual boot to
DOS, the arrangement of the hard disk partitions needs to be planned.
<P>
The Migrate Applications program is used to migrate already installed DOS,
Windows, and OS/2 programs, and creates and places the program objects in
a folder on the desktop. If the DOS or Windows program is in the migrate
database<I> \OS2\INSTALL\DATABASE.DAT</I>, the Migrate Applications program
automatically selects the recommended DOS settings for the program.
<P>
The Migrate Applications program always sets up Windows programs to run
in a WIN-OS/2 window session, if possible. Some exceptions exist, for example,
CorelDraw!** and Arts &amp; Letters**. Those programs use some very special
Windows programming techniques, which can cause some problems in a "seamless"
WIN-OS/2 VDM. This may not happen in every user scenario but it was felt
to be safer to install those applications as fullscreen SAVDMs.
<P>
The Migrate Applications program is used:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

organization's unique applications to the migration database, or to create
their own.
