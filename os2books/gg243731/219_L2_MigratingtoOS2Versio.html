<H1>Migrating to OS/2 Version 2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 251 -->
<P>
Upon completion of the installation process, the user is given the opportunity
to migrate installed Windows applications (defined to the Windows Program
Manager) to the OS/2 Version 2.0 Workplace Shell.  All Windows applications
which are to be migrated must have the appropriate DOS and Windows settings
defined in the<B> Certified Application Database</B> (<B>CAD</B>), which
is shipped as a standard component of OS/2 Version 2.0.  See also <A HREF="199_L1_InstallingandMigrati.html">Installing
and Migrating Applications</A>.
<P>
<B>Note:  </B> Only the settings for those applications which have been
certified via approved IBM testing channels will be held in the Certified
Applications Database (CAD), and only those settings which differ from the
default settings will be recorded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

<P>
If a referenced Windows application is found on any of the available disk
volumes during OS/2 installation, the existing *.INI and *.GRP files will
be read, the necessary changes applied to them, and the updated versions
stored in the \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2 directory.  This will effectively migrate
the user's Windows desktop, including all Windows applications, into a MAVDM,
SAVDM or seamless environment.
<P>
The CAD provides information enabling the installation procedure to automatically
set the DOS settings for certified DOS and Windows applications. The user
is presented with a list of the certified applications found, which can
then be migrated. The user may select any or all of these applications.
 The CAD is searched for each of the selected applications, and DOS and/or
Windows settings information found in the database will be used to automatically
assign settings to applications.  Windows applications will be placed in
a single "Windows Applications" folder.  DOS applications are placed in
a single "DOS Applications" folder.
<P>
The CAD is a binary database, generated from an ASCII database and a predefined
tag file. Each field in the ASCII database starts with a descriptive tag
that is associated with a value between 0-225 in the predefined tag file;
the maximum number of tags is therefore 256.  When the binary CAD generation
tool encounters one of the descriptive tags, it generates an entry in the
binary CAD with a 0-255 value specified in the predefined tag file.  To
add new or additional DOS properties, a short descriptive tag is created
for the ASCII file and associated with an unused value between 0-255 in
the predefined tag file. A length specification is also provided for the
value in the tag file.
<P>
Each field in the binary CAD starts with a predefined tag value of 0-255
that identifies the field. This tag is followed by a<I> size</I> field,
which in turn is followed by the actual value of the field.
<P>
Each application in the CAD has the following minimum information:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The filename used to start the application<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The title of the application<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A pointer to the next application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The filename that starts the application is used to identify the application
on the hard drive. The next application pointer points directly to the next
application entry in the CAD. This provides the ability to jump from one
entry to the next without parsing all of the tags between entries in the
CAD. The application title is displayed to the user if the application is
found on the hard drive. The user will use this information to specify if
the application is to be migrated.
<P>
The filename extensions held in the CAD will determine what files are searched
for; that is all EXE, COM and BAT files.
<P>
When the applications have been migrated into the OS/2 Version 2.0 Workplace
Shell, information for DOS applications is stored in the OS2.INI file.  Windows
settings for Windows applications are stored in the WIN.INI file, while
their DOS-related settings are stored in the OS2.INI file.
