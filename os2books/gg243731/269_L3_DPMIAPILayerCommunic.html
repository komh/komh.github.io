<H1>DPMI API Layer Communication with the Kernel</H1><!-- entering slot 310 -->
<P>
The DPMI API Layer has a small, well defined interface with the kernel.
 At system initialization time, the DPMI API Layer is registered with the
kernel through a VDH call and reports which version of DPMI it supports.
 If the VDD supports only DPMI Version 0.9, the kernel (which supports DPMI
Version 1.0) adjusts the way in which it handles certain DPMI tasks.
<P>
Kernel services that may be useful to VDDs other than the DPMI API layer
are exported as VDH services.  Services that should have use restricted
only to the DPMI API layer are made available through structures exchanged
when the DPMI API Layer virtual device driver is registered.
