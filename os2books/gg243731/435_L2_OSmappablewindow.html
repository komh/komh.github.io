OS mappable window
<P>
In addition to the normal mappable window, additional memory below 1MB can
also be remapped.  This is typically all memory from 256KB to 640KB.  This
is used by task management programs (such as Microsoft Windows) to map a
different section of expanded memory to this region for each application
it runs.  An application can, however, remap this memory.  No protection
is provided.  This memory is automatically allocated to a special handle
and is mapped when EMS starts, before the operating system touches the memory.
