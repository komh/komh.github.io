<H1>System Callback Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->
<P>
The system callback procedures are "hooks" into DOS (in the case of VDMs,
into the DOS Emulation kernel)  which allow application programs to change
the default processing action taken for certain system events. These hooks
are specified in the V86 mode interrupt vector table as trap service routines.
By default, the vectors reference a single IRET instruction if an application
does not register its own hook procedure.
<P>
The vectors used to specify the callback routines are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>INT 22h - Terminate Address</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> The DOS Emulation
kernel stores the termination return address at this vector location.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> INT
23h - Control-C Exit Address</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> The method used
to invoke this callback procedure works the same way as in a DOS 5.0 system.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>INT 24h - Critical Error Handler</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Hard
errors are normally generated from within the OS/2 kernel.  When such an
error is detected, the file system checks to see if the requesting task
is a VDM. If so, the error indication is returned to the protected mode
portion of DOS Emulation, which determines if the INT 24h vector has been
changed.
<P>
If it has not been changed, the normal OS/2 hard error monitor is called
to display the hard error information and to prompt for a reply.  If it
has been changed, the specified critical error handler is invoked.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> INT
28h - Idle Loop</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> The method used to call the
INT 28h callback routine is similar to that used in DOS 5.0, but takes into
account the fact that the DOS session is running in a multitasking environment.

<P>
The OS/2 scheduler maintains a flag in the VDM address space which indicates
if another process in the system is ready to run. While in the idle loop,
the DOS Emulation kernel repeatedly examines this flag. If no other OS/2
tasks are ready, the loop proceeds as normal. If the flag indicates that
other tasks are waiting, DOS Emulation yields control to the operating system,
which dispatches the waiting task.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
In all other respects, callback procedures operate under MVDM in an identical
manner to that experienced under DOS 5.0.
