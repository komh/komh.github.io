<H1>Virtual Timer Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 173 -->
<P>
The virtual timer device driver VTIMER.SYS provides virtualization of timers
used by DOS applications running in VDMs.  Three timer ports are supported
in order to allow reprogramming of interrupt frequency and speaker tone
frequency.  VTIMER also distributes timer ticks to VDMs and maintains a
count of timer ticks.
<P>
All accesses to the timer are simulated by VTIMER.  Therefore, unlike most
other virtual device drivers, VTIMER has no communication with the physical
timer.  VTIMER derives its timer tick directly from the system clock.
<P>
VTIMER keeps a per-VDM cumulative timer count in the VDM's data area. When
a periodic timer interrupt occurs, VTIMER receives control.  It adds the
periodic interval count value to the cumulative timer count of the VDM and
compares it with the  VDM's programmed count.  If the cumulative timer count
exceeds the VDM's programmed count, an interrupt is simulated to the VDM
and the programmed count is subtracted from the cumulative timer count.

<P>
<B>Timer 0</B>
<P>
This timer is normally used to provide periodic interrupts to DOS applications.
 A periodic system timer with an interval close to 18.2 milliseconds is
set up so that VTIMER can accumulate virtual ticks and simulate tick interrupts
if necessary.
<P>
If a VDM attempts to program an interrupt period less than 18.2 milliseconds,
the periodic timer interval will be changed to four times the normal frequency
of 18.2 Hz, regardless of the VDM's programmed value.  A<I> HighRate</I> reference
count is also kept to record the number of VDMs using a higher interrupt
rate.  As long as there is at least one VDM using a higher interrupt rate,
the periodic rate is maintained at approximately four times 18.2 Hz.  Otherwise,
the timer frequency is reset to 18.2 Hz.
<P>
Accesses to timer count registers from within a VDM are trapped by VTIMER.
 Read accesses to the count registers should be preceded by a counter latch
command written to the control word register, in which case a random value
derived from the system time is latched and stored in the virtual latch
registers.  Its purpose is to provide the applications with a sense of elapsed
time, although the count value itself is meaningless. Read access to the
count register is simulated by reading the virtual latch value.  Write accesses
to the count registers are stored in the virtual count registers.
<P>
<B>Timer 1</B>
<P>
Timer 1 is used in the PC AT [Although the IBM PC AT is based on the Intel
80286 processor and therefore is not supported by OS/2 Version 2.0, many
PC AT machines exist which have been fitted with processor upgrades from
various manufacturers, which may enable them to run OS/2 Version 2.0.  Information
on the PC AT architecture is therefore included herein for completeness.
] as the memory refresh request timer.  Since the correct operation of this
timer is vital to the system, no known software reprograms it for uses other
than reading it as the random number generator speed.  Therefore, VTIMER
does not support any access except counter read to this timer by DOS applications.
 Any accesses other than counter reads are trapped and ignored.
<P>
<B>Timer 2</B>
<P>
Timer 2 is the speaker tone generator.  It is accessed by DOS applications
directly, via programming interfaces or DevHlp services, or by the<B> VDHBeep()
</B>function. Serialization of the speaker usage can be achieved by using
a semaphore in the kernel.
<P>
When a DOS application accesses the speaker, it typically programs timer
2 for the<!-- entering slot 174 --> appropriate frequency and then enables
the speaker by programming the speaker enable bits in system control port
B.  These programming operations are trapped by VTIMER and the frequency
value is stored for the VDM.  When Control Port B is programmed to enable
the speaker, the kernel beep service is called to generate the beep. This
call may be blocked due to the fact that another process is beeping and
thus owns the speaker semaphore.  After the semaphore is obtained, the stored
frequency value is programmed into timer 2 and the speaker is enabled. The
semaphore is released when the DOS application disables the speaker by programming
the System Control Port B.
<P>
There is one exception to the speaker serialization, and this occurs during
interrupt time.  For example, when a process is generating a speaker tone,
the keyboard buffer may be full and the keyboard interrupt handler needs
to generate a warning beep immediately.  Therefore, the kernel also provides
an interrupt time beep service which can pre-empt any ongoing beeps and
use the speaker to generate its own beep regardless of which process currently
owns the speaker semaphore.
