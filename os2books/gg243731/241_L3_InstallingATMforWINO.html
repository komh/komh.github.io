<H1>Installing ATM for WIN-OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 275 -->
<P>
ATM for WIN-OS/2 is automatically installed when you install the OS/2 base
code. However, the 13 "IBM Core Fonts" that are automatically installed
for you in OS/2 PM are not installed under WIN-OS/2. In fact ATM for WIN-OS/2
is itself not active until you install at least one font. This is why you
will see an "X" over the ATM icon when you start the WIN-OS/2 Full-Screen
command prompt if you have not installed any fonts. Included on the device
drivers diskettes are the necessary font files to install these "IBM Core
Fonts" for WIN-OS/2. They are currently located on device driver diskette
#5.
<P>
As mentioned previously, it is a good idea to have the WIN-OS/2 ATM icon
on your OS2 PM desktop if you manage fonts frequently. There are two ways
to do this:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->You can use the Migrate Applications program
in the System Setup folder. However, this action will place the icon in
a folder called "Additional Windows Programs". You will then have to open
that folder and drag-and-drop the ATM Control Panel icon onto your desktop.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->You can also open the Templates folder and drag-and-drop
the Program icon on your desktop and type in the prompts. ATM for WIN-OS/2
is located in \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\ATMCNTRL.EXE. Use \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2 as your
working directory. Under Session select WIN-OS/2 window if available, otherwise
select WIN-OS/2 full screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Under certain conditions ATM may become disabled or you may want to remove
it for performance reasons if you only use standard fonts. In either case
ATM for WIN-OS/2 is activated based on entries in the SYSTEM.INI file located
in the path \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2. If installed correctly you will see the following
statements:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><B>system.drv=atmsys.drv</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><B>atm.system.drv=system.drv</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
To disable ATM:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Delete the<B> atm.system.drv=system.drv</B> statement
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Change<B> system.drv=atmsysdrv</B> to<B> system.drv=system.drv.
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
