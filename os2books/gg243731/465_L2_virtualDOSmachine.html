A protected mode process under OS/2 Version 2.0 which emulates a DOS operating
system environment, such that DOS applications executing within the virtual
machine operate exactly as if they were running under DOS. DOS virtual machines
support both text and graphics applications. Virtual DOS machines make use
of the virtual 8086 mode of the 80386 and 80486 processors.
