<H1>Creating a Customized Migration Database</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->
<P>
Some corporate users have an installed base of unique or custom-written
DOS and Windows applications. These programs will not be listed in the migration
database (DATABASE.DAT) that is supplied with OS/2 V2.0. The PARSEDB.EXE
program is provided by OS/2 V2.0 to allow a system administrator to build
a customized migration database that can be used to set up these unique
applications on the Workplace Shell desktop.
