<P>
The DOS Emulation component provides an emulation of the DOS operating system
environment, including DOS features and system services, for applications
running in virtual DOS machines. DOS Emulation uses the parameters specified
in CONFIG.SYS and virtual device drivers to create an application-compatible
DOS environment within the VDM address space.
<P>
During execution, DOS Emulation receives requests from DOS applications.
Depending upon the type of request, it either processes the request itself
or causes a general protection exception which results in the request being
routed by the operating system kernel to the 8086 Emulation component, which
processes the request at a higher privilege level.
<P>
DOS Emulation also allows DOS applications to hook interrupts, in order
to modify the default behavior in response to particular events. This is
achieved by providing a virtual interrupt vector table within the V86 mode
address space, and routing interrupts through this table.
<P>
At VDM termination time, DOS Emulation is responsible for closing all files
opened by the VDM, and cleaning up the environment to ensure that no devices
are still held or memory objects allocated after termination.
<P>
DOS Emulation also provides support for applications which access the standard
devices CON, AUX, and PRN. These devices are emulated within DOS Emulation
itself, which processes the interrupts for these devices and returns the
results to the DOS application.
