<H1>DOS and WIN-OS/2 Settings</H1><!-- entering slot 266 -->
<P>
The following DOS settings are automatically defined for any Windows application
under the Workplace Shell. If a user explicitly modifies these entries,
following these settings is recommended:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>WIN_RUNMODE</B><!-- lm: 0x12 35 -->
<UL> AUTO
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 will decide whether the Windows application will run in real or
standard mode, unless the user specifically selects a mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> KBD_CTRL_BYPAS
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 35 -->
<UL>CTRL_ESC
<P>
This keyboard sequence is required in a WIN-OS/2 MAVDM in order to bring
up the Windows List.  If not bypassed, the Ctrl+Esc sequence is trapped
by the Workplace Shell.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> MOUSE_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 35 -->
<UL>ON
<P>
Only necessary if the user wishes to run this SAVDM or MAVDM in a window
under the Workplace Shell.  Note this pertains to running the entire VDM
in a Presentation Manager window,<I> not</I> to running in seamless mode.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT</B><!-- lm: 0x12 35 -->
<UL> 2
(MB)
<P>
This is the default for the Windows environment and can always be increased
when needed.  However, decreasing this value is<I> not</I> recommended.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>IDLE_SENSITIVITY</B><!-- lm: 0x12 35 -->
<UL> 75

<P>
This is the default value.  The performance of some Windows applications
can be improved by re-adjusting this value to their specific needs.  In
particular, applications which make extensive use of the mouse may exhibit
"jumpy" mouse movement when IDLE_SENSITIVITY is allowed to default; for
such applications, IDLE_SENSITIVITY should be set to 100, which disables
idle detection.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
