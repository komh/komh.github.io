The following settings affect print functions within a VDM.
<P>
<B>PRINT_TIMEOUT</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Use this setting to adjust the
amount of time, in seconds, that the OS/2 V2.0 print subsystem waits before
forcing a print job to the printer. In DOS, information sent by a program
for printing goes directly to a printer. However, the OS/2 V2.0 print subsystem
assembles print information in a spool file. After a specified  period of
time, during which the spool file does not grow larger, OS/2 V2.0 print
subsystem sends the information to the printer as a single print job.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantage:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>There is no need to exit the DOS program before
the print job is released by the OS/2 V2.0 print subsystem.  This is useful
for applications which do not explicitly close their print jobs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>15 seconds, configurable from 0 to 3600 seconds
(0 seconds is no timeout).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At
any time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> A
timeout of 1 or 2 seconds is sufficient for small print jobs, such as copying
the contents of the screen. However, when printing large files, formatting
documents, or running calculations, the value must be set high enough to
allow all print results to reach the spooler before the time limit expires.
 If not, results go in two or more spool files instead of one, and the resulting
output may be unsatisfactory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
