<H1>Abnormal Termination</H1><!-- entering slot 197 -->
<P>
Virtual device drivers may experience a number of different error conditions,
and must be able to act in order to recover from such errors where possible.

<P>
<B>Errors Returned from VDH Services</B>
<P>
Requests for VDH services may be refused by the operating system or may
fail due to lack of resources.  For example, a call to<B> VDHAllocMem()
</B>may return 0, indicating that the memory allocation request cannot be
satisfied.
<P>
During initialization of the virtual device driver or creation of a VDM
such an error would cause the initialization or creation to be terminated.
During execution of a DOS application, the virtual device driver should
return control to the application, indicating the failure of the requested
application service.  If this cannot be done, the VDM must be terminated.

<P>
<B>Bad Parameter Passed to VDH Service</B>
<P>
A virtual device driver may make a service request with bad data, typically
due to a bug in the device driver code; such events are likely during development
and testing.  For example, the virtual device driver may attempt to issue
a<B> VDHFreeMem()</B> function call specifying an address which was not
previously allocated using<B> VDHAllocMem()</B>.
<P>
Such errors are costly; since virtual device drivers operate at privilege
level 0 and hence have access to all code and data in the system, it is
impossible to localize the effect to a single VDM, or to be certain that
the event has not corrupted data or control structures in the operating
system kernel.  In such cases, the Virtual DOS Machine Manager will halt
the system.
<P>
<B>Virtual Device Driver Consistency Failures</B>
<P>
A virtual device driver may detect inconsistencies within its own state
information.  Such inconsistencies may be experienced in either global or
instance state data.  The virtual device driver must inform the user of
the error.  If the error can be isolated to the instance data of a single
VDM, that VDM must be terminated.  If the error is in global state data,
it will be necessary to halt the system.
<P>
Note that halting the entire system is highly unfriendly behavior on the
part of a virtual device driver.  Very rarely, if ever, should such action
become necessary.  A virtual device driver should take all possible steps
to isolate any state inconsistencies to a single VDM only.
<P>
<B>Illegal Operation by a DOS Application</B>
<P>
DOS applications running in VDMs may issue illegal instructions.  For example,
a DOS application may issue an OUT instruction to a port controlled by the
virtual disk device driver, which does not support direct hardware control
of the disk controller.
<P>
In such cases, the virtual device driver must inform the user of the error
condition and either ignore the error or terminate the VDM and the application
within it.
