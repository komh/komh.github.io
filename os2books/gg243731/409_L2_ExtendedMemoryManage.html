Extended Memory Manager
<P>
Virtual device driver which provides emulation of LIMA XMS services to DOS
applications running in virtual DOS machines.  Unlike most virtual device
drivers, the Extended Memory Manager does not use a physical device driver,
but interacts directly with the operating system's memory manager to map
XMS memory requests into the system's linear address space.  Also known
as XMM.
