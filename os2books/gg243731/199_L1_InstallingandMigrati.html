<P>
Installing DOS and Windows applications under OS/2 V2.0 is in most cases
very similar to installing them in their native environments. However, since
OS/2 V2.0 is a true multitasking operating system, we should ensure that
the installation programs do not introduce incompatibilities with existing
programs. The flexibility in tailoring the virtual DOS machine environment
for these programs, also gives us an opportunity to easily tune DOS settings
to suit our needs.
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 has a utility to help users place their application icons onto
the desktop after they have been installed. The utility uses information
stored in a migration database that is shipped with OS/2 V2.0.
<P>
Systems administrators can use another utility to create their own migration
database to install their corporation's unique applications.
<P>
This chapter discusses the installation of DOS and Windows applications
under OS/2 V2.0. It also shows how to use the application migration utilities
shipped with OS/2 V2.0.
<P>
We describe the use of the migration program in this chapter, and show an
example of how to use the PARSEDB utility to create a customized migration
database.
