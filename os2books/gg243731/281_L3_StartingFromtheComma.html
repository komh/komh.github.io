<H1>Starting From the Command Line</H1><!-- entering slot 322 -->
<P>
A DOS application can also be started from a DOS or OS/2 command line. Note,
however, that starting the application in this way provides no opportunity
to configure the VDM environment to support particular application requirements.
Certain settings may be changed during application execution. However, such
settings will be saved and will remain in effect until explicitly reset
by the user.
<P>
The default settings also allocate resources for EMS, XMS and DPMI support,
which may not be required by the DOS application. For these reasons, it
is recommended that DOS applications which require non-default settings
be configured and started from the Workplace Shell wherever possible.
<P>
When starting the application from a DOS command line, the application loads
and executes within the VDM which displayed the command line. All DOS environment
settings used by the application are those in effect for the VDM when the
application was started. When the application terminates, control is returned
to the command line.
<P>
When starting the application from an OS/2 command line, the operating system
reads the program file from disk, and determines from the executable file
header that the program is a DOS or Windows application rather than an OS/2
application. The operating system then automatically creates a VDM and loads
the application into the VDM. When the application terminates, the VDM is
also terminated and control returns to the OS/2 command line.
<P>
Note that in either case, execution is synchronous, and the command line
is<I> not</I> available for use while the application is running. An application
may be started asynchronously from an OS/2 command line using the START
command. In this case, the operating system creates an asynchronous VDM
and loads the application into this VDM. The OS/2 command line remains available
even though the DOS application is still running.
