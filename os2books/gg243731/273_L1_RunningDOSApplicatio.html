<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 allows the user to run multiple DOS applications concurrently,
with each application running in its own virtual DOS machine, with pre-emptive
multitasking and full memory protection.
<P>
This chapter describes the way in which a DOS application can be defined
to the OS/2 Version 2.0 Workplace Shell, and the ways in which an application
may be started. It also discusses the way in which version-specific DOS
applications may be run in virtual DOS machines under OS/2 Version 2.0.
