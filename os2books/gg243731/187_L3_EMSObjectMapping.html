<H1>EMS Object Mapping</H1><!-- entering slot 205 -->
<P>
Mappable windows are located by asking the Virtual DOS Machine Manager to
provide free linear regions after other virtual device drivers have claimed
the address ranges required for their hardware.  The base window (region
from 256KB to RMSIZE) is mapped to an expanded object at VDM  creation time.
 This window is used as normal memory by DOS or DOS applications, but can
also be remapped by applications that wish to do so.
<P>
Some applications assume mappable regions begin on 17KB boundaries, although
this is not part of the EMS specification.  OS/2 Version 2.0 follows this
undocumented convention.
<P>
There are multiple techniques for saving and restoring mappings in LIM.
Save tables and copies of parts of register sets copied to application memory
can be used to save and restore mappings.  All contain a pairing of physical
segment and &lt;handle, logical page&gt; pairs.  Saving of mappings is done
by segment, handle, and logical page entries to the buffer in which the
save is performed.  For saves that save the entire mapping, the register
index need not be stored.  Mappings are restored by making a set of aliasing
calls to the memory manager, and copying the new mapping into the active
register set.
<P>
Illegal mappings are mapped to<B> black hole</B> pages. A black hole page
is a page that does not cause faults, but which need not store values written
to it. Black hole pages can be implemented as invalid addresses that float
on the bus, ROM pages if there is no ROM caching, a wasted physical memory
page, or a discardable page.
<P>
Structures returned to the client will use physical pages rather than segments
since these are smaller for the client to store and are simpler to check
for validity when restored.  All save structures held by the V86 client
use a checksum to detect tampering by the V86 client.
<P>
LIM allows an application to reallocate the special handle that contains
conventional memory, thus allowing the expanded memory to be reused.  This
is supposed to be done only by an operating system program that knows the
special handle is handle 0, but may conceivably be done by any application.
Note that applications can deallocate the DOS memory area.  If they do this
and fail to restore it, COMMAND.COM is unable to reload and the VDM will
terminate.  This behavior is identical to a native DOS environment.
<P>
<B>Register Sets</B>
<P>
Application requests to map pages into a register set are handled by storing
the new mappings in the register set data structure.  A call is made to
the memory manager to alias pages or set them to a black hole for unmapped
pages.
<P>
The current register set is changed to a new register set by aliasing linear
memory through memory manager calls according to the new registers and changing
the current register set variable.  Other calls allow saving and restoring
register sets from an application-supplied<!-- entering slot 206 --> array
similar to Save/Restore above.
<P>
<B>Allocating/Deallocating Objects</B>
<P>
Upon receiving an application request to allocate, reallocate, or deallocate
an EMS object, VEMM transforms the request into corresponding calls to the
OS/2 Version 2.0 memory manager.  Each EMS object is allocated as a separate
memory object in a linear address range in the VDM's process address space,
but outside the V86 mode address space.  The memory manager returns the
start address and size of each EMS object to VEMM, which then updates its
EMS handle table accordingly.
<P>
Allocations are made by selecting a free EMS object handle; a free handle
has a start address of zero.  VEMM then requests the memory manager to allocate
the required memory, and records the start address and size of the object
as returned by the memory manager.  The total allocation size for each VDM
and the total allocations across all VDMs are maintained so that the maximum
allocation size is not exceeded.  If an allocation is of size zero, no actual
allocation is made and a non-zero address and zero size are recorded in
the handle entry.
<P>
When a deallocation request is made, the address in the handle is changed
to 0 and the memory manager is called to free the allocation.  Reallocation
requests are serviced by passing on the request to a VDH service and recording
the new size and start address.  Since reallocations may lead to object
movement, pages mapped from the object are unmapped before reallocation
and remapped afterward.
<P>
When an application reallocates to zero, VEMM has the memory manager deallocate
the memory object, and changes the handle table entry so it has zero pages
with a meaningless non-zero address to indicate the handle is still in use.
 Objects of size zero are allowed in VEMM, but not in OS/2, so VEMM will
free the memory but retain its own data for the object handle. When a non-zero
reallocation is performed on the object, a new object is transparently allocated.

<P>
LIM allows an application to deallocate memory that is mapped into the current
register set, alternate register sets, or save maps (all internal structures
that save mappings).  EMS is silent about what should happen if an application
touches this mapped memory after deallocation.  Since 8086 applications
are generally allowed to search through the address space without harm,
these deallocated pages should be remapped to a black hole.
<P>
Searching through all 255 SaveMaps and 15 non-current register sets is expensive
even with optimizations.  Exhaustive search slows deallocations and shrinking
reallocations, and keeping track of the locations of mappings slows mapping
operations.  Therefore, upon deallocation or shrinking reallocation, only
the current register set is checked for deallocated pages.  Stored registers
(255 SaveMaps and 15 RegSets for the VDM) will not be checked until they
are reactivated.  When an invalid page is found during remapping, it is
simply remapped to the black hole.
