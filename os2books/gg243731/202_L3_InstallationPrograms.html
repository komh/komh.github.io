<H1>Installation Programs with Special Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 227 -->
<P>
Some DOS application installation programs will not run properly in the
OS/2 V2.0 virtual DOS machine, or will not install the program correctly.
Some of the possible problems are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The installation program attempts to verify the
version of DOS that is running, and receives a response that it cannot understand.
One example is Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3.1+.
<P>
The OS/2 V2.0 virtual DOS machine environment can be customized to return
a DOS version in response to the installation program query and thus bypass
the problem. This is accomplished by changing the<I> DOS_Version</I>  parameters
in the DOS Settings facility, which is accessed by pressing the<I> DOS Settings
</I>push button on the<I> Session</I> page of the<I> Settings</I> notebook.

<P>
The DOS Settings facility and the available settings are described in detail
in <A HREF="284_L1_DOSSettings.html">DOS Settings</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The copy protection or user registration scheme
implemented by the application bypasses DOS and directly accesses the disk.
The OS/2 V2.0 system will not allow the installation program to do this,
since it may interfere with other applications, and will terminate the virtual
DOS machine in which it is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
It may therefore be necessary to perform the installation in a native DOS
environment by rebooting the workstation with a DOS boot diskette. When
the installation is complete, the workstation can be rebooted under OS/2
V2.0 and the application added to the Workplace Shell.
