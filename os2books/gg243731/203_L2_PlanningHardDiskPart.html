<P>
If the workstation is booted from a DOS diskette in order to perform the
DOS application install, the installation is restricted to those logical
drives that have been formatted as FAT. This is because logical HPFS drives
cannot be accessed in a native DOS environment.
<P>
When the system is booted with DOS 5, HPFS drives are not assigned drive
letters and are invisible to the user. If DOS 4.01 with CSD UR35284 is used
to perform the boot, drive letters will be assigned to all drives, whether
HPFS or FAT. However, you cannot access the files on the HPFS drives. With
earlier versions of DOS, even FAT drives that lie beyond the first HPFS
drive will not be assigned drive letters.
<P>
Some installation programs store directory information into control files
that are used at run time. For example, WordPerfect** 5.1 records the path
to its subdirectories. On a hard disk with both FAT and HPFS logical drives,
this can cause the installation program run in native DOS to record drive
assignments that are wrong when the application is started from a virtual
DOS machine.
<P>
Consider the following example of a hard disk setup for dual boot or with
Boot Manager:

<P>
Note that FAT drive in the extended partition appears as drive E: to the
OS/2 Version 2.0 virtual DOS machine, but appears as drive D: when booted
under DOS. Consequently, if the DOS application is installed on that partition
when the system was booted under DOS, the drive letter it records in its
control files will be D:. When the system is rebooted under OS/2 V2.0 and
the application is run from a virtual DOS machine, the application will
be looking to drive D:, which under OS/2 V2.0 is assigned to the HPFS drive
of the extended partition. This will cause the application to miss the information
it is seeking.
<P>
The user may be able to change the control file information and correct
the error through the application. However, if the system is booted from
DOS and the application is started, it will again be looking for the wrong
drive.
<P>
In order to avoid this confusion we recommend that HPFS logical drives be
placed last. In the above example, the FAT and HPFS logical drives in the
extended partition should be transposed. This will allow the drive letters
for the FAT partitions to be the same regardless of whether the workstation
is booted from DOS or OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>

OS/2 2.0 Installation Guide.</I>
