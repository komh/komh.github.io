<H1>Lab Session 6: VDM Boot</H1><!-- entering slot 422 -->
<P>
In this exercise, the student will create a new<B> DOS Full Screen</B> item
in the command prompts folder.  This new DOS session will be configured
so as to boot a "shrink wrap" version of DOS 5.0 instead of utilizing OS/2
2.0s emulated version of DOS.
<P>
In order to boot an 8086 kernel into a VDM, that kernel's boot record must
be obtained from either a bootable diskette, an image file of that diskette,
or a DOS hard disk partition.
<P>
The student will be required to configure a VDM which can, in turn, boot
DOS from any of these sources.
