<P>
The UNDELETE utility recovers files that have been deleted or erased.  When
the DEL or ERASE command is issued from any session type, the file is moved
to a specified hidden directory, along with details of where the file originated.
 If no space is available, the oldest files are automatically purged to
provide more space.
<P>
The DELDIR environment variable is used to specify the name and maximum
size of the directories where files targeted for deletion are to be stored.
 Normally this will be set in CONFIG.SYS, and takes the form:
<PRE>  SET DELDIR = drive:\path, maxsize [;drive:\path, maxsize]
</PRE>

<P>
The string is composed of a directory path specifier and maximum size value
for each supported logical drive. These parameters are separated by commas.
The definitions for each drive are separated by semicolons.
<P>
The path portion of the string consists of a drive letter and the fully
qualified path of the directory that will be used for storing deleted files.

<P>
The maxsize portion of the string defines the maximum size of the storage
directory, in kilobytes.
<P>
In order to keep track of deleted files, the system also maintains a control
file in each storage directory.
<P>
When UNDELETE is specified and the file is still recoverable, it is restored
to its specified path. If the file already exists, the user is prompted
to rename the file, or to skip the current entry.
<P>
Space occupied by recoverable files is included in DIR and CHKDSK output
reports.
<P>
The format of the UNDELETE command is :
<PRE>  undelete &lt;filename&gt; [/list | /all] [/s] [/force]
</PRE>

<UL> is the path and name of
the file to recover or purge. It may be wildcarded.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>/l(ist)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> lists deleted files that are
available to be recovered without recovering the files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>/a(ll)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> recovers all deleted files if
they are still present without prompting for confirmation on each file.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>/s</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> include all files in the specified
directory and all subdirectories<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>/f(orce)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> removes files so they cannot
be recovered.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

UNDELETE runs in both protect mode and in a DOS VDM.
