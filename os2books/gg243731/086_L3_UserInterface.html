<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 also provides an enhanced user shell, known as the <A HREF="479_L2_WorkplaceShell.html"><B>Workplace
Shell</B></A>*, through enhancements to Presentation Manager.  The Workplace
Shell is object-based and implements the 1991 SAA CUA Workplace Environment.
 This shell is more intuitive than the Presentation Manager shell implemented
in previous versions of OS/2, and allows users to become familiar with the
system more quickly.
<P>
In the Workplace Shell, system resources, such as files and printers, are
regarded as objects, and represented by graphical icons on the screen. Users
may manipulate objects (open them for editing, copy them, and print them,
for example) by direct manipulation of the icons.  For example, a file is
copied from one location to another by pointing to it with the mouse,<I> dragging
</I>the object's icon to the required destination, and<I> dropping</I> the
icon by releasing the mouse button.  This is known as<B> drag and drop</B> manipulation.

<P>
Presentation Manager and the Workplace Shell are described in more detail
in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 3:  Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell</I>.
