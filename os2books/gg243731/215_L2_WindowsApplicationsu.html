<H1>Windows Applications under OS/2 Version 2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 242 -->
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, Windows applications are treated as special cases
of DOS applications, which need a special environment in which to run.  Therefore,
the key to Windows application compatibility is to provide these applications
with as similar an environment as possible to that experienced under DOS,
while taking advantage of the inherent design superiority of OS/2.
