Expanded Memory Manager
<P>
Virtual device driver which provides emulation of LIM EMS Version 4.0 services
to DOS applications running in virtual DOS machines.  Unlike most virtual
device drivers, the Expanded Memory Manager does not use a physical device
driver, but interacts directly with the operating system's memory manager
to map EMS memory requests into the system's linear address space.  Also
known as EMM.
