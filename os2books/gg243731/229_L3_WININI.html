<P>
WIN.INI contains a number of sections which may be customized by the user,
including which applications should be started or run when a Windows MAVDM
is started. Each Windows application is recorded in a separate section indicating
the drive and path to execute the application. The supported file extensions,
for each application installed, are recorded in the<I> Extensions</I> section.

<P>
Users need to be careful when applying any changes to this file, especially
when it comes to configuring of any device drivers.  The user might install
a device driver which either does not exist or is not supported under OS/2
V2.0, such as specialized video device drivers.
<P>
Most, but not all, Windows applications also have their private entries
in the WIN.INI file.  Usually, such entries consist merely of a pointer
to the application's own working directory.  However, some applications
register all their installation-dependent configuration information, and
may therefore be very dependent upon finding their data in this file.  The
migration process will take care of these entries and migrate them appropriately.
