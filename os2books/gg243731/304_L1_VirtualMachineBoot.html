<P>
An important goal of OS/2 Version 2.0 is the ability to run past, current,
and future DOS programs; indeed most DOS applications available today run
unchanged in the MVDM environment.
<P>
However, it should be remembered that the "DOS" which runs in this case
is highly optimized for (and specific to) an OS/2 Version 2.0 virtual 8086
machine. Because of this, there are fundamental internal differences between
the DOS Emulation provided under OS/2 Version 2.0 and "real" DOS. Two problems
may therefore arise:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Some programs may depend on specific DOS features
such as internal control blocks, LAN Redirector hooks, or even undocumented
functions, which are not present in MVDM's DOS Emulation.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Only DOS<I> character</I> device drivers can
be loaded in MVDM's DOS Emulation. The user may own a<I> block</I> device
(such as a special disk or tape drive) for which no OS/2 driver is available.
(A block device is one accessed via a drive letter, such as E:).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="470_L2_VMB.html"><B>Virtual Machine Boot</B> (<B>VMB</B>)</A> solves
both these problems. It allows the user to boot "off-the-shelf" DOS and
use block device drivers in an OS/2 Version 2.0 virtual DOS machine, ensuring
greater compatibility for DOS applications.
<P>
Another possible use of VMB is to run DOS of a different National Language
to that of OS/2 Version 2.0 itself. This may be useful in a multilingual
environment.
