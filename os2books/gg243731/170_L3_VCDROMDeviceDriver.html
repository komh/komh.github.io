<H1>VCDROM Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 183 -->
<P>
The VCDROM virtual device driver enables audio support for CD-ROM applications
running in virtual DOS machines. In native DOS, audio and other IOCTL support
is provided by the pass-through function of the CD-ROM file system driver,
MSCDEX. VCDROM provides two features necessary to support DOS CD-ROM applications:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It emulates the presence of the MSCDEX<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->It translates the DOS style IOCTLs into requests that
the physical CD-ROM device driver can understand.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
VCDROM provides only audio IOCTL support and not a full emulation of MSCDEX,
as most DOS CD-ROM applications use the standard DOS interface for file
system services and the MSCDEX interface for audio services only. Any application
that calls MSCDEX for file system services will not run in a virtual DOS
machine.
