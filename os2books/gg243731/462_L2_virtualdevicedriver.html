virtual device driver
<P>
Form of device driver used by DOS applications executing in a virtual DOS
machine, in order to access devices which must be shared with other processes
in the system, such as the screen or mouse.  A virtual device driver typically
maps DOS device commands to the physical device driver in the protected
mode environment under OS/2 Version 2.0.
