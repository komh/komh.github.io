<H1>Hardware Interrupt Simulation</H1><!-- entering slot 158 -->
<P>
A virtual device driver typically establishes communications with a physical
device driver and receives events at hardware interrupt time. Based on the
event received from the physical device driver and the VDM's current state,
the virtual device driver may need to send a hardware interrupt to the VDM.
 However, the virtual device driver cannot simply call the VDM's interrupt
handler, since the interrupt handler may currently be paged out, and page
faults cannot be taken on the VDM's interrupt handler code at hardware interrupt
time.
<P>
The solution is to "simulate" the hardware interrupt to the VDM by delaying
it until the VDM process becomes active.  This is done in three steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->The VDM's interrupt request flag for the particular
interrupt level (IRQ) is set, and a global context hook is set to pass control
to the virtual device driver as soon as<I> any</I> VDM becomes active.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A VDM context hook is set, which increases the
priority of the target VDM, based on the priority of the interrupt, thereby
enabling fast interrupt processing by the VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->When the VDM is scheduled and the interrupt request
flag is noted, the VDM's interrupt handler code is invoked.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The VDM's interrupt handler typically issues a request for the interrupt
data or an EOI instruction.  When the virtual device driver receives either
of these, it calls the<B> VDHClearVIRR()</B> helper service to clear the
interrupt request flag. If the interrupt request flag is not cleared before
the VDM issues an EOI instruction, the virtual device driver immediately
simulates another interrupt to the VDM.  For example, the virtual timer
device driver may leave the interrupt request flag set when it receives
the EOI from a previously simulated interrupt, if it has another hardware
timer interrupt pending for that VDM.
<P>
<B>Clearing Interrupts</B>
<P>
Note that a virtual device driver must call the<B> VDHClearVIRR()</B> helper
service when the VDM issues an EOI instruction.  Otherwise, the application
may receive spurious interrupts because the interrupt request flag is not
cleared.  For this reason, unknown device interrupts are not supported for
VDMs, since there is typically no virtual device driver to clear the interrupt
request flag.
<P>
Interrupts must be simulated to VDMs as quickly as possible.  It is not
advisable for a virtual device driver to have too many interrupts pending
since the physical device driver's buffers may overflow.
<P>
A virtual device must also be very careful when it simulates an interrupt
to a VDM because too many nested interrupts may cause the application's
stack to overflow.  A virtual device driver should wait until the IRET instruction
has been executed in the VDM's interrupt handler before it simulates the
next interrupt; the virtual device driver may gain control immediately upon
IRET being issued, via an IRET handler registered using the<B> VDHOpenVIRQ()
</B>helper service.
<P>
<B>Shared Interrupts</B>
<P>
Personal System/2 machines equipped with the IBM Micro Channel* bus architecture
support multiple hardware devices on the same IRQ level. Hence, support
may also be required for virtual device drivers to share interrupts.  This
support is provided through the<B> VDHOpenVIRQ()</B> helper function, which
accepts a flag indicating that a virtual device driver is willing to share
its IRQ.  Note that<I> all</I> virtual device drivers using the same IRQ
must pass the sharing flag; otherwise, an error is returned.
<P>
Each virtual device driver receives an IRQ handle, which points to an IRQ
data block specific to that device driver.  Data not specific to the virtual
device driver is contained in a shared IRQ data structure.
<P>
When an interrupt is received for a VDM, the virtual interrupt request flag
is set and a device request mask is updated.  This device request mask is
specific to each VDM, and contains a bit for every virtual device driver
which has requested a virtual interrupt for the IRQ.  When the interrupt
is cleared, the device mask bit for the virtual device driver is cleared.
 However, the virtual interrupt request flag is not cleared until all virtual
device drivers have cleared the interrupt.
<P>
Note that EOI and IRET handler routines are called when the device mask
bit is cleared, allowing virtual device drivers to perform correct interrupt
termination handling.
