NPX
<P>
Numeric Processor Extension; term used in reference to the exception condition
generated by the 80386 processor when an application issues a numeric coprocessor
instruction in a machine with no coprocessor installed.  Note that OS/2
Version 2.0 will trap the NPX exception and emulate the numeric coprocessor
function within the operating system, returning the result to the application
exactly as if a physical coprocessor were installed.
