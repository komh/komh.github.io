<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 enables the user to start multiple DOS applications in
multiple concurrent VDMs, all of which are controlled by the <A HREF="466_L2_VirtualDOSMachineMan.html"><B>Virtual
DOS Machine Manager</B> (<B>VDMM</B>)</A>.

The VDMM creates a VDM by:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

</A>
<P>
The VDMM is responsible for handling those 8086 instructions which cannot
be executed in V86 mode, such as interrupts. Such instructions cause an
exception to be generated by the 80386 processor; this exception is passed
to an exception handler within the operating system, which checks the VM
bit in the current process's EFLAGs control area. If the VM bit is set,
control is passed to the VDMM. The VDMM therefore runs as a protected mode
system level process at privilege level 0.
