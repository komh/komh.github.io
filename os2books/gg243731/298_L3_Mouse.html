The following settings affect the behavior of the mouse in a VDM.
<P>
<B>MOUSE_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Function:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> This setting allows VDMs to run
applications which maintain their own mouse pointers.  Some DOS applications
manage their own mouse positions and movements; in many cases, the application's
values for mouse sensitivity and/or double speed threshold are different
from those of Presentation Manager.  As a result, a Presentation Manager
mouse pointer may be outside the VDM window while the application pointer
is somewhere in the window not receiving any mouse events. This means having
two asynchronous mouse pointers on the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Advantages:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>The user forces the physical mouse driver to
send its events directly to the virtual mouse driver without going through
Presentation Manager.  Only one mouse pointer appears when the particular
VDM window has the focus.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Default:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> OFF.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Settable:</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> At any
time.
<P>
However, this only marks the VDM window and does not actually activate the
setting.  In order to activate it, the user must press a mouse button within
the VDM window.  The Presentation Manager pointer disappears, leaving only
the application pointer.  In order to regain the Presentation Manager pointer,
the user must press any of the hot-keys (Alt, Ctrl+Esc, Shift+Esc).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Examples:
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL>WordPerfect 5.1 has its own block-shaped mouse
pointer, which will appear together with the system mouse pointer when the
window has the focus. Turning<I> MOUSE_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS</I> on allows the
user to remove the system mouse pointer when in WordPerfect.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
