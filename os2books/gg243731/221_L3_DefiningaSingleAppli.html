<H1>Defining a Single Application VDM (SAVDM)</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
For a SAVDM, the Windows application name is entered into the<I> Path and
Filename</I> field on the<I> Program</I> page of the<I> Settings</I> notebook.
The Workplace Shell then determines the application type. Upon detecting
that the application is a Windows application, the<I> Program Type</I> in
the<I> Session</I> page of the notebook will be set to<I> Windows Full Screen</I>.
When a user interactively creates a program object for a Windows  application
 and the Workplace Shell determines it is a real mode application,<I> Windows
Full Screen</I> will be marked as the default and the application will be
started as a SAVDM.
<P>
Each SAVDM has its own icon on the Workplace Shell desktop, for the application
within the SAVDM.  This icon is the normal Windows icon for this application.
 The icon title text will be the text specified in the<I> Title</I> field
in the<I> General</I> page of the<I> Settings</I> notebook.
