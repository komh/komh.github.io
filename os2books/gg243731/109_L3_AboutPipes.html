<H1>About Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 116 -->
<P>
A<I> pipe</I> is a named or unnamed buffer used to pass data between processes.
A process writes to or reads from a pipe as if the pipe were standard input
or standard output.  A parent process can use pipes to control the input
that a child process receives and to receive the output that the child process
produces. There are two types of pipes - named and unnamed. The only supported
pipe to be used between a DOS application in a VDM and an OS/2 program is
the<B> named pipe</B>.
