<H1>DPMI Hosts and Clients</H1><!-- entering slot 296 -->
<P>
DPMI services are provided by a DPMI<I> host</I> program.  Programs which
use DPMI services are known as DPMI<I> clients</I>.  Generally, DPMI clients
fall into two categories:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Extended applications<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Applications that use DPMI directly.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Most DPMI applications are likely to be extended applications.  These applications
are bound with a DOS extender, which is the actual DPMI client since it
requests DPMI services on the application's behalf.  The application calls
DOS extender services, which are then translated by the DOS extender into
DPMI service calls.  The advantage of an extended application over one that
calls DPMI services directly is that generally, an extender will support
functions other than DPMI services.  In fact, it is recommended that extenders
look for extension services in the following order:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->DPMI<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->VCPI/EMS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->XMS<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Top-down (INT 15h).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Extended memory may be allocated "top-down" by hooking the BIOS extended
memory size system call (INT 15h, function 88h) and reporting less memory
available than is actually present on the machine.  This method may be used
by DOS extenders to allocate a contiguous block of memory starting at the
top of extended memory and growing downward.  Since other applications querying
the amount of memory available in the system will not be able to "see" this
upper portion of memory, the memory is available solely to the DOS extender.

<P>
A DPMI client can provide a single set of functions to an application, and
then translate these functions to one or more underlying services (for example,
DPMI, EMS, and/or XMS) provided by the client.  Where the corresponding
host's services are lacking in a particular function, the extender must
itself provide that function for the application.  This is illustrated in
<A HREF="054_L2_ClientServerStructur.html">Figure "Client/Server Structure
for Operating System Extenders"</A>.
<P>
As shown in <A HREF="054_L2_ClientServerStructur.html">Figure "Client/Server
Structure for Operating System Extenders"</A>, application code directly
accesses a set of base extender functions.  The extender then has separate
modules for each type of extension service, and itself contains code to
provide functions in which the underlying service layers are lacking.
<P>
Readers should refer to the<I> DPMI 1.0 Specification</I> published by the
DPMI committee for information concerning the external interfaces available
to DPMI applications.  Copies of the specification may be obtained by contacting
Intel Literature Sales, P.O. Box 58130, Santa Clara, CA 95052.
