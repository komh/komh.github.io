<H1>Expanded and Extended Memory Support</H1><!-- entering slot 94 -->
<P>
Many popular DOS applications use EMS (expanded) and/or XMS (extended) memory
extenders to gain access to memory in protected mode on the 80286, 80386,
or 80486 processors.  These extenders allow DOS applications to access memory
above the 1MB real-mode addressing limit, in order to have total code and
data space larger than the available base memory, and to have very large
code or data objects loaded into memory for enhanced function and performance.
 The standard configuration of OS/2 Version 2.0 provides both EMS and XMS
functions as part of MVDM.
<P>
Under MVDM, EMS and XMS memory allocations are managed as OS/2 pageable
virtual memory in the same way as any other memory allocated under OS/2
Version 2.0, and not as fixed physical memory as is the case under DOS.
 As such, the total expanded/extended memory allocated can exceed the amount
of physical memory installed in the system.
<P>
<B>LIM EMS Version 4.0 Support</B>
<P>
The LIM (Lotus-Intel-Microsoft) Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) Version
4.0 provides a standard interface for the use of expanded memory with Intel
80x86 computers.  The specification allows for up to 32MB of expanded memory,
with up to 255 expanded memory objects.  Regions within these objects can
be mapped into the 8086 address space (below 1MB) as required, allowing
DOS applications to access large address spaces.
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, EMS emulation provides the following function:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Implements all the required functions in the LIM 4.0
EMS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provides each VDM with a logically separate EMS emulation.
 Each VDM has its own set of expanded objects so that features like interprocess
communication work as they would if each VDM were running on a different
physical 8086.  A VDM cannot affect the availability of objects in other
VDMs or access expanded memory "owned" by other VDMs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provides for remapping of conventional memory (below
640KB) for use by programs such as Windows 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provides configurable limits for how much expanded
memory is available for all VDMs, as well as a limit per VDM.  An installed
program in the start list allows the user to override the per-VDM limit,
subject to the constraints imposed by the overall limit.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Supports multiple physical to single logical mappings.
 Different 8086 addresses can map to the same expanded memory object address.
This is required by programs like Lotus 1-2-3**.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
EMS emulation is provided in MVDM by the <A HREF="468_L2_VirtualExpandedMemor.html"><B>Virtual
Expanded Memory Manager</B> (<B>VEMM</B>)</A>.  VEMM is a virtual device
driver offering a separate EMS emulation for each VDM.  This is accomplished
by placing most EMS control structures for a VDM in a per-VDM instance data
area outside the V86 application's address space.
<P>
Unlike most virtual device drivers, VEMM does not have a corresponding physical
device driver. Rather, VEMM traps software interrupts for EMS services using
a system call and manages the appropriate memory.  VEMM depends upon the
memory management capabilities of the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating system
kernel.  Allocation, reallocation, or deallocation of EMS memory objects
is accomplished by requesting corresponding services from VDH services.

<P>
<B>LIMA XMS Version 2.0 Support</B>
<P>
The LIMA Extended Memory Specification (XMS) V2.0 provides a standard interface
for the use of extended memory on Intel 80286, 80386, and 80486 computers.
 XMS functions allow for the moving of code and data objects from base memory
into extended memory, and from extended memory to base memory.  Two of the
<!-- entering slot 95 -->best known programs using XMS functions are print
spoolers and virtual disks (RAM disks).
<P>
The XMS specifications manage three distinct regions of memory:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The <A HREF="415_L2_highmemoryarea.html"><B>High Memory
Area</B> (<B>HMA</B>)</A> is located immediately above 1MB and is exactly
65520 bytes (64KB - 16 bytes) in size.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The<B> Upper Memory Area</B> (<B>UMA</B>), consisting
of <A HREF="459_L2_uppermemoryblock.html"><B>Upper Memory Blocks</B> (<B>UMB</B>s)</A>,
is located between 640KB and 1MB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The <A HREF="408_L2_extendedmemoryblockE.html"><B>Extended
Memory Blocks</B> (<B>EMB</B>s)</A> are used only for data storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, LIMA XMS emulation provides the following function:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Implements all LIMA V2.0 XMS functions.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provides each VDM with a separate XMS emulation.  Each
VDM has its own high memory area, upper memory area, and extended memory
blocks, so that features like interprocess communication work as they would
if each VDM were running on a different physical 8086 processor.  VDMs cannot
affect the availability of objects in other VDMs or access memory "owned"
by other VDMs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Provides configurable limits for how much extended
memory is available across all VDMs, as well as a limit per VDM.  An installed
program in the start list can override the per-VDM limit, subject to the
constraint given by the overall limit, and can disable XMS support altogether
for a particular VDM if its installation conflicts with the program being
run in the VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The <A HREF="409_L2_ExtendedMemoryManage.html"><B>Virtual Extended Memory
Manager</B> (<B>VXMS</B>)</A> is a virtual device driver that provides a
separate XMS emulation for each VDM.  As with VEMM, this is accomplished
by placing most VXMS control structures for a VDM in a per-VDM instance
data area outside the V86 application's address space.  The amount of memory
available to a VDM, the number of handles, and the existence of upper memory
blocks are all configurable parameters which may be altered on a per-VDM
basis.
<P>
Like the VEMM virtual device driver, VXMS does not have a corresponding
physical device driver, and utilizes the memory management capabilities
of the operating system kernel.  XMS object allocation, reallocation and
deallocation are accomplished by requesting corresponding services from
the memory manager.
