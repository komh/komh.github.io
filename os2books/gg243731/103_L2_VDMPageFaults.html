<P>
A page fault exception may occur in a VDM where a particular page in real
memory has been swapped to disk. When a page fault occurs for a linear region
which has been initialized as an<B> alias</B> by a virtual device driver,
the exception is routed to an exception handler, which has been registered
previously by the virtual device driver for the linear address region in
which the page fault occurred. The exception handler may cause the page
to be loaded or may allow the memory reference to default into a temporary
data page, several of which are provided by the MVDM kernel at initialization
time.
<P>
Exception handlers are registered by virtual device drivers at initialization
time using the<B> VDHInstallFaultHook()</B> helper function. If no exception
handler is registered for the linear region in which the page fault occurred,
the page is mapped to temporary data pages in memory.
<P>
The start address and size of each aliased region, and the exception handler
address for each aliased region, is kept in a table, which is set up via
the<B> VDHInstallFaultHook()</B> helper service. When a page fault occurs
in the VDM address space, this table is searched for a matching region,
and the exception handler for that address is called. The page address and
the type of fault which occurred are passed to the exception handler.
