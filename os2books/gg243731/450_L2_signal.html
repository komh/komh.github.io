signal
<P>
An event occurring within the operating system which will effect the execution
of the current process; for example, the user may hit the Ctrl+Break key
combination, which would result in a signal being generated, instructing
the operating system to terminate the current process.  Signals typically
override the dispatching algorithms of the operating system.
