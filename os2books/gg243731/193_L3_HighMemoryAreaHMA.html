<H1>High Memory Area (HMA)</H1><!-- entering slot 216 -->
<P>
VXMS requests that the operating system's memory manager reserve the region
of memory between 1MB and 1MB + 64KB, so that it may use that region for
simulating the A20 address line wraparound.  This region of memory is called
the High Memory Area (HMA).
<P>
When the processor's A20 address line is disabled, the HMA is mapped to
the first 64KB of conventional memory.  When the A20 address line is enabled,
the mapping depends on whether the HMA is in use.  If the A20 address is
not enabled, the HMA is mapped to black hole memory.  Black hole memory
can safely be accessed by a VDM, but values written to it cannot be retrieved
(ROM or invalid physical addresses, for example).  If the HMA is in use,
VXMS requests the memory manager to alias a linear region inside the HMA
to a memory object outside the V86 mode address space, which has been specially
allocated for this purpose.
<P>
DOS Emulation code may reside in the HMA; this is specified by including
the following statement in CONFIG.SYS:
<PRE>DOS=HIGH
</PRE>

<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 installation places this statement into CONFIG.SYS as a
default, and the operating system is thus installed such that DOS Emulation
runs in the HMA. The only drawback to using the HMA for DOS Emulation code
is that applications are prevented from using the HMA.  This is not usually
a serious problem, since few programs require use of the HMA.  It is recommended
that DOS Emulation code is loaded in the HMA as this will free base memory
for application use.
<P>
Note that if XMS size is less than 64KB for a VDM, the HMA is not emulated.
 All requests for the HMA will fail.
