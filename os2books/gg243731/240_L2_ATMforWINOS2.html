<P>
While ATM for OS/2 PM is integrated into the operating system, ATM for WIN-OS/2
is a separate program that is automatically installed into the WIN-OS/2
desktop for you. ATM for WIN-OS/2 is accessed by using the ATM Control Panel
in the WIN-OS/2 Main group. If you plan to manage fonts frequently after
your initial installation it is recommended that you create a program icon
on your OS/2 PM desktop for the WIN-OS/2 ATM control panel. The next section
will describe how to do this.
