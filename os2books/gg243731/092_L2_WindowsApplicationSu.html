<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides the capability for Microsoft Windows applications
to run under OS/2 Version 2.0.  This support allows applications written
for Windows 3.0 and previous versions of Windows (except V1.x) to coexist
with OS/2 and DOS applications under OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
Each Windows application executes in a virtual DOS machine, and is thus
a protected mode process.  As such, Windows applications are subject to
the same application protection facilities provided to other protected mode
processes under OS/2 Version 2.0.  Windows applications are protected from
other Windows applications and from DOS and OS/2 applications executing
in the system.  This is in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment,
where limited protection is provided for Windows 3.0 applications, and none
at all for DOS applications unless Windows is running in enhanced mode.

<P>
The execution of Windows applications as protected mode tasks also allows
these applications to take full advantage of the pre-emptive multitasking
capabilities of OS/2 Version 2.0, with full pre-emptive multitasking between
Windows applications, OS/2 applications, and DOS applications.  This is
again in contrast to the native Windows 3.0 environment, where pre-emptive
multitasking is available only when Windows 3.0 is running in enhanced mode,
thereby impacting performance and preventing many applications written for
previous versions of Windows from executing.  OS/2 Version 2.0 has no such
restriction.
<P>
Windows applications running under OS/2 Version 2.0 will run in a mode equivalent
to the<I> real</I> or<I> standard</I> modes of Windows 3.0; the<I> enhanced
</I>mode of Windows 3.0 is not required since the OS/2 Version 2.0 operating
system itself provides equivalent function.
<P>
Support for Microsoft Windows applications under OS/2 Version 2.0 is discussed
in more depth in <A HREF="210_L1_WindowsApplications.html">Windows Applications</A>.
