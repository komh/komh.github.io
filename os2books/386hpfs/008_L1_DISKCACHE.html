<BR>

<P>
<I>Note:  This entry was written pertaining to LAN Server 2.0, not 3.0.
Still, the DISKCACHE information is interesting.</I>
<P>
With Entry Server 2.0 there is a cache feature that will allow you to allocate
extra memory to caching.  This is the DISKCACHE parameter and it will allow
you to set the size of this cache to a maximum of 14.4MB.  The way DISKCACHE
works is as follows:
<P>
All read requests to an HPFS drive, greater than 2KB and less than or equal
to the DISKCACHE threshold value, are placed in DISKCACHE.  So, DISKCACHE
works in conjunction with HPFS cache accepting data reads greater than 2KB
which is the largest size HPFS cache can accept.  DISKCACHE has two parameters.
 The threshold value and the total memory to set aside for DISKCACHE.  So
the command DISKCACHE=2048, 128 would set the DISKCACHE to 2 Meg and the
maximum size, in sectors, of a read request to 128, which is the threshold.
 So, in short, the LAN Server Entry package does provide additional caching
functionality.
<P>
However, even though the Entry package provides this functionality, the
Advanced Package running on OS/2 1.3 will provide better performance.
<P>
One of the main performance improvements is in the 386 HPFS cache. The 386
HPFS cache has a more intelligent caching algorithm in addition to the following
features:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Performance is enhanced by the use of Busmaster
disk and network device drivers that increase overlap of network and disk
activity.  This function is called scatter/gather and allows devices to
transfer data to and from cache independently of the CPU, hereby increasing
disk and CPU overlap.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The
directory information is also cached.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
DISKCACHE operates with FAT and HPFS when running Entry Server and operates
with only FAT when running the Advanced Server.  DISKCACHE operates with
FAT only with the 1.3 server code.
<P>
CACHE is for HPFS, but will work in conjunction with DISKCACHE on normal
HPFS systems.
