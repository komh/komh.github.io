<P>
When you install the 386 HPFS option, it installs a device driver that automatically
initiates the HPFS partition on which you are installing, to 386 HPFS.  The
data integrity remains the same (a format is not required if the partition
or drive is already formatted HPFS). 
<P>
With OS/2 LAN Server 3.0 Advanced, HPFS drives (other than the install drive)
do not become 386 HPFS drives until the OS/2 LAN Server 3.0 Advanced code
uses/touches that drive.  For example, the HPFS drive will remain simple
HFPS until an alias, a NET SHARE, or access control profile is created on
that drive.  Therefore, a particular partition may not be a 386 HPFS drive
unless you have used that drive in association with OS/2 LAN Server 3.0
Advanced.
<P>
To "make" an existing drive a 386 HPFS drive, try creating an alias for
a resource on it.  If this does not resolve the situation, try running CHKDSK
with the /F parameter on that drive.
<P>
Note that if you need to keep certain partitions FAT or simple HPFS it is
important to not have OS/2 LAN Server 3.0 Advanced deal with that particular
partition (which you are using for another file system).  If the 3.0 system
does use that partition it will become 386 HPFS "formatted" and the other
file system will not be able to utilize that drive again.
