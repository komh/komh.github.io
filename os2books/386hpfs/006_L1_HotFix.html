<P>
With LAN Server 3.0 and 386 HPFS, there is a feature called "Hot Fix", a
segment of the disk is reserved for moving data from faulty disk areas.

<P>
The "hot fix" feature is a part of the HPFS file system, and since 386 HPFS
has the same basic format as HPFS, this feature is also a part of the 386
HPFS file system.  The "hot fix" feature will write data to a reserved part
of a disk when it attempts to write to a bad sector, instead of writing
to the bad sector.  This reserved "hot fix" area takes up approximately
10% of total disk space.
<P>
CACHE386.EXE will report the number of times it has to write to the "hot
fix" area, and thus the number of bad disk sectors since bootup.  Please
note that HPFS and 386 HPFS will remember where bad sectors are, once encountered,
and will not attempt to write to them again.  Because of this CACHE386.EXE
is not an effective tool for discovering how many bad disk sectors are present
on a hard drive.  The data displayed when the user types CACHE386 /stats:d
is only the information since the last reboot, and there is no way to determine
how much of the "hot fix" area has been used is available.
<P>
As far as knowing when a hard drive is going to die, there is not a way
to know, therefore a backup of the drive should always be maintained just
in case.  Unfortunately, the only indication of used "hot fix" area occurs
when you run out of "hot fix" area, which will cause a hard disk crash.
