<H1>Busmaster Adapters & Memory Over 16MB</H1><!-- entering slot 12 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The IBM 16/4 Busmaster Adapter /A is a 24 bit DMA adapter.  As such it attempts
to directly access memory.  Since it is only a 24 Bit adapter, it CANNOT
address memory above the 16 Mb line.  If the advanced server has defined
a cache above the 16 Mb line, the Busmaster adapter /A cannot read that
information.  Thus you will see a number of server failures including hangs.

<P>
This problem is not present with non-busmaster 16/4 Adapter /A's.  The reason
is that these adapters are shared RAM adapters and thus do not access memory
directly.  The Operating System takes care of making all calls to memory.

<P>
In many cases within the server, data is transferred directly from the file
system cache to the network.  If the network adapter cannot address above
16M, then the cache cannot be placed above 16M, since it may have to be
transferred out of it.  This is generally up to the network card device
driver to control, however the USEALLMEM parameter switch may be used to
tell 386 HPFS whether or not to use above 16 MB.
<P>
To have LAN Server v2.0 Advanced or LAN Server v3.0 Advanced use ONLY the
memory below the 16 you need to remove the USEALLMEM parameter from the
HPFS386.IFS line.  This parameter instructs LAN Server to use all memory
in the system when defining Cache.  Without the USEALLMEM parameter, LAN
Server will use only the memory below the 16 Mb line.  Remove this parameter
ONLY on systems with greater than 16 Mb RAM AND an IBM 16/4 Busmaster Adapter
/A.
<P>
The consequence of removing USEALLMEM is that the file cache can't exploit
all of your installed memory.  If you want a file cache larger than about
8 megabytes you will need to use a standard 16/4 adapter (non-busmaster)
or you will need a 32-bit busmaster adapter.
