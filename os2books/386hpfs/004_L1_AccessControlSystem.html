<BR>

<P>
The user IDs, group IDs, and passwords for all users within a server's domain
are stored in a user accounts database (NET.ACC) on the server.  On a LAN
Server-Entry workstation with either the FAT or HPFS file system, the access
control profile information is stored in the NET.ACC file.  On a LAN Server-Advanced
workstation with the 386 HPFS installed, the access control profiles for
the 386 HPFS files and directories are stored within the file system.  This
means:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Every file or directory on an 386 HPFS volume is
anchored on a fundamental file system object called Fnode.  The Fnode is
a fundamental object in an HPFS volume and is the first sector allocated
to a file or directory.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Each
Fnode contains control and access history information used internally by
the file system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The Fnodes
contain a new allocation information about the access control list.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The access control profiles for all other resources (for example, FAT files,
print spooler queues, and serial device queues) and drive-level access control
profiles for 386 HPFS drives are stored in the NET.ACC file.  Up to 8192
access control profiles can be stored in the NET.ACC file.  A 386 HPFS workstation
stores an unlimited number of access control profiles for directories and
files residing on the 386 HPFS drives.
<P>
The access control list consists of different entries, called Access Control
Entries (ACE).  For every access restriction of an ID you can find an entry.
 The entry consists of the user ID or the group and the permission.  The
entries are created when an access profile is crested for a special file
or directory.  Each ACE is sometimes called as Access Control Profile (ACP).

<P>
Inherited Access Control
<P>
For files aliases, an access control profile<I> usually</I> must be created
before users can use this resource.  However, an access control profile
is inherited automatically if the files resource is either created remotely
or resides on an HPFS drive and the 386 HPFS is installed on the server.

<P>
When you create a directory either locally or remotely on a 386 HPFS server,
the newly created directory inherits the access control profile information
of the parent directory.  Because of the way the file allocation table (FAT)
works, you can inherit only a remotely created directory's access control
profile on a FAT file server.  You must have access to the access control
profile on the server to be able to inherit it.  You must be logged on with
an ID that is allowed access to the parent access control profile.  If successful,
a new profile is created with the same permissions as the parent of the
new directory.
<P>
Effects Of Renaming Or Deleting Directories
<P>
If you rename a directory, you must manually delete and recreate any access
control profiles for subdirectories under the directory. Renaming a directory
does not automatically update access control profiles for the subdirectories.
 This only applies to HPFS or FAT file systems.  The 386 HPFS access control
profiles remain with the renamed directory.
<P>
If you delete a directory on a local drive, the associated access control
profile is not deleted.  However, if you delete a directory on a local 386
HPFS drive, the access control profile is deleted.  If you delete the directory
of a redirected drive, the access control profile is always deleted, whether
it is on a local 386 HPFS drive or not.  Check the list of access control
profiles on each server periodically, and delete those that have no existing
files resource.
<P>
Backing Up Access Control Information
<P>
Access control information cannot be copied when backing up systems to tape
because the ACL (access control list) is now in the file node. It is recommended
that the BACKACC utility is used to back up the ACLs in 386 HPFS into a
file and then backup the whole disk using the tape backup program.
