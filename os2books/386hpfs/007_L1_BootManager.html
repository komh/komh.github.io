<P>
If you have a system configured with a startable partition that uses the
386 HPFS (that is, IFS=...HPFS.386...)  with OS/2 1.3 and another startable
partition that uses the OS/2 HPFS (that is, IFS=...HPFS.IFS...), then you
need to understand how the different versions of the HPFS will coexist.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The OS/2 HPFS will not allow the user to access
any directory or file that has an access control profile that was created
using the 386 HPFS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>If you
have installed local security for the 386 HPFS and you have another operating
system that uses the OS/2 HPFS as a startable partition, then your system
will no longer be locally secure.  It is recommended that you create access
control profiles for all the HPFS drives that you do not want accessed when
started with the OS/2 HPFS. However, if you create an access control profile
on a startable partition that uses the OS/2 HPFS instead of the 386 HPFS,
you may not be able to start the operating system on that partition.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
