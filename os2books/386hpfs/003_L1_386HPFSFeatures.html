<BR>

<P>
The 386 HPFS is highly optimized and designed for 80386, 80486 and 80386SX
and 80486SX based platforms with large disk systems.  The 386 HPFS provides
extremely fast access to large disk volumes and optimizes performance in
the server environment, in which many files are open simultaneously.  The
386 HPFS is an enhancement of the regular HPFS which is part of OS/2 Standard
Edition 1.3 or 2.0.  It represents the logical evolution of LAN Server technology.
 The server consists of an optimized ring 0 server tightly coupled with
a bootable Installable File System (IFS) and customized device drivers to
accelerate network I/O.
<P>
The 386-specific version of the HPFS is disk-format compatible with the
OS/2 Standard Edition version.  The existing HPFS partitions do not require
reformatting when 386 HPFS is installed.
<P>
The 386 HPFS of LAN Server V2.0 works only on OS/2 1.30.  Now in LAN Server-Advanced,
386 HPFS is a complete file system running on OS/2 2.0.  The major changes
from LAN Server 2.0 version are the following enhancements:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
