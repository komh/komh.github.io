<P>
Once you isolate MRI from your source code, the next step is to isolate
MRI from the executable module. Usually, the MRI is generated as a DLL (Dynamic
Link Library) and the program will load a proper MRI at runtime by<B> DosLoadModule
</B>API.
<P>
In order to determine in which language MRI should be used, you can utilize
system APIs provided to obtain the runtime information described in <A HREF="024_L3_Determiningruntimeco.html">Determining
runtime code page and country code</A>.
<P>
There are three levels of implementation to determine a language for MRI
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Let a user choose a language at installation
of an application program<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allow a user to choose it at the start-up of
an application program<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Automatically set up the default value based
on the current process code page and allow a user to override it at the
start-up of an application program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The first one is the easiest to implement; the last one gives the widest
freedom to a user but requires the largest effort to implement.<B><I> In
any case, we highly recommend to include English MRI in your program diskettes
in addition to its national-language translation so that a user has an option
to select English MRI.</B></I> This English facility is welcomed by users
working at foreign-capitalized companies operating in Asian countries.
