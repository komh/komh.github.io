<P>
Other utilities such as class browser<B> IBRS.EXE</B> and trace analyzer
<B>IXTRA.EXE</B> have the MRI within their executable modules. Thus, you
can use the SBCS version on the DBCS OS/2. Note that if you have a DBCS
version and run it under the SBCS code page, you would get the garbage,
which would have been DBCS MRI, on your screen.
