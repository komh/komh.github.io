Welcome to the IBM systems with DBCS (Double-Byte Character Set) support
facilities! In Asian countries, such as Korea, Japan, PRC and ROC, where
ideographic characters are widely utilized, handling DBCS characters in
addition to SBCS characters is a fundamental requirement for your programs
to win popularity.  For example, users of your application programs demand
to store DBCS data into data-bases, to see window contents and messages
in their languages or to print reports in DBCS.
<P>
Before we start showing how to write an international application program,
there are a few general things you need to know. Those are covered in this
chapter.
