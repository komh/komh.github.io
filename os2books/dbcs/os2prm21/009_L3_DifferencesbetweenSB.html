<H1>Differences between SBCS OS/2 and DBCS OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│DBCS OS/2 is a common name for OS/2 NLVs (National Language Version)  │
│that IBM provides to the Asia Pacific countries requiring the DBCS    │
│character set. In general, DBCS OS/2 is released following the        │
│release-up of SBCS OS/2.                                              │

<P>
OS/2 aims to be an international operating system, and its SBCS version
has several provision as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DBCS environment vector
<P>
<B>DosQueryDBCSEnv</B><A HREF="051_L0_.html">(**)</A> are used for your
application program to determine whether the program is running on a SBCS
code page or a combined code page. It retunes the DBCS environment vector
of the current process code page to your program. If the program is running
on a SBCS code page, the values of the vector are<I> two bytes of zero</I>.
If it is running on a combined code page, the value shows the reserved areas
for the first byte of DBCS at the current code page.  See <A HREF="023_L3_DeterminingDBCSEnvir.html">DBCS
environmental vector</A> to find the DBCS environment vector for each country.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Mixed string support
<P>
Most of APIs which accept character strings for their parameters can handle
SBCS/DBCS mixed strings.
<P>
Mixed strings can also be used for a file name, a directory name and a path
name.
<P>
All PM controls such as Buttons and List Boxes are DBCS-enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
SBCS OS/2 is the base of DBCS OS/2. Therefore, DBCS OS/2 inherits many things
from SBCS OS/2. In addition, the following capabilities are given to DBCS
OS/2 for DBCS support:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PS/55 hardware<A HREF="052_L0_.html">(**)</A> support

<P>
DBCS OS/2 supports the IBM PS/55 and PS/V keyboards capable of inputting
DBCS, both PS/55 and PS/V displays and printers capable of presenting DBCS.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SBCS character support
<P>
Though DBCS OS/2 is designed for DBCS languages, it supports not only DBCS
but also SBCS. The SBCS code pages for DBCS OS/2 include alphanumeric characters
and special symbols as well as SBCS code pages used on SBCS OS/2.
<P>
The differences between an SBCS code page used on DBCS OS/2 and the one
used on SBCS OS/2 are:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the former reserves code area for the first byte
of DBCS characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the former includes unique phonetic characters used
in DBCS language (in case of Japanese).<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->National use characters are assigned on 5CH and 7EH.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>For more details on the supported code pages on
OS/2, refer to <A HREF="050_L1_Supportedcodepageson.html">Supported code
pages on OS/2 V2.1</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS
input method support
<P>
There are too many ideographic characters to assign to key-tops. This fact
causes DBCS-unique mechanisms to convert SBCS into DBCS for inputting DBCS.
For example,<I> Kana to Kanji conversion method</I> is a DBCS input method
for Japanese.  SBCS-DBCS conversion modules for DBCS input are a part of
DBCS OS/2.
<P>
Although the conversion algorithm is different among Asian countries, the
difference is hidden by PM to an application programs. The application receives
the converted data as well as usual SBCS data so far as it uses PM functions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Messages, menus, and dialog
panels in Asian Languages
<P>
Messages, dialog panels, and menus of OS/2 are translated into Asian languages
for better readability for Asian users.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Font

<P>
Fonts for combined code pages are added to SBCS fonts in order to present
double-byte characters.  In user's DBCS OS/2 environment, more<!-- entering slot 10 --> than
one raster fonts for combined code pages are, at least, installed.  This
is the only one fact you can assume at application programming.<B> Do not
assume anything on the fonts such as face names, various values of font
sizes, or availability of out-line fonts.</B>
<P>
DBCS OS/2 V2.1 provides proportional fonts for combined code pages and short
vector outline fonts. Users can change the default System font to others,
although they cannot do on SBCS OS/2 V2.1.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
