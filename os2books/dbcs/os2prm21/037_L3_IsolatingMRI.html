<H1>Isolating MRI</H1><!-- entering slot 43 -->
<P>
The term<I> MRI isolation</I> has two meanings as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MRI isolation from source code<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MRI isolation from executable module<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The former achieves ease of translation. On the other hand, the latter achieves
MRI switching at runtime. This section describes the former<I> MRI isolation</I>.
The next section will describe the latter case.
<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│Utilize PM facility such as the resource compiler and IPFC to create  │
│MRI so that you can isolate MRI from the source code.                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
Since a translator is not a programmer in general, it is difficult to distinguish
MRI from program codes. Moreover, you need to modify the program whenever
you need to support another language.
<P>
PM provides some facilities to generate program resources as an isolated
module. All resources related to panels (e.g. dialog windows, menus and
strings represented onto the panels) can be stored in a<I> resource file
</I>which can be compiled with the resource compiler. Help resources can
be compiled by IPFC (refer to <A HREF="015_L4_IPFCInformationPrese.html">IPFC
(Information Presentation Facility Compiler)</A>).
<P>
MRI isolation has another merit for version control of your product.  If
your source code contains an MRI information, you need to prepare one source
code per language. If there is a change in logic, you need to reflect the
change to all source codes.
