쿌dd an FCF_DBE_APPSTAT flag to an application window to create a      
쿏BCS-unique status bar for inputting DBCS and to show a keyboard shift
퀂tatus to users.

<P>
An Asian user inputs DBCS using a SBCS-DBCS conversion method.  For example,
a Japanese user inputs phonetic sound of Kanji with alphabet keys and converts
it to Kanji characters. To show the intermediate result of the SBCS-DBCS
conversion, OS/2 needs to open a SBCS-DBCS conversion area. If the SBCS-DBCS
conversion area is opened at the current cursor position, this is called
an<B> on-the-spot conversion</B>.  If the area is opened next to the keyboard
status area, which is located at the bottom of a client window, it is called
a<B> fixed-position conversion</B>.  The on-the-spot conversion is preferred
to the fixed-line conversion, because the user does not need to move his
eyes to the bottom of a client window.
<P>
<B>FCF_DBE_APPSTAT</B> is a DBCS-unique flag to add a DBCS-unique status
line to a PM frame window.  The status line consists of the following three
controls; a keyboard status area, a DBCS conversion area and an  application
status area. The keyboard status area shows whether a user is in a DBCS
mode or a SBCS mode. The DBCS conversion area is used to show the intermediate
result of SBCS-DBCS conversion at the fixed-position DBCS conversion.  In
order to allow a user to input DBCS, an application window needs to have
this frame control flag even if you provide a user with on-the-spot conversion.
Because DBCS OS/2 has a variety of keyboard statuses, we suggest that every
window asking a user to press keys should have this frame control in order
to show a user the current keyboard-shift status.
<P>
On SBCS OS/2,<B> FCF_DBE_APPSTAT</B> is ignored and does not cause any trouble.
