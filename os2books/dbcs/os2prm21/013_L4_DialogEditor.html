<H1>Dialog Editor</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
The dialog editor,<B> DLGEDIT.EXE</B> for SBCS version is equivalent to
the DBCS version except for the MRI. In general, the literals contained
in the dialog templates are translated by the translators and not by the
application programmers. Therefore, what the programmer needs to do is:
conpact.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Check the size of dialogs not to exceed the DBCS-VGA
display.
<P>
Since the size of dialog in the template is represented by dialog unit whose
size is determined at runtime, you can not twll how big the dialog would
be on other environments. Therefore, it is recommended to make dialogs not
to exceed 320 x 213 (h x v)<A HREF="053_L0_.html">(**)</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Add DBCS unique flag<B> FCF_DBE_APPSTAT</B>
<P>
You can specify the flag from the SBCS dialog editor. Select<I> DBCS status
line</I> in the style dialog.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
