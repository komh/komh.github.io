<P>
The IBM OS/2 is an international operating system whose localized editions
are available for Japanese, Korean and Traditional Chinese languages. In
this book we attempt to show you how to support both English and those Asian
languages in a single module under the IBM OS/2 environment. We emphasize
a coding style for writing an international application program by presenting
example programs.
<P>
This book is based on the IBM DBCS OS/2 V2.1 with DBCS OS/2 Extended Services
1.0, and may not be 100% applicable to any other releases.  We intend this
guide primarily for Presentation Manager application programs, although
some of the topics covered in this book are applicable to full-screen and
text-windowed application programs.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This book includes NLS/DBCS-related information on OS/2 V2.1
development environment and samples of 32-bit API usages, but it does not
cover general information on NLS/DBCS support on OS/2 V2.1.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

This book is a sister book of<U><I> DBCS Design Guide and Information for
OS/2 Programming (GA18-7284)</I></U> also available from IBM. We encourage
you to read the guide before reading this book if you are not familiar with
a term 'DBCS' or 'DBCS OS/2'.
