<H1>How to make your Application DBCS-Enabled?</H1><!-- entering slot 23 -->
<P>
In the previous chapter, you have learned the basic knowledge of DBCS on
IBM OS/2 systems.
<P>
The best way to understand how to DBCS-enable your application programs
is to analyze and copy sample DBCS-capable application programs and do some
experimental runs by yourself.  In this chapter, we will show you brief
but typical DBCS-capable application programs so that you can quickly learn
the coding techniques for DBCS-enabling your programs.
