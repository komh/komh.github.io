<H1>MBCS Font Facename and Size</H1><!-- entering slot 97 -->
<P>
The MBCS fonts name does not have practical meaning like in SBCS fonts.
For example, in SBCS fonts, the Courier font is known as the monospace font
and the Times Roman font is known as the most common type used for normal
text.
<P>
The most common MBCS font is the Mincho font. Mincho is one of the most
popular style for Kanji and has a kind of serif.  There are Mincho Proportional,
Mincho System, Mincho (normal) and Mincho terminal font in a DBCS PM. The
Mincho Proportional is a proportional and the rest are monospace fonts.
The next common MBCS font is the Gothic fonts. Gothic font design is more
simple than Mincho, so Gothic fonts can provide smaller font size.
<P>
The font size is also a significant difference between SBCS OS/2 and DBCS
OS/2, especially for a raster font. A DBCS character requires higher resolution
than the SBCS character. For example, in a VGA resolution equivalent device,
the minimum size of SBCS raster font is 6-point, but the minimum size of
DBCS raster font is 8-point. If you try to use a 6-point font in a DBCS
PM, The result is the requested font not found and the system default font
is applied as the alternative.
