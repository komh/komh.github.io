<P>
The following are hints to prepare test case/data.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Include the DBCS characters whose second bytes have
the same code points as the SBCS character significant to your program.
Confirm that your program does not confuse those second bytes with such
SBCS characters.  For example, if your program searches for the path delimiter,
5CH, prepare the file name containing the DBCS character whose second byte
is 5CH and confirm that your program does not confuse that second byte with
the pass delimiter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select critical characters which are encoded around
the DBCS range. The following shows some cases of them:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Both 1) the DBCS characters whose second bytes are
in the range of DBCS first byte and 2) ones whose second bytes are in SBCS
code range<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For Japanese,<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->Both the DBCS characters whose first bytes are
in range 81H through 9FH and ones whose first bytes are in range E0H through
FCH<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->Both the SBCS characters in range 20H through
7FH and ones in range A1H through DFH<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Some
Korea DBCS characters are encoded in the Japanese SBCS characters area.
 This kind of test data can be used to make sure that a program is DBCS
enabled without hard-coding the DBCS code range.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
