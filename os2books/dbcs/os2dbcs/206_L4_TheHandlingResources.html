<H1>The Handling Resources</H1><!-- entering slot 213 -->
<P>
A simple example of the handling resource is the DBCS code range table.
A DBCS code page has the DBCS code range with pairs of values in the DBCS
environment vector, but the SBCS code page has the DBCS code range with
one pair of values (0, 0). If an application handles all the code page,
SBCS and DBCS, by checking the code range table, then it need only one logic
for both.
<P>
A well designed application program should prepare the resources for all
the code pages supported, and a default resource for the code pages which
are not supported by the application in case it runs on such code pages.
Some applications allow users to select the resource by themselves. However,
the application program needs to display warning message to its user when
a code page which is not supported is selected.
