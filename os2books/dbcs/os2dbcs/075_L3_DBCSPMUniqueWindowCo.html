<H1>DBCS PM Unique Window Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
As described in <A HREF="063_L4_FrameControls.html">Frame Controls</A>,
there are four DBCS PM unique window controls. They are used by the DBCS
keyboard and input method and are created to the frame window or dialog
box that request an input queue. The FCF_DBE_APPSTAT flame window style
locates them in the bottom of the frame window or dialog box.  Otherwise,
they are not displayed until the input method wants to use them.
<P>
Application can get the control or handling of them. To do this, application
must get the window handle of them by the following ID:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Keyboard Status Area (<B>FID_DBE_KBDSTAT</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Predefined Edit Control for Input Conversion (<B>FID_DBE_PECIC</B>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Application Status Area (<B>FID_DBE_APPSTAT</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Normally, application program gets the window handles of these
window controls to change their window parameters.  For example, if an editing
text has font size 24, the on-the-spot YOMI buffer should share the same
size. Currently, the default font size of the on-the-spot YOMI buffer has
a same size as the system default font.
