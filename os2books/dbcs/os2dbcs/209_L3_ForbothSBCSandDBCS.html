<P>
If you provide different editions of your program in order to support different
environments such as SBCS, DBCS and different code pages, duplicate effort
will be required not only in development but also in maintenance, and distribution
cost of NLS support will be increased. To save the work load, an application
program is recommended to provide single module with multiple resources.
