<P>
OS/2 provides the kernel debugger to customer from version 2.0.  Actually,
the kernel debugger is built in the same time the OS/2 system kernel is
built. Therefore, each OS/2 kernel need the corresponding kernel debugger.
The kernel debugger is included in the OS/2 programming toolkit package,
a separated product of OS/2 product family. The kernel debugger of each
national language version is also included in the national language version
of the OS/2 programming toolkit package.
<P>
Besides the kernel debugger, there are several symbol files that is created
with modules provided by OS/2 System for debugging purpose. These symbol
files are also included in the OS/2 programming toolkit package. If a CSD
(Customer Service Disk) or PTF (Program Temporary Fixed) package are installed,
some symbol files (*.SYM) are required for using the kernel debugger in
the system. Normally, these symbol files are included in the CSD or PTF
package. The old symbol files can no longer be used.
<P>
The monitor program for the kernel debugger can be used for any national
language version of OS/2.  Any terminal application program that receives
data from RS232C can be the monitor program for the kernel debugger.
