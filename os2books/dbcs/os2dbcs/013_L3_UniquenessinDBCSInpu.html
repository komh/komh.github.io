<P>
Although special system-input mechanisms, device drivers and hardware are
necessary to handle the large number of distinct characters, usually applications
need not be concerned with how the operator keys in a character, how the
keystrokes get converted to DBCS characters, or how the very large set of
character fonts are managed. However, you need to be aware that the handling
of SBCS/DBCS mixed string data for input, processing, and output to displays/printers
is a major programming consideration for DBCS support.  The following chapters
will show the details of how to reflect these considerations in designing
your DBCS support.
