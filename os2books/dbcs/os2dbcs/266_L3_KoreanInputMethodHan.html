<H1>Korean Input Method - Hangeul-to-Hanja Conversion</H1><!-- entering slot 273 -->
<P>
The Hanja characters or Chinese characters are used in the Korean language.
The Korean input method is the Hangeul-to-Hanja Conversion. The Hangeul
characters are the pronunciation of the Hanja, so the relationship between
Hangeul and Hanja in the Hangeul-to-Hanja conversion is similar to that
between YOMI(Kana) and Kanji in Japanese Kana-to-Kanji conversion.  The
user input the Hangeul character first, and press the convert key to get
the Hanja candidate string, and press the enter key to fix the result Hanja
character. When users press the Hanja key to get into the input method mode,
the keyboard mode can be any mode that the system supports. but in default,
it is set to Hangeul mode by the input method logic.
<P>
Korea input method also provides a function called Current Cursor Position
Conversion. This function allows the user to move the cursor to a Hangeul
character in a text or screen, and convert this Hangeul character into a
Hanja character like the normal Hangeul-to-Hanja conversion process.
