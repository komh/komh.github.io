<P>
The only data type, which allows mixed SBCS and DBCS string, in the source
code of C language is the literal data type. All the C compilers can handle
the literal with mixed SBCS and DBCS string. But in SBCS environment, if
the last character of the literal, inside two double quotation mark("),
is a DBCS character whose second byte is 0x5C, then the compiler can not
recognize the literal and compiling error occur. To avoid this problem,
most compilers are designed CP-dependent or provide a compile option.
<P>
Some C compiler products provide some DBCS libraries in their NLVs. However,
in order to keep the portability of the source code, those DBCS libraries
are not recommended.
