<P>
To develop applications (like the order entry program in the previous section),
the following types of products may be used and DBCS supports of them ease
applications' DBCS support.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Presentation Service products<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Database Management products<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Programming language compilers
<P>
This section talks about a hypothetical programming language compiler.  To
ease development of applications supporting DBCS as explained in the previous
section and/or to be appreciated by non-English speaking programmers, our
hypothetical programming language compiler should support DBCS in the following
items:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PII
<P>
The following should be DBCS-enabled and provided in national languages:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Compiler messages<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Text portions of compile list such as titles<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Panels (for example, you may support interactive
debugger, which has screen user interface)<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Text
data
<P>
Comments can be categorized in this group.  Programmers writing in their
national language, need SBCS/DBCS mixed strings.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Name
data for communication between the system and the user (or name data for
the system to identify system resources)
<P>
Variable name, label and procedure name are categorized here and DBCS support
for them is desired for better readability and self-documentation of source
code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Fields and items for
any kind of data
<P>
Character data type variables should contain any kind of data, including
text and name.  Since text and names require DBCS support, the character
data type should support SBCS/DBCS mixed strings.
<P>
DBCS data type (or graphic data type) accepts only DBCS characters (and
does not contain SO/SI even in EBCDIC environment).  It is supported by
many products in S/390 such as program languages and database manager.  For
SAA the DBCS data type has been introduced into the PC world.
<P>
Consequently, the following supports are required for the character data
type and the DBCS data type:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Literal
<P>
Enhance character string literals to support SBCS/DBCS mixed string.  DBCS
string literal (or G-type literal) support should be added.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->String manipulations, such as SUBSTRING, truncation,
etc.
<P>
Enhance character string manipulation functions to support SBCS/DBCS mixed
string, and DBCS string manipulation functions should be added.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->I/O (terminal I/O, file I/O, printing)
<P>
Enhance I/O functions so that the enhanced character strings and the additionally
supported DBCS strings can be handled correctly.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Since the source code may contain DBCS in comments, literal and/or DBCS
name, the parser of your compiler should be enhanced so that it does not
confuse the second bytes of DBCS characters with a delimiter and so on,
which are significant to your parser.
