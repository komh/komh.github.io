<P>
The MBCS outline fonts are supported in the same manner as SBCS outline
fonts. However, the MBCS outline fonts have different font face names than
raster fonts. Two types of MBCS outline fonts are provided in DBCS PM. They
are the short vector outline fonts and the ATM outline fonts. These two
types of DBCS outline fonts are different on the face name and installation
method. See the <A HREF="094_L4_AvailableFontsinDBCS.html">Available Fonts
in DBCS PM</A>.
<P>
Comparing to the SBCS outline fonts, the DBCS outline fonts have a big volume
of data. Therefore, they may not always be loaded to the system because
of memory constraint. Sometimes, they are not even installed to the system.
