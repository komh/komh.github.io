<P>
After typing the pronunciation of a sentence or sentences, the user presses
a key to initiate the conversion of the pronunciation string into the desired
Kanji characters.  Once initiated, the conversion routine of OS/2 first
breaks down the input into several phrases.  Then it replaces each phrase
with one of candidates which have the same pronunciation.  The candidate
is extracted from the dictionary file which contains information on correspondences
between pronunciations and Kanji characters. The result may be incorrect
because there can be several ways to break down a sentence or several DBCS
strings with the same pronunciation.  The user therefore may have to edit
this intermediate result to get the desired Kanji characters.
<P>
The conversion routine display intermediate results in the<B> WC_DBE_PECIC
</B>control.  Your program does not need to update the contents of this
control.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This is for<I> fixed-position conversion</I>. Usually the
on-the-spot conversion is preferred to the fixed-position conversion because
it requires less eye movement. For information about how to support on-the-spot
conversion, refer to <A HREF="069_L4_OnTheSpotConversioni.html">On-The-Spot
Conversion in DBCS PM</A>
