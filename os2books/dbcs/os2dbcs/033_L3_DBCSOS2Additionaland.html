<H1>DBCS OS/2 Additional and Unique Function</H1><!-- entering slot 35 -->
<P>
DBCS OS/2, a natural extension of SBCS OS/2, has additional functions of
SBCS OS/2 to support DBCS. DBCS OS/2 adds the following supports for DBCS:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DBCS Hardware Support
<P>
DBCS hardware is the peripheral hardwares, for example display, printer
keyboard.  Following are the DBCS hardware requirements:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->To display the complicated DBCS characters, the display
device, both display adapter card and display unit, must have a high resolution.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If possible, the display device should provide a
built-in DBCS font image data to enhance the performance in displaying the
DBCS characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The DBCS printer supports the DBCS printer data stream
and some have built in DBCS font data.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The DBCS characters require more keys to allow the
user in data input task. The DBCS keyboards are designed to satisfy this
requirement.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> The SBCS OS/2 can support the DBCS
hardware with only the SBCS capability. The DBCS OS/2 supports the DBCS
hardware with the DBCS capability. The DBCS OS/2 from 2.1 also supports
various types of DBCS keyboards of OEM in each country as well as the 101
keyboard of PS/2 which is not originally designed for the DBCS personal
system.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Data Type Support

<P>
The<I> character</I> data type is enhanced to support mixed strings and
DBCS strings in Database Manager.  The single-line entry-field control of
Presentation Manager is enhanced to filter user input to an SBCS string,
a mixed string or a DBCS string.  Details of the support in each OS/2 component
are explained in the relevant sections of <A HREF="132_L1_Database.html">Database
</A>,<A HREF="055_L1_Presentation.html">Presentation</A>. The data type
support is common to all the DBCS countries.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS
Support File System
<P>
The file system is enhanced to allow the file name to include DBCS characters.
 However the DBCS alphanumeric characters are treated as a two-byte data,
and do not have the limitation of using the invalid symbols or uppercasing
handling for them when use them in a file name.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a file is created on a DBCS environment with a name including
DBCS characters,  then it can not be recognized on an SBCS environment.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> You cannot use DBCS characters as the file name punctuation
characters such as period separating the file name from the extension, the
path delimiter (backslash) in the path name and the colon in the drive specifier.
 (See also <A HREF="020_L4_SBCSPCCodeforEachDBC.html">SBCS PC Code for Each
DBCS Language</A> regarding the path delimiter.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS
Font Management
<P>
The DBCS OS/2 provides DBCS font to the combined code page OS/2 screen section.
 The system default font of the DBCS PM is also a DBCS font.
<P>
DBCS OS/2 additionally supports DBCS OS/2-unique API to load combined code
page fonts; and each country's edition supports its unique font resources.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> DBCS OS/2 supports the font loading API calls that SBCS OS/2
does, such as<B> GpiLoadFonts</B>. However, these APIs do not support all
the combined code page fonts. The combined code page raster fonts are supported
by the font drivers. DBCS OS/2 provides the DBCS unique load and unload
APIs for the font drivers. When a font driver is loaded, the combined code
page fonts that are provided by this font driver will become available.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Country Code and Code Page
Support Each DBCS OS/2 NLV supports only one country code, and 3 to 4 code
pages. The primary code page must be a combined code page. The OS/2 system
commands or utilities check the environment code page to provide appropriate
messages and data format.  For example, the DIR commend will display Japanese
message in code page 932 but display English message in code page 437; the
SYSTEM EDITOR will display the Japanese editor window when it is executed
from a 932 OS/2 command prompt but display the English editor window when
it is executed from a 437 OS/2 command prompt.
<P>
DBCS countries' code page support for devices (such as display, keyboard
and printer) is<!-- entering slot 36 --> added in DBCS OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS
Keyboard and Input Method Support
<P>
The keyboard is enhanced to allow the user to input the DBCS characters
from the keyboard input device.
<P>
As there are too many DBCS characters to assign each one to a key-top, a
special input method is required and it is called<I> DBCS input method</I>.
 Each country's edition of DBCS OS/2 provides a DBCS input method specifically
to that country as a standard feature.  (For example, Japanese OS/2 supports
<I>Kana to Kanji Conversion Method</I>.) Usually applications do not take
care of the conversion process.  This is done within DBCS OS/2 and is not
recognized by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS
Text Format Support
<P>
DBCS OS/2 provides text punctuation function support such as the word wrap
and line breaking handling. The<B> WinDrawText</B> of SBCS OS/2 does not
support text formatting of Asian countries, but DBCS OS/2 does.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Translated
Messages and Panels
<P>
Messages and panels of each country's edition of DBCS OS/2 are translated
into its own language.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
