<P>
If there are field attributes or protected fields in the target area, DBCS
EHLLAPI will skip the same length of bytes in the source string as SBCS
EHLLAPI does. You may utilize this fact to copy strings to multiple fields
by one<B> COPY STRING TO PS</B> call. But such usage could cause problems
with DBCS since DBCS characters may be bisected by the byte skip or may
try to be copied to an SBCS field (or vice versa).
