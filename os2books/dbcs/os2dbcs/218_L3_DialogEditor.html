<P>
The dialog editor DLGEDIT.EXE is DBCS supported utility. Although there
are DBCS versions of this utility, but the difference are only in the PII,
the NLS messages and panels for the DBCS users. The dialog templates that
created by the dialog editor can include DBCS unique window controls, the
keyboard status line. Following shows the considerations of using the SBCS
DLGEDIT.EXE utility:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run it in the DBCS OS/2
<P>
If you run it in a SBCS OS/2, then the DBCS character will not be handled
correctly during the editing process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run it in the VGA mode of DBCS OS/2
<P>
The VGA mode is the smallest resolution screen of the display device that
supported by the DBCS OS/2.  If you run it in a bigger screen, then you
may create a dialog which has a size bigger than the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select the DBCS status line
<P>
In the style dialog of the DLGEDIT.EXE, there is an option to set for the
DBCS status line.  This selecting will add the status line to the dialog
you create.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
