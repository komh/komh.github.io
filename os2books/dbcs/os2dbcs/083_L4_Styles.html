<P>
Although single line entry field control has style<B> ES_SBCS</B>,<B> ES_DBCS</B>,
<B>ES_MIXED</B> and<B> ES_ANY</B>, the multi-line entry field control does
not support those styles. Therefore, if an application needs to filter the
user input to SBCS only or DBCS only, or needs to cope with the code scheme
differences between ASCII and EBCDIC mixed strings, the application has
to manage the problems by itself.
