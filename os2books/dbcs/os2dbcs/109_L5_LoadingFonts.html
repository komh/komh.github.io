<P>
A<I> private font</I> is the font which is available only to the application
that explicitly loads it.  The following functions can be used for SBCS
fonts but not for MBCS raster fonts in DBCS OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
As stated before, you query the system what fonts are available and find
a font that best satisfies your requirement rather than assume the existence
of some specific font.
<P>
As we already discussed in <A HREF="094_L4_AvailableFontsinDBCS.html">Available
Fonts in DBCS PM</A>, the MBCS raster fonts are provided by the font drivers
that own the fonts.  DBCS PM provides APIs (WinDBCSLoadFontDriver, WinDBCSUnloadFontDriver....)
for application to load/unload a font driver.  After the font driver is
loaded, the fonts of this font driver will become the private fonts to the
application program.

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The structure and format of the MBCS font driver
is not publicized  The MBCS font driver mechanism is changing and becoming
close to SBCS font mechanism.  For example, the MBCS outline font for version
1.2 was supported by font driver, but from late version of 1.3 and now up
to the current version, MBCS outline fonts are supported in a same mechanism
as SBCS font.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In version 1.x, user can load MBCS fonts as well
as SBCS fonts using the PM Control Panel. In version 2.x user can use the
font driver object to load MBCS raster font drivers, and use the font palette
object to load the SBCS fonts and the MBCS outline fonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
