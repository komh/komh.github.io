<P>
Country code is defined in the OS/2 system.  You can find the statement
in the CONFIG.SYS file of an OS/2 system. It is an incorrect idea to check
the country code and decide if the current environment supports DBCS or
not. OS/2 supports a primary code page and a secondary code page with one
country code.  In DBCS OS/2, the primary must be a DBCS code page and the
secondary code page can be an SBCS or a DBCS codes page.  Therefore you
can not tell the current code page is an SBCS code page or a DBCS code page
by a given country code.  You can check if the code page is supported in
a given country code by an OS/2 API, DosQueryCtryInfo. The country information
resides in the COUNTRY.SYS file.
<P>
In personal system software, DOS or OS/2, a system value called DBCS environment
vector is provided to application program to check out if the current environment
support DBCS or not. Actually, this value is the DBCS first byte code range
of the DBCS characters that are provided in the current using character
set.  If this value is 00, this means there are not DBCS character in the
current character set, or the current character set is an SBCS character
set. You can get the DBCS environment vector value by an OS/2 API, DosQueryDBCSEnv
(32 bit API) or DosGetDBCSEnv (16 bit API not supported from version 2.0).
