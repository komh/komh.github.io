<P>
The information resources can include the code page information. There are
two kinds of code page for an IPF document:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The code page of the document
<P>
This code page is defined by specifying the country and code page compile
option when the document is compiled. When the document is viewed by the
VIEW.EXE utility, there are two cases. If the document is compiled without
code page specified, then the VIEW will display the document by the current
code page of the environment; else VIEW.EXE utility will display the document
by the code page of the document.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The code page of a chapter or section of the document

<P>
This code page is defined inside the document IPF source by the :font. tag
with the code page specified. This code page is for the chapter of section
that has the tag statement. When the document is viewed by the VIEW.EXE
utility, the chapter or section that has code page specified is displayed
by that code page, other parts of the document are display by the code page
of the document.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some block characters or graphic characters are the first byte codes of
some DBCS characters.  Therefore the IPFC file that was created in SBCS
code page environment may not be displayed correctly in a combined code
page environment.  To solve this problem on OS/2 2.0 version, you can specify
the SBCS code page when you compile the file, or specify the code page inside
the document.  If you want to use the block characters in a DBCS page, then
you have to use the defined symbol characters, like &amp;Lt. &amp;Rt., and
make sure that you are using the correct code page version of APSYMBOL.APS
file.
