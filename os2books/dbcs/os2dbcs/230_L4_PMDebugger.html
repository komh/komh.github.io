<P>
In case of the PM Debugger,<B> IPMD.EXE</B>, you would use SBCS PM Debugger
on DBCS environment to debug your program on the real DBCS environment.
In such case, you need to change the process code page to SBCS code page
with<I> CHCP</I> or<I> CHGCP</I> command. However, if you need to debug
program portion related to the process code page, e.g. logic for loading
appropriate MRI or DBCS character input, this might disturb you in debugging.
You need DBCS version to debug such portion.<A HREF="276_L0_.html">(**)
