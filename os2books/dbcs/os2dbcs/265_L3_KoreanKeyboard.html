<H1>Korean Keyboard</H1><!-- entering slot 272 -->
<P>
Like the Japanese keyboard, the Korea keyboard has the following keyboard
modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Alphanumeric Mode
<P>
This is to input the Alphanumeric characters. The Alphanumeric mode is exclusive
with Hangeul mode and Jamo mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Jamo Mode
<P>
User can input Jamos in this mode.  In Korean language, the Jamos are mainly
used to compose the Hangeul character, actually a Jamo is a part or a component
of a Hangeul character. The Jamo mode is exclusive with Alphanumeric mode
and Hangeul mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Hangeul Mode
<P>
User can input the Hangeul characters in this mode.  When keyboard is in
this mode, a conversion logic called (Jamo to) Hangeul Composition logic
is invoked.  The Hangeul Composition logic get the inputted Jamo characters
combination to compose the Hangeul characters.  During the composition process,
the incomplete Hangeul character is called Interim Hangeul character or
simply the Interim character. The Hangeul mode is exclusive with Alphanumeric
mode and Jamo mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SBCS or DBCS Mode
<P>
When keyboard is in DBCS mode, characters typed in are all DBCS characters.
When keyboard is in SBCS mode, characters typed in are SBCS characters.
However, there are only DBCS Hangeul character set in combined code page
934 and 944, so even in SBCS mode, the Hangeul characters typed in is DBCS
characters. The Jamos in combined code page 949 are included in only DBCS,
so the inputted Jamos in SBCS mode are DBCS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
