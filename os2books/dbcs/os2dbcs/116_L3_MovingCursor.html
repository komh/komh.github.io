<P>
The following explains the rules you should follow when you move the cursor
around in the text.  The basic rule is:  do not locate the text cursor at
the second byte of any DBCS character if you support the<I> character-based
operation</I>.  See <A HREF="047_L3_ByteBasedOperationor.html">Byte-Based
Operation or Character-Based Operation</A> for discussion on the character
based operation and<I> byte-based operation</I>.
<P>
To know whether a certain byte is the second byte of a DBCS character or
not:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Applications need to maintain information like bit
0 and 7 of the above by themselves.  See also <A HREF="027_L3_HowToUseBothDBCSandS.html">How
To Use Both DBCS and SBCS in a String</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
