<H1>Extended Code Pages</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
The coded character sets that have<I> Extended</I> in their names have been
defined for SAA, extending the existing PC and host code pages. By adding
the characters that exist only in the corresponding host code page to a
PC code page, and vice versa, they have the character set now common to
the host and PC code pages within one country so that no characters will
be lost in communication between systems.  Therefore, these code pages are
important and strategic, especially for distributed or cooperative processing.
 These code pages are called<I> extended code pages</I>.
<P>
In <A HREF="016_L4_CharacterSetandCodeP.html">GCSGIDs and CPGIDs for each
DBCS National Language</A>, each extended code page is listed just under
its base code page.  Each extended code page is an exact superset of it's
base code page, except<I> Japanese(Latin) Extended</I>.<I> Vertical Line,
Broken</I> does not exist in<I> Japanese(Latin) Extended</I> code page but
in its base code page,<I> US English</I>.  The following are the code points
added for the PC extended code pages.<B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
