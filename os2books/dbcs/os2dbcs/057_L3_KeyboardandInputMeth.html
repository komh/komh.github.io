<P>
In order to let a user input the DBCS characters from a keyboard, the DBCS
system provides the DBCS keyboard functions and the input method functions.
The DBCS keyboard allows the user to type in the DBCS characters from the
keyboard, and the input methods allow the user to convert some DBCS characters
(e.g Kana character) into some other DBCS characters (e.g. Kanji, Chinese
character).
<P>
In English, there are alphabets, numerals and symbols. Most of them can
be typed in from the keyboard by one single key stroke or one key stroke
with a shift key.
<P>
In Chinese based languages, (Chinese, Korean and Japanese) beside the alphanumeric
characters, there are additional characters defined as DBCS characters.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> You do not have to read all the explanations in this section
if you already know what a DBCS keyboard and a DBCS input method look like.
 However, the <A HREF="061_L3_KeyboardandInputMeth.html">Keyboard and Input
Methods in DBCS PM</A> and <A HREF="070_L3_WM_CHAR.html">WM_CHAR</A> are
recommended, because they tell you what to do with the DBCS keyboard in
the DBCS PM.
