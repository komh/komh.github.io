Before version 2.0, DBCS OS/2 supported only the PS/55 adapters that provide
higher resolution than VGA.  From version 2.0, the DBCS OS/2 supports more
display devices with various resolutions. Application programs need not
to be aware of the different display devices, but must aware the different
resolutions. The following table shows the pel size of different display
device, the PS/55 DA/2, VGA, SVGA and XGA.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The difference between the resolutions will affect your code relating with
<I>pels</I>, such as window coordinates.  Take a look at the following example.
 This is a main window appearing in the center of the screen of the VGA
display:
<PRE>WinSetWindowPos( hwndFrame,                 HWND_TOP,
                 220, 140, 200, 200,
                 SWP_SIZE | SWP_MOVE | SWP_ACTIVATE | SWP_SHOW
               );
</PRE>

<P>
On PS/55 DA/2, however, it is not in the center any longer.  If the initial
position of a window is important, use a scale factor, which is varied according
to the resolution of the current display, to give the window an appropriate
position.
<P>
You can use the<B> DevQueryCaps</B> call to know the resolution of the current
device. For example:
<PRE>HDC hdc;
ULONG devcaps[2];

hwndFrame = WinCreateStdWindow(
             HWND_DESKTOP,
             0L,
             (PULONG)&amp;flCreate,
             "MyWindow",
             "",
             0L,
             NULL,
             ID_WINDOW,
             (PHWND)&amp;hwndClient
             );

hdc = WinOpenWindowDC( hwndFrame);

DevQueryCaps( hdc,
              CAPS_WIDTH,
              2L,
              devcaps);
</PRE>

<P>
After returning from the<B> DevQueryCaps</B> call, the first and second
elements of the array<B> devcaps</B> contain the horizontal resolution and
the vertical resolution of the current display device respectively.  Using
these values, you can calculate proper coordinate values for the window
position parameters of<B> WinSetWindowPos</B> call.
<P>
The above consideration is not DBCS unique.  It is also applicable to the
8514/A,VGA and XGA version of your program.  It is recommended to make a
program device-independent; This will help you when new devices come out.
