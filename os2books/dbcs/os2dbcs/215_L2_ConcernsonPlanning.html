Although the following are not related to DBCS support directly, it is recommended
that you consider them:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Product Name
<P>
Check if the name of your product is acceptable and valid in the country
you are planning to sell.  If someone or a certain company has already registered
or secured the same name, you will not be able to use your current product
name.  In such case, you will be requested to change your product name.
 This change requires not only the name on your product package but also:

<UL>Stage
of Retrofitting
<P>
It will be worth considering, while in the retrofitting stage of your product,
if your product is an application for people like physicians or pilots,who
are usually familiar with English. Your product may be acceptable with English
menus and messages even in DBCS required countries.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Terms
and Conditions of your product
<P>
If your product is going to be sold under a certain T &amp; C agreement
with a user, you are requested not only to translate the current T &amp;
C statements but also to use appropriate terms.  Consult a lawyer in the
country in which you are planning on selling.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Country-unique
regulations, business customs and culture differences
<P>
There may be a requirement to conform to country-unique regulations, for
example, a communications protocol which is owned by the local company or
government or support country-unique business customs and cultural differences.
