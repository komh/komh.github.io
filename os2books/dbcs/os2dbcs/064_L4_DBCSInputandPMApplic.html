<P>
You do not have to understand the input method itself for you to support
DBCS in your program.  Your application can receive the result of a conversion
through<B> WM_CHAR</B> or from an entry field control.  Your application
does not need to intervene in the conversion process.
<P>
All that's necessary is to set the<B> FCF_DBE_APPSTAT</B> frame control
flag when your window or dialog box needs to accept text containing DBCS
characters.
