<P>
As of 12/93, version 3.0 of OS/2 LAN server is available for each DBCS languages
(Japanese, Korean and T-Chinese). It supports the conventional IBM PC code
page (944) and KS (949) for Korean system. Basically NLVs are translated
versions of the base product and provide the same functions and product
packaging including DOS LAN requester.
<P>
Regarding Multi-language environment discussed in <A HREF="042_L2_ConsiderationsforLan.html">Considerations
for Languages</A>, DBCS versions of LAN server and LAN requester are implemented
based on the assumption that the same language is used among their LAN system.
