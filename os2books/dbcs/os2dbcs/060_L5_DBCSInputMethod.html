<H1>DBCS Input Method</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
The DBCS keyboard system provides the DBCS input method, a conversion logic,
for the character sets which can not be typed in from the keyboard with
one or two key strokes. Normally, the input methods are used to input the
Chinese characters, Kanji or Hanja characters.  There are different kinds
of input methods, but they all work in a similar operation.  The following
shows a typical input method process:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A user inputs one or numbers of SBCS or DBCS characters
to form a combination of characters.  This is called the YOMI or a pronunciation
string.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The YOMI string then is converted to a candidate of
target string or a list of candidates.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A user selects the one he/she wants. This is done
to fix the candidate.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A user can request for the next candidate if the first
candidate is not the one he/she wants.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A user can request the input method to show all the
candidates as a list.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Depending on the location of YOMI string, there are two styles of input:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the keyboard status line
<P>
The keyboard status line is used to show the current status of the keyboard
and input method.  Moreover, it is also used to show the input method conversion
status, the YOMI string and candidates or error message.  The early version
of input method supported this style only.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the spot
<P>
When the user is typing, the YOMI string is located in the same position
of the current cursor position.  This style is supported in most input methods
today.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
