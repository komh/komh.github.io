<P>
In an application program development process, there are several phases
for functional testing. Depending on the development process you adopt,
the phases may be different, but basically there are two major phases to
validate DBCS.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The FVT Phase (Functional Verification Test)
<P>
This phase test to validate the enabled DBCS functions for the product.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The SVT (System Verification Test ) and PVT (Packaging
Verification Test) phase
<P>
This phase is the final test to validate DBCS through out the system for
the software product.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Translation Verification test can be performed separately from these functional
testing so far as PII is well isolated from logic code, but should be done
by the native national language speaker.
