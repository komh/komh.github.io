<H1>System Default Font Can Be Selected</H1><!-- entering slot 108 -->
<P>
From DBCS OS/2 version 2.0, the system default font can be selected by end
user from the Font Driver Object.  This object is located in the System
Setup folder of the System Folder. It is a notebook setup utility that provides
the function to load/unload an MBCS raster font driver and sets up the new
system default font. A user can select a default font from a list of MBCS
fonts and select the face name and font size of the font. This font will
become the system default font from the next IPL. The MBCS fonts that can
be selected as the system default font are limited. Currently they are the
fonts that are provided by the font driver PMNLSFD1.FDR and PMNLSFD3.FDR.
 See  <A HREF="095_L5_AvailableRasterFonts.html">Font Drivers and their
fonts in OS/2 J2.0</A> for font driver information.
<P>
Normally, the system default font of a DBCS PM after the system installation
is set to 12 point in size. After that, depending on the end user's preference,
they can be selected from various choices. So an application program must
check the current font size even you do not change the font size in your
program.
