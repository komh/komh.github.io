<H1>Full Screen General Editor</H1><!-- entering slot 42 -->
<P>
In this section, we are going to see where our hypothetical full screen
general editor should support DBCS.  An example of uses is non-English speaking
programmers writing programs containing DBCS in comments, literals or variable
names.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PII
<P>
As this category, the following should be DBCS-enabled and provided in national
languages.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Messages<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Help panels<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Text portions of the panels, such as<I> Top of File</I>,
<I>Bottom of File</I>, the status line (for example,<I> Line n - Column
n - Insert mode</I>) and function key area<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Name
data for communication between the system and the user (or name data for
the system to identify system resources)
<P>
You should support DBCS file/extension name, for example, in FILE and SAVE
command. (As explained before, OS/2 supports mixed string in file/extension
name.)
<P>
If your editor supports a command which assigns a symbolic name to a line
so that other commands can refer to this line by the name, allow the user
to choose a name that can be easily memorized it usually in his national
language.
<P>
Accelerator keys, such as Alt-J to join, Alt-B to mark a block and Alt-C
to copy a marked area, may be difficult to memorize for non-English speaking
people. Therefore, customization capability of the key assignments is desired.

<P>
By the same reason, mnemonic keys should also be customizable. Japanese
OS/2 support alternate mnemonics.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Fields
and items for any kind of data
<P>
The hypothetical editor is a general editor.  So, the editing area should
accept any kind data including texts and names.  This area should support
DBCS input and DBCS display (DBCS presentation).
<P>
Consequently, some commands should support DBCS in their arguments.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
