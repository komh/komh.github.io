<P>
When you design string manipulation functions such as<B> SUBSTR</B>, there
could be two alternatives for<I> length</I> and<I> position</I> parameters
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>byte-counting</B> (or<B> byte-numbering</B>)
<P>
This approach fits current computer systems since many things such as buffer
length and field length are defined in byte-counting and physically limited
by byte length.  However, bisection of DBCS characters may occur and you
should take care of the bisected characters as explained in the following
sections.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>character-counting</B> (or<B> character-numbering</B>)

<P>
The merits and demerits of this approach are just the opposite of the byte-counting.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
