<H1>Proportional DBCS Font</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
Before the DBCS OS/2 2.0 version, there are only monospace MBCS fonts. Application
programs may have assumed the MBCS fonts are always monospace fonts and
handled the font size without taking care of the average character width
value. From DBCS OS/2 2.0, the proportional MBCS fonts are supported, (actually
the fonts data for SBCS characters are proportional and fonts for DBCS characters
are fixed pitch) and becomes the system default font. This change affected
the applications that did not handle the font correctly in 1.x version.
