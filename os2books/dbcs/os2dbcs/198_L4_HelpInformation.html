<P>
When incorrect operation is done or help information is requested from the
user, application program needs to provide the help information to its user.
An application program may provide its own help function or it can use the
system provides help function.  For example the IPF utility or message file
mechanism.  The help function and mechanism are recommended because they
are already enabled to support DBCS in the DBCS OS/2. The help information
data should be separated from the program code, so that they can be translated
and included easily later on. See the <A HREF="208_L2_SingleModule.html">Single
Module</A> for the considerations of MRI and PII, and the <A HREF="221_L3_IPFCInformationPrese.html">IPFC
Information Presentation Facility Compiler</A> for the information of creating
help information for a PM application programs.
