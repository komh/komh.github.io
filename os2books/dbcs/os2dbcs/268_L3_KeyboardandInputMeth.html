<P>
There are no difference between keyboard mode and the input method mode.
Some keyboard mode will invoke the input method function and some will not.
There are four keyboard modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Alphanumeric Mode
<P>
This is to input the Alphanumeric characters. The Alphanumeric mode is exclusive
with the Tsangjye mode and Phonetic mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tsangjye Mode
<P>
This mode invokes the Chinese Tsangjye input method, and the user can type
in the Tsangjye defines radical character (normal and well known Chinese
characters). The combination of these radical characters compose a Chinese
character. If the combination is valid to compose a Chinese character, the
result Chinese character is sent, else the error message is shown. This
input method is most popular among skilled users.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Phonetic Mode
<P>
This mode invokes the Chinese Phonetic input method, and the user can type
in the Phonetic symbol character (Most Chinese students learned them in
primary schools). The combination of these characters is mapped a candidate
list of Chinese character.  The user selects the candidate from the candidate
list and fix it by the enter key.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SBCS or DBCS Mode
<P>
These modes have effect on only Alphanumeric characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
