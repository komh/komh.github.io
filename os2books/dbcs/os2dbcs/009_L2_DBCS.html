<P>
Most written Asian languages are based on ideographic symbols, rather than
the alphabet, for example, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional
Chinese.  They have thousands of characters beyond the limit of one-byte
representation, i.e. 256 characters.  (Hangeul in Korean characters is not
an ideographic system but has more than 256 characters in it.)  If we use
two bytes, namely, 16 bits, we can present 65,536 (256x256) kinds of characters.
 So we need two bytes for each character to create coded character sets
for these languages.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Two Bytes to Represent
<P>
Processing these languages on a computer, then, requires some way to represent
thousands of characters, using two bytes to represent one character.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Different Input Methods
<P>
DBCS input methods are different from those used with alphabet-based languages.
 It makes keyboard operation and/or input handling more complex compared
to the SBCS world.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Two Positions to Print and Display
<P>
Currently, two single-byte positions are used to print and display one double-byte
character in monospaced font environment such as full screen sessions.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Higher Resolution
<P>
The complexity of the characters used in the ideographic languages also
requires higher resolution of displays. The minimum resolution for the DBCS
character font is 16 x 16. A typical resolution for business quality personal
computer displays (or printers) accommodating Kanji/Chinese characters is
24 x 24 or more dots per character.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
