<P>
Normally, PM application programs need not to be aware of the printer device,
because it is a kind of output device like display device. If application
programs use the device context function, then all the handling are done
by the PM printer drivers.
<P>
If the application program sets the DEVESC_RAWDATA, then it must know the
data stream of that printer and prepares the appropriate data stream by
itself. This document does not cover the data stream or control character
information. Refer to them in related manuals or technical references of
the printer.
<P>
There are three types of data streams that are supported in DBCS PM:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PS/55<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->ESC/P<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PostScript<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Control characters of these printers are different from each other. Again,
this is not a DBCS unique problem since many types of printers are available
for PS/2.  However, your program can be device-independent as long as you
use PM calls and avoid using printer control characters.
