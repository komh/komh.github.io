<P>
Most computer users today communicate in one of the languages derived from
Latin or Greek.  In addition to sharing many common root words, these languages
are a phonetic system, expressed in a limited number of alphabetic characters.

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Simple to Process
<P>
From the perspective of the computer processing, these languages are relatively
simple to handle, since the total number of characters (alphanumerics and
symbols) are less than the 256 binary values expressible in one byte.  For
the same reason, it makes keyboards with only one or two shift keys very
handy for data entry.  In addition, the fact that the characters are visually
relatively simple allows them to be expressed with good legibility in display
formats requiring only from 8 x 8 through 9 x 14 dots.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
