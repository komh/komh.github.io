<H1>Dialog Unit and Dialog Size Handling</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
When you use a dialog box, however, you do not need to take care of this
difference.  Dialog templates use<I> dialog units</I>. The dialog unit is
expressed in terms of the<I> default standard character size</I>. [A horizontal
dialog unit is 0.25 of the standard character size.  A vertical dialog unit
is 0.125 of the standard size. ] Therefore you do not need to reformat a
dialog box when displaying it on DBCS PM. Dialog boxes will be automatically
sized. However, as we already discussed in <A HREF="101_L5_SystemDefaultFont.html">System
Default Font</A>, the size of the biggest dialog box must not bigger than
the size of the screen, or the end user will have a window operation problem.
Suppose the width of your dialog box is 350 dialog units, it fits for VGA
on SBCS PM but is too wide for VGA and DA/2 on DBCS PM.
<P>
Another consideration is that an English phrases are usually shorter than
equivalent phrases in other languages; therefore, additional space is required
for translation. See Section<I> MRI Expansion</I> of<I> National Language
Information and Design Guide: Volume 1</I> (SE09-8001).
<P>
The dialog unit provides device-independence of relations between the sizes
of dialog elements (windows, controls and system font).  However, the proportion
of the dialog unit to the screen in pel is not device-independent.  The
following shows how to calculate the size of a dialog unit by the screen
resolution of the display device and the system default font:  (please also
refer the <A HREF="102_L6_SystemDefaultFontSiz.html">Display devices' screen
size in pel and in dialog unit</A>)

       - Height :  480 / (16 * 0.125) = 240

   (Case of VGA on SBCS PM)


       - Width  :  640 / ( 8 * 0.25 ) = 320
       - Height :  480 / (18 * 0.125) = 213

   (Case of VGA on DBCS PM version 2.x)


       - Width  : 1040 / (12 * 0.25 ) = 346.6666...
       - Height :  768 / (24 * 0.125) = 256

   (Case of DA/2 on DBCS PM version 1.x)
