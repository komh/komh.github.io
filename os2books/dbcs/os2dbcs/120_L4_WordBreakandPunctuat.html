<H1>Word Break and Punctuation</H1><!-- entering slot 126 -->
<P>
English text (or text of European languages) is usually formatted breaking
it to multiple lines at word boundaries, i.e. at blanks. This (called<I> word
break</I>) is not applicable to text of DBCS countries' languages, in which
words are not separated (except Korean Hangeul).
<P>
Instead of the word break, text of Asian languages is formatted in another
way called<I> punctuation hanging</I> (or<I> kinsoku-shori</I> in Japanese).
 Certain characters are not located at the beginning of a line and another
set of characters are not located at the end of a line. For example, punctuation
characters are not located at the beginning of a line.  Sets of characters
vary from country to country.
<P>
<B>WinDrawText</B> does the punctuation hanging if you set the<B> DT_WORDBREAK
</B>flag on.
<P>
The<B> LTEXT</B> in dialog box also handles the punctuation hanging if you
set the<B> DT_WORDBREAK</B> flag on.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the current DBCS OS/2, the punctuation characters are only
defined by DBCS characters.  For example a DBCS "." is a punctuation character,
but the SBCS "." is not a punctuation character. To avoid the problem, if
you prepare message text and require the punctuation handling, you should
prepare the text in pure DBCS text. The punctuation of mixed SBCS and DBCS
text will not be handled correctly.
