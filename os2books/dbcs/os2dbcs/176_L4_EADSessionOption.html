<P>
An EAD (two bytes) is associated with each display position on a presentation
space and follows each display position (or an EAB if it exists) when the
<B>EAD</B> option is used.  The bit definition of EAD's is shown below.

<PRE>Byte 1
Bit Character Position     Field Attribute Position
--- ------------------     ------------------------
0   DBCS character         Reserved
1   1st byte of DBCS char  Reserved
2   SO                     SO/SI exist            (3270 only)
3   SI                     Bit 3-4: Field type    (5250 only)
                             bit 34 7
4   Dead Position                00 0 Default (accepts only SBCS)
      (such as the last          00 1 Reserved
      byte of an odd             01 0 DBCS Only Field
      length DBCS field)              (accepts only bracketed
                                       DBCS*)

                                      (accepts only pure DBCS)
                                 10 0 DBCS Either Field
                                      (accepts either only SBCS or
                                      bracketed DBCS*)
                                 10 1 Reserved
                                 11 0 DBCS Open Field
                                      (accepts mixture of SBCS and
                                      DBCS*)
                                 11 1 Reserved
5   Reserved               SO/SI creation enabled (3270 only)
                           (i.e. SBCS/DBCS Mixed Field)
6   Reserved               Character attribute(s) exists
                           (i.e. SA Order used)
7   Reserved               Extended bit for alternative meaning for
                           Bit 3 and 4.

Note: *) <I>Bracketed DBCS string</I> is a DBCS string bracketed
         with SO and SI, i.e. SBCS/DBCS mixed string that has
         no SBCS characters.
      **) <I>DBCS Graphic Field</I> was supported from OS/400
         V2R3 and CM/2 1.1.  Bits 4 and 7 are on if the field
         attribute byte is for this type of field.
