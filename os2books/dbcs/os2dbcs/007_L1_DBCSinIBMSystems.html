<H1>DBCS in IBM Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
Welcome to the IBM DBCS world. In countries that use ideographic characters
like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, it is a fundamental requirement to handle
DBCS as well as SBCS in application systems. In such countries, application
systems are required to store DBCS data into the data base, to create panels
with DBCS text and fields, or to print reports with DBCS the same way that
SBCS data are supported.
<P>
This section describes characteristics of the DBCS in comparison with the
SBCS and some major considerations you may need to support DBCS.
