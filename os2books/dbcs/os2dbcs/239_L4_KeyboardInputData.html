<P>
You can enter any DBCS character from the DBCS keyboard without knowing
how to use the DBCS keyboard and the DBCS input method. One is to use DBCS
alphanumeric, and the other is to use decimal value input. The ALT key allows
you to enter any character code from 1 to 255. Hold the ALT key down and
on the numeric key-pad, type the decimal value of the characters you want
to enter. Then release the ALT key. Repeat the ALT key and the numeric value
input for the second byte of DBCS character you would like to enter. The
value is interpreted as a character code and is sent through the keyboard
routine to the system or application program.
<P>
You can refer the <A HREF="260_L1_KeyboardandInputMeth.html">Keyboard and
Input Method in Each DBCS Country</A> and try to find out the function key
to change the keyboard mode.  If you can find out the DBCS key which toggles
the keyboard between DBCS mode and SBCS mode, then you can input some alphanumeric
DBCS characters from the keyboard. You know these alphanumeric DBCS characters,
so you can judge what you have typed in from the keyboard and what you will
get on the screen.
