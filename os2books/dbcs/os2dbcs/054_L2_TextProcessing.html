<P>
In English and other European languages, words are separated by blanks from
each other.  But, in DBCS countries' languages, words are not separated
(except Korean Hangeul).  This causes several differences in text processing
such as text formatting and word search.  For text formatting, see <A HREF="120_L4_WordBreakandPunctuat.html">Word
Break and Punctuation</A>.  For word search, there is no simple solution;
to recognize words, you need dictionaries and intelligent logics.
