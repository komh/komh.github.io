<H1>Data Type</H1><!-- entering slot 49 -->
<P>
Some products (such as Database Manager and some programming languages)
support the<I> DBCS data type</I> (or the<I> graphic data type</I>) in addition
to the<I> character data type</I>.  The DBCS data type accepts only DBCS
strings while the character data type accepts SBCS/DBCS mixed strings (including
SBCS strings and DBCS strings by definition of<I> SBCS/DBCS mixed string</I>).

<P>
<B>Note: </B> In a PC environment, the DBCS data type is merely a subclass
 (special case) of the character data type since SO/SI are not used. In
a host environment, however, the above is not true.  The DBCS data type
contains DBCS characters without SO/SI while, in the character data type,
DBCS characters are always bracketed by SO/SI.
<P>
There are some differences in handling SBCS/DBCS mixed strings from that
of DBCS strings as explained in the following sections.
