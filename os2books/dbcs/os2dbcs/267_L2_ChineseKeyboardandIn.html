<H1>Chinese Keyboard and Input Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 274 -->Unlike Japanese and Korean, in Chinese language
only Chinese characters are used in Chinese documents.  The situation is
same in both Simplified Chinese (used in P.R.C.) and Traditional Chinese
(used in R.O.C.).
<P>
In Traditional Chinese dictionaries, the phonetic symbols are used to indicate
the pronunciation of the Chinese characters but are not used as the indexes
to search a Chinese character. The numbers of stroke, or radical (a part
or a component of a Chinese character) are used as the index to search a
Chinese character.
<P>
In Simplified Chinese, the Alphabet is used to indicate the pronunciation
of the Chinese character.  The Xinhua Chinese dictionary uses the Alphabet
as the index to search a Chinese character.
<P>
Based on the above situation, there are numbers of Chinese input methods
provided in the current Chinese information processing industry. In IBM
Chinese system software products, the following Chinese input methods are
supported:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tsangjye Input Method (T-Chinese)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Phonetic Input Method (T-Chinese)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Radical Input Method (S-Chinese)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Ping-in Input Method (S-Chinese)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The Chinese input methods other than these input methods,
are not covered in this document.
