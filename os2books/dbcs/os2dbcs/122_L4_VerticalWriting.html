<H1>Vertical Writing</H1><!-- entering slot 128 -->
<P>
Most languages are written in horizontal direction but vertical writing
format is needed in DBCS languages. Some word processing application programs
provide this function to the DBCS users. In DBCS PM, the GpiSetCharDirection
function can be applied for this purpose. However, application needs to
select or request the user to select the vertical writing font when the
vertical writing function is required. Currently, the only vertical font
in DBCS PM is the ATM Heisei font for OS/2 J. The vertical font provides
some symbol characters in a different position because they have different
position in the vertical writing format and this can not be done by using
only the GPI function.
<P>
The A string in horizontal and vertical writing format shows the string
in a horizontal writing format and in a vertical horizontal writing format.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Some vertical fonts in DBCS Windows provide the SBCS characters
font in a 90 degree right rotation.  However, this is not required because
the application program can rotate a string to 90 degree by GPI functions.
