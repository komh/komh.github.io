<H1>Char Extra and Breakchar Extra</H1><!-- entering slot 127 -->
<P>
The character-break-extra attribute provides a space value that increases
or decreases the spacing for break characters in a string. The character-extra
attribute provides a spacing value that increases or decreases the spacing
between characters in a string. Since Japanese and Chinese do not use the
break character in their text format, when application program wants to
fill a string of text into a field which is longer than the text, the character-break-extra
will not place the text correctly. On the other hand, the character-extra
attribute will place the DBCS text to fit the field, because it applies
to all characters. The APIs that relate to the character-extra and character-break-extra
are GpiSetCharBreakExtra and GpiSetCharExtra. The Character Extra and break
character extra in DBCS string shows the string before and after the character-break-extra
or character-extra attribute are set.

Character Extra and break character extra in DBCS string
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The break character is defined by each font. The break character
is an SBCS character. Normally, it is the SBCS space character or the character
separator. The DBCS space character is not the break character. Therefore,
if the break character extra is set to a string with DBCS space, then there
is no change unless there are some SBCS space characters in it. There are
no break character in Japanese and Chinese language, but in Korean language,
the space character is a word separator and is defined as the break character.
