<H1>Types of Character Data</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
Ideally, SBCS/DBCS mixed strings should be supported wherever character
strings can be used in your program.  The following breaks usages to give
you a general idea on their DBCS support priorities:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Numeric data
<P>
Usually SBCS characters are used for numeric data, although each DBCS code
page has DBCS numeric characters in it.  You do not need to support DBCS
for numeric data.  However, country-unique formatting of numeric data should
be considered.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Code data
<P>
Usually SBCS characters are used for coded data such as employee code and
department code, although there are DBCS alphabetic characters as well as
DBCS numeric characters.  Therefore, you need not to support DBCS for coded
data.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Text data
<P>
Examples of text data are:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Message<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Panel<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Item description<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Note, remark, comment<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Report title<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Report header<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> The following
two are related to text data categories:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->PII (Program Integrated Information)
<P>
Messages and panels are called PII.  PII should be DBCS-enabled and translated
to national languages, such as Japanese and Korean.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Fields and items for text data
<P>
Fields and elements for text data, product description, for example, should
support DBCS.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Name
data for application users
<P>
Examples of this category are:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Person name<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Address<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Part name<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> These should support
DBCS.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Name data for communication
between the system and the user or programmers (or name data for the system
to identify system resources)
<P>
Examples are:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Identifier (such as variable name, file name, user-ID)
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Command verb name<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Mnemonics<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> DBCS support for
these items is desired for easy remembrance and for better self-documentation.

<P>
DBCS input operation, however, requires more keystrokes than SBCS input.
 Because of this, the user may not utilize DBCS name support. Selecting
from a list with DBCS items are preferred instead of inputting DBCS items
repeatedly.
<P>
Therefore, if you provide some mechanism which minimizes DBCS input, DBCS
name support will be fully appreciated, as for example, the case of DBCS
variable name support in program languages.  If you also provide a syntax
sensitive editor for the languages, it might be a good idea to list up the
already defined variable names for selection at the appropriate places.
