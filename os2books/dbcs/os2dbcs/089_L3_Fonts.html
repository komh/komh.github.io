In DBCS PM, an application program can display text data, both SBCS and
DBCS text, by the text output APIs like in an SBCS PM, and most of them
are the same. In fact, most application programs that are designed for the
SBCS PM, can run on the DBCS PM and display the DBCS text in a combined
code page as well as the SBCS text. However, if application programs use
a font that does not provide DBCS font data, then the DBCS text will not
be displayed even though the current code page is a combined code page.
The key point to display the DBCS text is to use DBCS font data.
