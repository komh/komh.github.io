<H1>Differences between SBCS and DBCS System Hardware</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
Because of the different input and output requirements, there are differences
between the SBCS system hardware and DBCS system hardware. The SBCS hardware
is such as the IBM PS/2 or PS/VP. The DBCS hardware is known as the IBM
PS/55 or PS/V. The DBCS OS/2, from versions 2.0 support some SBCS system
hardware and also some personal computers hardware of local PC makers. The
DBCS OS/2 also runs on the PS/2 and PC AT compatible hardware.  Most IBM
customers in far east Asian countries run their OS/2 application programs
on the DBCS OS/2 with the DBCS system hardware that are announced and supported
officially by IBM of the far east Asian countries, the PS/55 and PS/V. Most
of the differences are hidden by the operating system.
