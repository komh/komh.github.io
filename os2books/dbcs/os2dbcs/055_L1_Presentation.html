<P>
Presentation services are one of the most important functions for DBCS and
NLS support because they manage user interface, which is important for NLS
and has some differences for NLS.
<P>
The Presentation Manager of the DBCS OS/2 (hereafter called DBCS PM) is
a natural extension of SBCS PM.  This chapter explains how DBCS PM is extended
to support DBCS, and provides guidelines and information for you to support
DBCS in PM programming.
