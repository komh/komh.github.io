<P>
The DBCS keyboard system provides the keyboard re-mapping function for the
character sets which can be typed in from the keyboard with one or two key
strokes. A user presses a predefined key to change the keyboard to an input
mode of the character set, and the system will remap the keyboard layout
so that user can input the characters that defined in this keyboard mode.

<P>
The system provides an area to show the current keyboard mode on the screen
or a window, and this area is called the Keyboard Status Line.
