<P>
It would be helpful to consider how an application works with the NLS and
DBCS related parameters. The following is just to give you hints and tips
in designing your application.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->System Environment Dependent
<P>
The application program handles the data according to the environment on
which it is executed (i.e. it assumes the data and environment). When there
is no NLS or DBCS information in the data, or when the application program
does not refer the information from the data and just handles the data by
the method according to the environment, the program is system environment
dependent and the user must set up the right environment for the data that
need to be processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Data Oriented
<P>
The application program sets up the system environment according to data
which is required for handling (e.g. data is tagged with code page id).
Some application programs put the code page information in their data so
that they know what environment is required for the data and set up the
environment for the data. DBCS OS/2 provides the application program interface
to know what environments are supported. So, if the application program
find the required code page is not supported by the current system, it can
handle the error case.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->User Selection
<P>
An application program allows the user to select the environment for the
data. If it is a single code page environment, like the early version of
DOS, then the user has no choice and select the supported data to process.
If the environment supports multiple code pages, like OS/2, then user can
switch the environment to the appropriate code page.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
