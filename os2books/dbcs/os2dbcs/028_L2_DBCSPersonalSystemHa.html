<H1>DBCS Personal System Hardware</H1><!-- entering slot 30 -->
<P>
This section describes the system hardware that are used in the DBCS countries.
Basically, a DBCS system hardware is different from a SBCS system hardware
in the keyboard, display and printer devices.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In DBCS countries, the DBCS unique hardware were required
to provide the DBCS functions. However, the current personal system hardware,
and the DBCS system software have been improved so that the SBCS hardware
have enough capability for the DBCS software, and the DBCS system software
can support the SBCS hardware as well as the DBCS hardware. Currently, the
DBCS hardware, PS/55 system unit and its peripheral devices, are not sold
in the market of PRC. The OS/2 P support only the PS/2 and PS/VP system
hardware.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
PS/55 is known as the DBCS personal system hardware. The relation ship between
PS/55 and IBM PS/2 could be described as close cousins. Both are built from
the Intel 80286/80386/80486 family of microprocessors. The difference of
them is that the PS/55 has a DBCS keyboard which has more keys than the
keyboard of a PS/2. Besides the CGA, EGA, VGA and XGA that the PS/2 supports,
the PS/55 supports also a DBCS unique display adapter card.  The PS/55 high
resolution adapter card, also called DA/2 (Display Adapter/2 card), has
a built in ROM, which provides the DBCS font data for the DBCS system software.
The font data of this ROM is called ROS font.  The PS/55 printer also provides
the built in ROS font and handles the PS/55 printer data stream.

As the personal system had been evolved from IBM-PC or PC XT to PC AT, PS/2
and PS/VP, the PS/55 also had been evolved from 5550 series to PS/55 series
and PS/V.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Old (Non-Micro Channel Architecture) Models
<P>
The bus structure and adapters of PS/55 non-Micro Channel Architecture models
are not compatible with PS/2 Micro Channel Architecture models, IBM PC or
AT.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Micro Channel Architecture Models
<P>
The recent IBM PS/55 models, which use Micro Channel Architecture and have
a VGA on the system board are called Micro Channel Architecture models (or
converged models).  The Micro Channel Architecture models with a G-keyboard
(a DBCS keyboard, compatible with IBM PS/2 Enhanced Keyboard) and a converged
printer are compatible with the Micro Channel Architecture models of IBM
PS/2, such as model 70 and 80. They support two modes of the display and
printer operations, one for DBCS environment, the other for SBCS environment
respectively. Therefore, you can install SBCS OS2 and IBM PC DOS onto the
Micro Channel Architecture models; and many IBM PS/2 applications can be
executed without modifications (but only for SBCS). In P.R.C., the PS/55
hardware are replaced by the PS/VP hardware.  The DBCS system software for
PRC do not even support the DA/2 of the PS/55, but only support the VGA,
SVGA or XGA.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PS/V System
<P>
The PS/V system is a Japanese version of PS/Value Point system. They are
different on some features that required by the local marketing. Most current
DBCS system software can support the PS/V as well as the PS/VP.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->OEM Personal System and OADG
<P>
OADG, Open Architecture Developers' Group (established by IBM Japan) defined
a minimum system hardware specification for the DBCS system in Japan. The
OADG hardware requires a PC AT compatible system board with a VGA or higher
resolution display adapter and a DBCS keyboard. In other DBCS countries
other than Japan, a similar hardware is required for the DBCS system software,
the DBCS OS/2 and DOS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
