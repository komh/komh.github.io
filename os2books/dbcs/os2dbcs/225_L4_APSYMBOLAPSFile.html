<H1>APSYMBOL.APS File</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->The APSYMBOL.APS file, in the national language
version of an OS/2 programming toolkit package, is the default APSYMBOL.APS
for that language, but you need to make sure you are using the valid file
for the code page of IPF that you want to build. You can do this by browsing
the APSYMBOL.APS file in the environment of that code page.  If the character
and symbols in the file are displayed correctly, then you know you are using
the right file.  Else, you must find out the file with a name like APSYMxxx.APS
where xxx is 932, 934..., the combined code page ID that you are looking
for.  If you find it, rename it to APSYMBOL.APS. Because the combined code
page 93x and 94x share the same DBCS code page, so they share the same APSYMBOL.APS
file.  For example, the code page 932 and 942 share the same file APSYM932.APS,
and 938 and 948 share the same file APSYM938.APS.
