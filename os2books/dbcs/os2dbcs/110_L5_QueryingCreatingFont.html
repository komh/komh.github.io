<P>
SBCS PM simply considers a code page as a set of pointers into the<I> Universal
Glyph List</I>  (UGL) since many of the characters required by each SBCS
code pages are common.  However, this approach is difficult to be implemented
for DBCS.  There are so many DBCS characters to define in an universal list
and the Double-Byte Character Set system is virtually open-ended (allows
user-defined characters).
<P>
If applications need to choose a combined code page font (because of the
user's request and so on), you need to search the array of font metrics,
which you got using<B> GpiQueryFonts</B>, for the specific code page in
addition to other things that the user may have selected (such as a face
name).  The code page should be specified in<B> codepage</B> of<B> FATTRS
</B>to<B> GpiCreateLogFont</B>.
<P>
When creating a logical font, do not hard-code code page ID's or face-names
but get them by querying the system (by<B> DosGetCp</B> for the current
code page or<B> GpiQueryFonts</B> for available face-names) or you may allow
the user to specify or select them.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For a combined code page, size information, such as<B> xAveCharWidth</B>,
in the font metrics is for SBCS characters.
