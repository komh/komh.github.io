<H1>Keyboard and Input Methods in DBCS PM</H1><!-- entering slot 66 -->
<P>
OS/2 provides the DBCS keyboard function and input methods in two environments,
the VIO full screen mode (includes the OS/2 and DOS box) and PM. The implementation
of keyboard and input method functions in  OS/2 full screen mode, including
DOS full screen mode, is different from PM. In the full screen mode, basically
an application program needs not to be aware of the keyboard and input method
functions.  From an application program point of view, the keyboard data
of DBCS OS/2 and SBCS OS/2 are the same.  Nothings need to be changed.  The
keyboard status line is located at the 26th line, so an application program
can use from the 1st line to 25th line like in the SBCS OS/2. In this document,
we will go into details of the keyboard and input method functions in DBCS
PM and not in the full screen mode.
