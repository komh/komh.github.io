There are two types of comparison function:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Determine if two strings are either equal or
unequal with each other.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Determine which of the two strings is higher-ordered
or lower-ordered than the other.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> In this section,
only (1) is described.  In the case of (2), refer to <A HREF="052_L2_Ordering.html">Ordering</A>.

<P>
Alphanumeric and special character are contained in DBCS code pages as well
as in SBCS code pages.  Currently most products treat DBCS alphanumeric
and special characters differently from those of SBCS.  The treatment depends
on the characteristics of your product.
<P>
For example, in a text retrieval function, an option to treat DBCS alphanumeric
characters the same as SBCS is desired like SBCS users want an option to
ignore upper or lowercase of alphabetic characters.
<P>
If you are going to support this option, see <A HREF="024_L4_DBCSAlphanumericChar.html">DBCS

<UL>Search

<P>
When handling SBCS/DBCS mixed strings, care must be taken to find a matching
string in a target. It is important to recognize characters, not just byte
comparisons, because some byte values may occur as either an SBCS character
or as the second byte of a DBCS character. This can be handled by doing
character (one or two byte) comparisons aligned on character boundaries.

<P>
See also Comparison for handling of DBCS alphanumeric and special characters.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Wild Card Character (or Global Search Character)

<P>
Suppose your program supports two global search characters, '*' and '?':
 to represent any number of SBCS characters, '?' to represent any single
SBCS character.  If an entry field accepts both DBCS and SBCS characters,
use the '*' to represent a string of any SBCS or DBCS characters.  Use the
'?' to represent any single DBCS or SBCS character in that position.  However,
if users can only type DBCS characters into an entry field, the DBCS '*'
represents any string of any DBCS character.  The DBCS '?' represents any
single DBCS character in that position.
<PRE>Example

       /D1*D2/           D1DjD2        matched
                         D1ssD2        matched
                         D1sD2         matched
                         D1D2          matched


       /D1?D2/           D1DjD2        matched
                         D1ssD2        unmatched
                         D1sD2         matched
                         D1D2          unmatched

where
'*' and '?' denotes SBCS wild card character.

<UL>Parsing

<P>
A Parser scans a given string, performs syntax checks and decomposes the
strings following a well-defined format or set of rules.  The fundamental
requirement is to ensure that character comparisons are done rather than
byte comparisons.  This requires that all checks for syntactically significant
characters observe character boundaries and character sizes in all cases.

<P>
For example, when a parser searches for a single byte delimiter, it must
be careful to ignore bytes which occur<!-- entering slot 55 --> within two
byte characters.
<PRE>CHANGE |DjDiDj|DjDjDj|

where  | = 7CH
      Di = 817CH
</PRE>

<P>
The second byte of Di must not be considered as a delimiter.  It is part
of a character and must retain its identity as such.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Substitution

<P>
A program sometimes needs to change portions of a text string at execution
time.  A changeable portion is defined in a string by a<I> substitutable
variable</I> and replaced with a real value at execution time.  A substitution
operation can be considered as a combination of search, deletion and insertion
operations.  See Search and <A HREF="049_L2_InsertionandAppendin.html">Insertion</A>.

<P>
Messages are a good example of variable substitution.  Messages often contain
information regarding what data is wrong during execution.  Variable substitution
can also occur in the literal portion or the text portion of panels.
<PRE>Example of Variable Substitution in a Message

- Message Format = STRING &amp;VAR FOUND
  ('&amp;' is prefixed to substitution variables.)

- IF &amp;VAR = ABC THEN "STRING ABC FOUND"         SBCS substitution

- IF &amp;VAR = D1D2 THEN "STRING D1D2 FOUND"       DBCS substitution

<UL>Change
<P>
CHANGE operation for SBCS/DBCS mixed strings requires no special consideration
beyond that of searching for the original string and substituting the new
string.  Both these operations have already been covered.
