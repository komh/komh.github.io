<H1>Different NLVs of Toolkit</H1><!-- entering slot 224 -->
<P>
There are different NLVs for different DBCS countries. The major differences
of these NLVs are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>APSYMBOL.APS</B> (Symbol table for IPF)
<P>
The symbol tables for all the DBCS countries and their names are APS???.APS.
('???' above is the code page ID, for example, '437' for code page 437.)
IPFC will apply the APSYMBOL.APS file only, so you need to rename<B> APS437.APS
</B>to<B> APSYMBOL.APS</B> when you want to compile a 437 code page source
file.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Most toolkit NLV packages include all the APS???.APS files
for different code pages.  However, the previous packages may not include
all the APS???.APS files that the latest package has.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MRI
<P>
MRI of the sample programs, on-line technical information and other tools
in Japanese package are translated, but are kept as is in the packages of
other DBCS countries.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
