<H1>IBM Standard and National Standard</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
Besides the coded character set standards that defined by IBM, there are
many other national or de facto coded character set standards that defined
by the national governments or the local non-governmental organizations.
 Some of them had become the industry de facto standards, and IBM defined
new code pages for them.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Japanese Industry Standard Code, called JIS code, is a Japanese national
standard and an ISO-7 bit based code. An SBCS character set and a DBCS character
set were defined in the ISO-7 bit code structure in 1978, so-called JIS
'78.  The SBCS character set of code page 897 and 1041, SBCS part of combined
code page 932 and 942, includes the SBCS character set of the JIS code.
The DBCS character set of code page 301, DBCS part of combined code page
932 and 942, includes the JIS '78 DBCS character set with the same order
as JIS. In 1983, 73 DBCS characters added to JIS code and 26 pair of DBCS
characters were swapped their order from the JIS '78. The revised JIS code
has been called JIS '83. In 1990, two more DBCS characters added. The DBCS-PC
code page 301 has been enhanced to support all the characters defined in
the latest JIS, but the characters are sequenced based on JIS '78. OS/2
J2.1 users can select the JIS '78 order or the JIS '83 order. Since the
system software handles the difference between JIS'78 and JIS'83, application
software need not to be aware of this difference.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Korea Standard PC code, called KS code, is defined by the Korea government
for the information industry.  Its SBCS and DBCS character sets are different
from the PC code which IBM once defined. In 1992, IBM defined a new code
page 1088 from SBCS code page; a new code page 951 for a DBCS-PC code page;
and a new code page 949 for the combined code page of SBCS 1088 and DBCS
951. The <A HREF="245_L2_KoreanStandardKSCode.html">SBCS Code Page 1088
#Korea Standard Code (KS-Code) ─ Personal Computer┘</A> shows the code page
1088.  the SBCS character codes that are defined in the code page 1088.

<P>
PRC national standard code, called GB code is defined by the PRC government
for the information industry in the country.  Its DBCS character set is
different from the S-Chinese character set which IBM once defined. In 1993,
IBM defined a new code page 1115 for a SBCS code page; a new code page 1380
for a DBCS-PC; and a new code page 1381 for the combined code page of SBCS
01115 and DBCS 1380.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->T-Chinese PC (Big 5 code)
<P>
Major de facto industry standard code, called Big 5 code, is defined by
several software companies of R.O.C..  Its DBCS character set is different
from the T-Chinese character set in code page 927 which IBM once defined.
In 1993, IBM defined a new DBCS code page 947 as its DBCS code page, and
the code page 950 as the combined code page of SBCS 01114 and DBCS 947.
This code page is supported in the DOS T/V, the DOS system software for
T-Chinese, besides the current code page 938.  It will be supported in the
later version of OS/2 T.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
