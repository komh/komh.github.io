Introduction
<P>
This book is written by DBCS Technical Coordination Office, Yamato Lab,
IBM Japan. DTCO is located in the suburbs of Tokyo and provides DBCS technical
guidance and assistance to IBM worldwide development groups.  This book
was primarily written for IBM development groups but will be very helpful
to anyone outside IBM that want to make their programs enabled for DBCS.

</UL>The purpose of this book is to provide developers
of international products with the information and guidance necessary to
plan, design, code and test functions supporting DBCS on their products
that run on OS/2.
<P>
Laws, business customs and so on vary from country to country.  Also, what
kind of country-specific knowledge is required depends on the type of application
products. Such application-specific NLS information and guidance are beyond
the scope of this book.
<P>
This manual provides information and guidelines that are important and sufficient
for the vast majority of international products:  Not to provide all DBCS
OS/2 details.
<P>
This manual is written for DBCS OS/2 Version 2.1 applications.  Many enhanced
functions in version 2.1 are only available in this version, but the DBCS
consideration in this book can be applied to all versions of DBCS OS/2.
