ulIMVersion(input) : Version of IM Interface. High word of this member contains
                     the major version, and Low word contains the minor version.
                     It is 1.0 in this release.

                       It is 1.0 in this release.

ulIMECaps(output)IME Capability flags which have the combination of the following flags.

    <B>IME_CAPS_ACCEPTCONVERSIONSTRING</B> : This means that the application can set
                                      the conversion string data to IME.

    <B>IME_CAPS_INHERITCONVERSIONMODE</B> : IME is capable to inherit the conversion mode.

    <B>IME_CAPS_INHERITINPUTMODE</B> : IME is capable to inherit the input mode.

    <B>IME_CAPS_PRIVATEUI</B> : This flag means that IME has the special dialog panel other
                         than the normal panels.

    <B>IME_CAPS_PROVIDEREADINGSTRING</B> : IME is capable to provide the reading string
                                    from the conversion string which is set
                                    by the application.

    <B>IME_CAPS_PROVIDEUI</B> : This flag means that IME provides the PM user interface
                         while the instance in PM environment.

    <B>IME_CAPS_SCREENSWITCHABLE</B> : This flag means that IME allows that the IMInstance
                                can be switchable between the different screen group.
                                For example, Dos box can be fullscreen or window, by
                                a hot-key pressing. If IME sets this flag, the same
                                IMInstance i ed for both environment.
                                If IME does not set this flag, another IMInstance is
                                created at the screen switch.

    <B>IME_CAPS_UNICODE</B> : The string which is used in any IME I/F is Unicode string.
                       (Not supported in this release).

ulConversionCaps(output) : Conversion mode capability flags which shares the bit definition with
                  <A HREF="040_L3_ImQueryIMMode.html"><B>IMI_CM_*</B></A> flags in IMMode.

ulInputCaps(output) : Input mode capability flags which hares the bit difinition with
                  <A HREF="040_L3_ImQueryIMMode.html"><B>IMI_IM_*</B></A> flags in IMMode.

chClassName(output) : This is a 256 byte string buffer. If IME is capable to handle
                      PM user interface(i.e. set <B>IME_CAPS_PROVIDEUI</B>), IME must fill
                      the class name of the IME Window class. System will register
                      the IME Window procedure with this class name. This field is
                      ignored if <B>IME_CAPS_PROVIDEUI</B> is not set.

chWndProcName(output) : This is a 256 byte string buffer. If IME is capable to handle
                        PM user interface(i.e. set <B>IME_CAPS_PROVIDEUI</B>), IME must fill
                        the IME Window procedure function name. This name is used to
                        get the procedure address of the window proc.
                        This window proc must be explicitly exported in the .DEF file
