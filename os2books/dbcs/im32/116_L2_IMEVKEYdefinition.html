<P>
IMEVKEY is a keyboard independent unique 16-bit key value which is assigned
to each keytops(nomenclature). The following chart shows the IMEVKEY list
for the available keyboards. Basically when the user presses the key, IMEVKEY
in Base state is generated.  If IMEVKEY at other state is noted, that IMEVKEY
is generated not only  at that state but also at the state which includes
that state, e.g.,  if IMEVKEY_foo is listed at base state and IMEVKEY_bar
is listed at  shift state, IMEVKEY_bar is also generated at Shift+Ctrl state,
but IMEVKEY_foo is generated at Alt state.
