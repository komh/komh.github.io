<P>
The following shows how IM works with OS/2 Fullscreen Input stuffs quite
simply:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="006_L1_FullscreenSupport_13.gif" WIDTH=603 HEIGHT=327>
<P>
To adapt to the new IM32 model, OS/2 Fullscreen Input stuffs need to be
modified to work with its new I/F. The above chart only shows two Fullscreen
Input stuffs, i.e. IMMON and XIMACALL, but the following modules are also
needed to modify.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
IMREGIST.EXE<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> - request SesMgr to notify a session
change<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>IMDAEMON.DLL<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> - open an Input Method Service
for each session<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>XDSCALL.DLL<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> - handle IME display requests<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>XIMACALL.DLL<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> - communicate with the IM to handle
keyboard inputs<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>IMMON.EXE<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> - notify XIMACALL of each keyboard
events<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In OS/2 Fullscreen, the current IM16 will be able to co-exist with the new
IM32. So, the original (current IM16 support) codes must not be disabled.
And they should be utilized to support the new IM32 as much as they can.
Their modification should be minimized.
<P>
The following sections explain how the IM32 works in OS/2 Fullscreen environment
at several situations. Initialization
<P>
In order to get session related events, during system IPL, IMREGIST.EXE
registers IMDAEMON.DLL to SessionManager. Currently IMDAEMON gets Session
Creation and Termination notifications. In addition to this, under IM32,
IMDAEMON needs to know the Session Change notification.
<P>
To get the new notification, IMREGIST.EXE will added a new notification
type for the session change in the request block using DosSMRegisterDD API.

<BR>
Session Creation
<P>
IMDAEMON.DLL is registered for getting the session related events. At session
creation, it is called by SessionManager, initializes its internal data
for a new session and loads the IMMON for the session. During this process,
IMDAEMON calls ImOpenService API (IM private) to open a new Input Method
Service for the session.  As the return of this API, it gets a new handle,
hIMS and stores it until session termination for subsequent IM32 requests.
The hIMS is then passed to the newly loaded IMMON through IMMonInit API.

<P>
For this, the request block of IMMonInit is needed to modify as follows:

<PRE>struct MonInitBlock {
        USHORT          len_minit;
        struct KKMonCmd *pKKMonCmd;
        HIMS                    hIMS;                   // IM32 IMS Handle
}
</PRE>

<P>
The IMMON loaded by IMMonInstall from IMDAEMON initializes its private data
area and open a new service from XIMACALL with XimaOpen API.  For subsequent
IM32 requests, XIMACALL should know the IMS handle for this IMMON (or session).
So, the request block of XimaOpen is also needed to modify like below:
<PRE>typedef struct {
        USHORT          Length;         // Block Length
        USHORT          XimaHandle;             // Xima Handle
        UCHAR           SGNum;          // Screen Group Number
        UCHAR           XimaEnv;                // Environment type of caller
        HSEM            GiveSem;                // syncro between XIMA/IMMON
        HSEM            TakeSem;                //
        HIMS                    hIMS;                   // IM32 IMS Handle
} XIMA_OPEN_BLK,

//::::: Environment type of caller (XimaEnv)  :::::
#define OS2_FULL_SCREEN         0
#define DOS_FULL_SCREEN         1
#define DOS_WINDOWED            2
#define IM32_MODE                       128             // addition to original values
</PRE>

<P>
XIMACALL calls ImSendEvent with the event, IM_OPENSESSION, in XimaOpen API.
Now, IM32 (i.e.OS2IM.DLL) knows a new Fullscreen session is opened and prepares
a new default IM Instance for the session (or hIMS). Then, XIMACALL subsequently
calls ImQuerySessionDefInstance API to get the newly created IM Instance,
i.e. hIMI,<!-- entering slot 8 --> within XimaOpen. With this hIMI, XIMACALL
registers its API entry point to the IM32 using DsmRegisterFunc API.  The
registered API entry then  will be called by the IM32 whenever IM/IME related
events occurs, e.g. request to display conversion strings.
<BR>
Session Switch
<P>
At session switch, IMDAEMON is called by Session Manager and just notifies
the IM32 of the event happened.  This notification is passed by ImSendEvent
with the event, IM_CHANGESESSION.
<BR>
Session Termination
<P>
IMDAEMON gets a notification from Session Manager when the opened session
is about to terminate.  With this notification, IMDAEMON calls IMMonDeinstall
API internally and deinstalls the loaded IMMON from the session.
<P>
As the result of this call, the IMMON receives the command, CMD_IMMONDEINSTALL
and terminates by itself.  Then, its Signal Handler gets control and within
the handler, it calls XimaClose API.
<P>
XIMACALL releases all allocated resources for this IMMON (or session) with
XimaClose.  It also deregisters the IM32 worker routine by DsmDeregisterFunc
with the stored hIMI.  (The hIMI can be also retrieved through ImQuerySessionDefInstance.)
 Then, to no tify the IM32 of the session termination, it calls ImSendEvent
with the event, IM_CLOSESESSION.
<P>
After IMMonDeinstall API returns, IMDAEMON calls ImCloseService to release
the IMS handle assigned for the session. 
<BR>
Keyboard Input
<P>
IMMON is a usual Keyboard monitor process.  It registers itself into the
keyboard monitor chain, reads keyboard packets from the chain, processes
the packets and finally writes them back to the chain.  So, applications
can get the processed keyboard packe ts naturally.
<P>
In the current IM16 model, when IMMON receives the Keyboard packet, it is
passed to XIMACALL through both XimaPreConv and XimaConv APIs.  XimaPreConv
translates the keyboard scan code to ASCII character code including DBCS
characters and Roman conversion service.  Then, XimaConv converts the translated
characters to linguistical strings using IME.
<P>
Under the new IM32 model, when IMMON calls XimaPreConv, XIMACALLS converts
the input packet to the IMCHARINFO (of OS2IM) format and calls ImSendEvent
with the event, IM_CHAR. The further requests, e.g. display candidate list,
are passed to the IM32 worker routine in XIMACALL registered at session
creation.
<BR>
CodePage Change
<P>
When a codepage (keyboard codepage) is changed, the Physical Keyboard Device
Driver (PKBD) sends a specific keyboard monitor packet out to the keyboard
monitor chain.  IMMON can know the new codepage from this packet and sets
it to XIMACALL by XimaSetCp A PI.
<P>
XIMACALL then calls ImSendEvent with the event, IM_CHANGECP to notify the
IM32 of the new code page.
<BR>
Keyboard Mode Change
<P>
In case of OS/2 Fullscreen session, keyboard modes are handled and managed
by PKBD. For example, IMMON receives NLS Mode key packet, e.g. Hiragana
in Japan, with NLS mode has been set. This means IMMON doesn't need to manipulate
the keyboard modes at all.
<P>
However, in order to notify the IM32 of the current or updated keyboard
modes, IMMON, actually XIMACALL has to look at each keyboard packet, and
once it changes the mode, it calls ImSetIMMode API with the updated mode.
 This notification has to be made fo r not only physical mode change, but
also software mode change request.
<BR>
IM16 support
<P>
The new OS/2 Fullscreen Input stuffs support both the current IM16 and the
new IM32 models.  In case of IME16<!-- entering slot 9 --> selected, they
just work as the current implementation, that is, they might not call the
IM32 for the most of their processings.  When IME32 is l oaded, they cooperate
with the IM32 (i.e.OS2IM) as much as they could. 
<BR>
Free PS Support (Setting Dialog)
<P>
The IME32s can not display their dialogues in OS/2 Fullscreen environment,
as IM system does not support the Free PS (like) Interface. If the IME32
needs to display their dialogues, the IME32 should support Legacy IME16
interface and register with IM_REGF LAG_IME16CALLABLE bit.
