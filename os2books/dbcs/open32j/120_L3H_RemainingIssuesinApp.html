Remaining Issues in Application Programming
<BR>
Using Platforms Unique Typefaces
<P>
A platform may bundle some unique typefaces, which are not available in
the others. Because bundled and installed as a platform standard, these
facenames are more often referred in the documents created in that platform.
The document that contains  platform unique typeface names may not be compatible
with other platforms. To solve this issue:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Activate the font mapper in the target platform.
If the LOGFONT information is stored in the document as expected, the font
mapper in the target system will select the closest match from the fonts
installed in the target system.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use base OS/2 Font Alias function, which allows
users to assign alias names to the OS/2 typefaces installed in the system,
to emulate platform unique facenames.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Though base OS/2 supports assigning alias names, it is recommended to translate
Win32 platform specific facenames, which are hard-coded in the applications,
to the facenames that are available in the OS/2 environment. Obtaining Resident
Font Facename
<P>
Sometimes application may require some font facenames which can be considered
as system standard so that they are rarely removed from the system. To obtain
the resident font facenames, &lt;Use this method - to be designed  DCR 28&gt;.

Porting Graphical User Interface Elements
<P>
The layout design of Graphical User Interface elements, such as dialog templates
in the resource file, is affected by the size and the metrics of system
GUI fonts. The one decides the base dialog units, and the others decide
the actual layout on the panel. Because typical application has many visual
elements, the differences of system GUI fonts between the platforms will
extremely increase the panel porting work load, which is not essential for
application's functionality. The base OS/2 will provides the Windows compatible
system GUI fonts, so that the visual element porting work load is considerably
reduced.
