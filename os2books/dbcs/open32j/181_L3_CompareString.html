 UniStrcoll is similar to CompareString without any flags.  UniStrcmpi is
similar to CompareString with NORM_IGNORECASE.  But the result of both ULS
functions are different from the result of each in WIN95. It is because
the weight of characters is different between WIN95 and ULS.  To get the
same result, Open32 uses the sort key, which is generated in Open32 to be
almost same as the sort key in WIN95.  At first, this function calls LCMapString
to get the sort key array for each string, and compares them.  All com parison-style
option flag can be passed to LCMapString function as they are. See the description
of 'LCMapString' about the sort key.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
