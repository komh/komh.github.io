Overview
<P>
This chapter describes the enhancement of the National Language Support
feature -<I> Codepage</I>,<I> Locale</I> and<I> Unicode.</I>  This enhancement
is for supporting SBCS, DBCS, and multi-lingual WIN32 application programs
on Open32. It applies to all languages releases of OS/2, except for Arabic
and Hebrew.  These bi-directional languages' support is an item for future
enhancement.
<P>
Traditional DOS, Windows, OS/2 have provided National Language Support feature
within the framework of the<I> codepage</I> architecture.  The codepage
architecture allows the user or an application program to select a character
set from one or more available character sets.  However, this framework
only determines the mapping from the code point to the graphic symbol.  It
does not determine language or culture related characteristics.
<P>
So, DOS, Windows, OS/2 application programmers have faced the problem that
they cannot develop such a common, world-wide program that can process two
or more languages or cultures. Meanwhile, in the world of Unix, the<I> locale
</I>architecture has been utilized to provide National Language Support
feature and succeeded to enable language/culture sensitive (aware) application
programs.
<P>
The locale architecture enables application programs to retrieve language/culture
dependent information and also to process data according to the selected
locale.  Microsoft adopted the locale architecture as a key feature for
National Language Support in Windows NT and then in Windows 95.
<P>
Unicode was developed by Unicode consortium and ISO.  It is a 16 bit implementation
of UCS (Universal Coded Character Set).  It makes it possible to handle
all characters of multiple languages with a single, uniformed character
set.  And, since it is encoded in fixed length (16 bit), it makes easy to
handle Asian, large character set, which are encoded in variable length
(8 bit and 16 bit, mixed) in the traditional, multi-byte codepage architecture.
 Moreover, if Unicode be used as an interchange character set, it would
be possible to unify the character set of data that are sent on the network.
 Microsoft adopted this Unicode character set in Windows NT and then in
Windows 95, on latter of which, Unicode supported is limited to several
APIs.
<P>
And now, it is time for OS/2 to support the locale and the Unicode.  OS/2
now supports these key features in the ULS (Universal Language Support)
architecture.  Using the ULS APIs, OS/2 application programmers can write
language/culture sensitive (aware) programs at C  language level.  Open32
NLS Extension extensively utilizes this ULS feature to support Windows 95's
locale and Unicode feature for Open32 application programs.
