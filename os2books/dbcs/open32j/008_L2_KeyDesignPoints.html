<I>Input Method Manager API functions</I>
<P>
OS/2 Input Method (IM) interface, called IMI, provides the same level of
functionality as that of Windows95.  In this sense, the role of Open32 NLS
Extension is to translate Windows95's IMM API calls to OS/2's IMI API calls.
 However, there's several platform specific differences.  In particular,
the difference of timing of IM related messages and kinds of those messages
leads Open32 NLS Extension to become such a state machine that keeps track
of Windows95's Input Method behavior.
<BR>
<I>Restrictions Using 16Bit IME</I>
<P>
OS/2 supports two kinds of IME (Input Method Editor); the traditional 16bit
IME and the new 32bit IME.  The latter, 32bit IME provides the same or more
functionality compared with Windows95.  However, the 16bit IME does not.

<P>
There would be several restrictions when the 16bit IME is chosen by the
user or by an application program.  As of this writing, the Input Method
for INTEL, Programming Functional Specifications does not clearly state
such restrictions.  So, we cannot describe restrictions for Open32 application
programs when 16bit IME is used.
<BR>
<I>IMM Context Mapping</I>
<P>
WIN32 IMM Context (IMC) is mapped to OS/2 IM Instance (IMI).  On WIN32 platform,
each thread is associated with an IMC.  On the other hand, on OS/2, IMI
can be associated with either a frame or a queue in a thread.  Therefore,
at thread creation time, Open32 NLS Extension calls the<I> ImSetMsgQueueProperty
</I>to switch the mode from frame-basis to thread-basis in order to emulate
the WIN32 behavior.  (Open32 creates a message queue for each Open32 application
thread.)
<BR>
<I>Keyboard Layout related API functions</I>
<P>
Most of all Keyboard Layout related API functions are supported by Open32
NLS Extension. Open32 NLS Extension internally maps HKL (Keyboard Layout
Handle) value to an associated OS/2 IME.  The messages WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST
and WM_IMPUTLANGCHANGE are supported. A HKL on Open32 NLS environment depends
on code page because IM32 API depends on PM queue code page which can be
changed by WinSetCp PM function, so the base language which is obtained
from default codepage is only supported.
<BR>
<I>HKL</I>
<P>
The HKL of Win95 is translated to OS/2 IME IME ID  using Open32 NLS Extension
internal table which is created from the result of ImQueryIMEList of OS/2.
The LangID part in HKL is created from a code pgae, and the KeyboardID part
in HKL is created sequentialy. If a IM32-IME does not exist in OS/2 environmet,
the KeyboardID is set to zero.
<P>
A Open32 application can not assume the value of HKL. If the application
will use the HKL, the value of the HKL will have to be gotten by using GetKeyboardLayout/GetKeyboardLayoutList.

<P>
Due to the current OS/2 restriction, available languages in HKL returned
from GetKeyboardLayoutList API is limited only to one language, which is
specified in the keyboard 'DEVINFO=' statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>

<P>
The HKL-IME ID table must be updated in all functions which use HKL of WIn95,
because an OS/2 IME may be installed without re-booting.
