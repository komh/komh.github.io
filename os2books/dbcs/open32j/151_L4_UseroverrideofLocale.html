User-override of Locale Information
<P>
WIN95 provides a function (<I>SetLocaleInfo</I>) for application programs
to override some of or all of the limited, user-overridable LCTYPEs.  On
Open32, such overridden information is kept on demand when the SetLocaleInfo
is called for a certain locale.  When called, Open32 checks to see if the
specified locale is a new request or not, and if new, Open32 allocates memory
for keeping its overridden information.  This memory is not freed until
that process exits.
