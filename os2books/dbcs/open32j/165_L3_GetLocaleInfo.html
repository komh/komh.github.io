<B>Functional Difference from WIN95</B>
<P>
There is no difference functionally.  But some Locale data are different
from data in WIN95. As for LOCALE_SLANGUAGE and LOCALE_SCOUNTRY, WIN95 shows
the locale information in system default language, but Open32 does always
in English.  And as Open32 gets the locale information from ULS locale information
and country information if available, all locale information in Open32 are
not always same as ones in WIN95.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<P>
This API returns the information about a locale.  Open32 supports all types
of locale information(LCTYPE) which you can get in WIN95.  These LCTYPEs
are defined in Open32's common header<I> OS2WIN.H</I>.   At first, Open32
converts LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT and LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT to the actual Locale
ID. See <A HREF="161_L3_ConvertDefaultLocale.html">ConvertDefaultLocale
</A>about this conversion. If any locale id is specified, this function
checks whether that specified locale is valid or not.
<P>
There are three types of the default locale information in the point of
view where they originate. See the <A HREF="148_L4_SupportedInstalledLo.html">comparison
table of LCTYPE</A>  as for each locale information in detail.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
