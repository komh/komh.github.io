Overview
<P>
In the Win32 platforms, selecting a keyboard layout decides an Input Language.
Similarly, selecting a font of specific character set decides an Output
Language.
<P>
Different from OS/2 fonts, every Windows font has specific character set
id in the font metrics. Because the id identifies an output language, selecting
a font changes not only the visual representation of text, but it also affects
directly to the ways of system internal text processing, such as the parsing
method to extract code points from text and the mapping to translate the
code points to glyphs in that font. Along with this, the font also indicates
in which writing system it is expected to b e used. Finding a right font
in each situation is one of the most essential operations for Win32 NLS
applications.
<P>
This chapter describes the Open32 functionality enhancements to help NLS
applications on finding a right font and operating with it.
