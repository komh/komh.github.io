National Language Support Policy on Open32
<P>
Open32 utilizes ULS information to large extent because OS/2's country information
is too short for WIN95's locale support.  For some information in WIN95
locale information which fits OS/2 country information, Open32 retrieves
it by calling DOS API, but for much other information, Open32 retrieves
it by calling ULS API.  For Unicode support, Open32 also utilizes ULS functions.
 Therefore, ULS is a prerequisite feature for the National Language Support
of Open32.
<P>
As described above, the language/locale information is a property of a thread
but can be treated as a property of a process, because there's no API to
change thread's locale on Windows 95.  So, Open32 manages locale information
per process.
<P>
Of course, ULS locale information is not 100% enough for WIN95's locale
emulation.  Such information is kept as a table in Open32.  But utilizing
ULS information as much as possible, we can minimize the size of the locale
information table prepared inside Open32.
