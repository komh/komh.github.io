Overview
<P>
This section describes IMM (Input Method Manager) API functions and Keyboard
Layout API functions supported in Open32 NLS Extension.  The IMM API functions,
which is defined in WIN32 specification, are classified into two types;
API for IMM-aware application programs and API for IME (Input Method Editor)
programs.  Open32 NLS Extension does not support the latter IMM API functions
because it is assumed that an IME vendor develops an OS/2 native IME.  Instead,
IBM provides guidelines to assist IME vendors if they port WIN95 IME programs
to the OS/2 platform.  Open32 NLS Extension supports Keyboard Layout API
functions to enable the capability to switch IMEs among installed ones.
