Abstract
<P>
Open32 NLS Extension provides National Language Support (NLS) functionality
to Open32 application developers who want to release their applications
for International Markets, or those who want to add Multilingual Content
capability to their applications.
<P>
The extended functions are designed to be compatible with Windows 95 NLS
functions so that the developers can share the most of their program source
code between Open32 and the most recent Win32 platforms. The Open32 NLS
Extension covers the following major function categories:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Input Language and Input Method Editor Management
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Character Set and Writing System Support<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Other National Language Support based on Codepage,
Locale and Unicode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This document describes the designs and the limitations of Open32 NLS functions
in the following chapters.
