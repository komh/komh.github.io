Output of Unicode Character
<P>
Open32 supports Unicode string by TextOutW, ExtTextOutW, and some other
GDI functions (see Appendix A for what APIs are available for Unicode).
 They are implemented by using conventional OS/2 APIs after converting Unicode
string to codepage string.
<P>
When a DBCS codepage is chosen for output, Unicode character below 0x0080
is converted to the codepage character by just removing 0x00 from its top.
 This means Unicode backslash character U005C is outputed as Yen or Won
when Japanese or Korean codepage is chosen respectively.
