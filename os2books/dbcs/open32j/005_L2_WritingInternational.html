Writing International Applications using Open32
<P>
Thanks to the Open32 National Language Support, application developers can
have equivalent NLS functionality for International Markets in their applications
between Open32 and the most recent Win32 platforms, simply by developing
program code in Win32 National Language Support manner.
<P>
Here some compatibility issues to be considered when developing Open32 NLS
applications are described.

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Facename Translation. Though base PM supports assigning
typeface alias names, it is recommended to translate Win32 platform specific
facenames built in the applications to the facenames available in OS/2 environment.

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To obtain the resident font facenames, &lt;Use this
method - to be designed&gt;<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Input Method Manager (IMM) Functionality. The Open32
IMM functions are designed to be compatible with Windows 95 implementation
when 32-bit OS/2 Input Method Editor is installed and selected. There are
some limitations when only 16-bit legacy OS/2 Input Method Editor is available
in the system. The detailed discussions  are described in the following
chapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Keyboard Input Event Sequence. Open32 NLS Extension
simulates Win32 Keyboard Input related events, including Win32 Virtual Key
events. However, there seems to be some event sequence incompatibilities,
by nature of differences in the base operating system designs. It is recommended
not to assume highly specific Keyboard Input event sequences.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bi-Directional Writing System Support. Current Open32
NLS Extension does not support Bi-Di specific National Language Support
functions. This limitation may be removed in a future release.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<I>Compatibility Considerations with Win32 Native Applications</I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Open32 applications, which intend to share documents
with their Win32 variants, are recommended, if necessary, to store Open32
supplied Win32 compatible NLS values in their documents.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Due to the facename differences between the platforms,
the Open32 applications that  store the font facenames in their documents
are recommended to store them with desired character set information to
activate font mapper in the target environment. It is better to have common
set of typefaces between Open32 and Win32 variants, if possible.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
