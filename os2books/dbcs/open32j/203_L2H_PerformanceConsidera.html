Open32 Program Start-up Time
<P>
Currently, availability check of a ULS locale is done by creating a locale
object of the target ULS locale and checking the result (success/failure).
 This validity check is done whenever a Open32 program is started, thus
it slows down the Open32 program st art-up.  Though this is a sure method
to check the availability of ULS locale, it needs to be replaced with a
faster but maybe a less-sure method.
