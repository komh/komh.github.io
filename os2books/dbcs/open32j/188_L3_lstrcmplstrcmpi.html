 According to MSDN (January '96),  this function returns the difference
of the values of the first unequal characters it encounters.  But the actual
result is different from that description. Actually, if the function succeeds
and the string pointed to by<I> lpString1</I> is less than the string pointed
to by<I> lpString2</I>, the return value is '-1'; if the string pointed
to by<I> lpString1</I> is greater than the string pointed to by<I> lpString2</I>,
it is '1'. If the strings are equal, the return value is zero.  This result
is same in WIN95, WIN95 Service Pack1 and WindowsNT 3.51.  Open32 doesn't
follow MSDN, but follow the actual action of these.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

It should be possible to compare strings depends on user language, like
as in WIN95. SBCS Open32 implements this function by using strcmp.  It is
invalid to use strcmp, as user locale or user language determines which
string is greater (or whether the strings are the same.)  This function
gets the sort key by calling LCMapString and compares the result; sort key
array. As for the reason not to use UniStrcoll and UniStrcmpi, see the description
in CompareString.CharLower,CharUpper,CharLowerBuff,CharUpperBuff<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

Conversion by SBCS Open32 is determined by the country / code page of the
current process.  These APIs are modified to be locale-sensitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<P>
Though it depends on the design of user locale in Open32, SBCS Open32 implementation
is wrong.  SBCS Open32 implements this function by using Dos Case Map, which
depends on the specified country code and code page. To convert based on
user locale, ascii string is mapped to wide-character string with using
UniUconvToUcs.  And UniTransLower for CharLower/CharLowerBuff and UniTransUpper
for CharUpper/CharUpperBuff are used.  This string is back to ascii string
with using UniUconvToUcs and this function updates the buffer with this
new ascii string.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
