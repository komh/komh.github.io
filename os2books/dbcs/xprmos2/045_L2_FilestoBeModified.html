<P>
Resource compiler and IPF compiler refer to the<B> COUNTRY.SYS</B> file
which exists in the \OS2\SYSTEM directory. Since current SBCS OS/2 Warp's
COUNTRY.SYS does not contain the latest code page information of DBCS NLVs,
you'll need to replace the file with that of the target OS/2 Warp NLV.  That
is, if you'd like to compile an IPF file written in Hanguel, you need the
COUNTRY.SYS file of OS/2 Warp H.  The exception is Japanese whose code page
information is already contained in the SBCS Warp's COUNTRY.SYS.
<P>
<B>APSYMBOL.APS</B> file, which defines symbols used in IPF source files,
need to be replaced with the appropriate file.  For Japanese, APSYM932.APS
file in the IBM Visual Age C++ for OS/2 can be used, but for the other DBCS
countries, you'll need to copy the files from each toolkit (Refer to <A HREF="049_L2_IPFCInformationPrese.html">IPFC
(Information Presentation Facility Compiler)</A>).
