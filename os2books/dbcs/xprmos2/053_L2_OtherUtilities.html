<P>
Other utilities such as class browser<B> ICSBRS.EXE</B> and performance
analyzer<B> ICPERF.EXE</B> have the PII within their executable modules.
Thus, you can use the SBCS version on the DBCS OS/2. Note that if you have
a DBCS version and run it under the SBCS code page, you would get the garbage,
which would have been DBCS PII, on your screen.
