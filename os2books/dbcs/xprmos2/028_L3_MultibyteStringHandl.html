<P>
A double-byte character always needs to be handled by a two-byte unit. You
should not bisect a double-byte character, and should not mistake the second
byte of a double-byte character for a single-byte character, because the
second byte of a double-byte character can take any hexadecimal value except
00H. If a double-byte character is bisected, you would not be able to tell
whether it is a single-byte character or a part of a double-byte character.
You need to take this rule into consideration when you program routines
for truncation, substring, insertion, substitution and comparison.
<P>
Handling multibyte string is described in the<I> IBM OS/2 DBCS Application
Primer for DBCS OS/2 V2.1(DTCO-0011-2)</I>. Please refer to that document
for the further description and examples.
