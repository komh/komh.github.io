The former achieves ease of translation.  On the other hand, the latter
achieves PII switching at runtime.  This section describes the former, and
the next section will describe the latter case.

쿛II so that PII is isolated from the source code.

<P>
Since a translator is not a programmer in general, it is difficult to distinguish
PII from program codes. Moreover, you need to modify the program whenever
you would need to support an additional language.

PM provides some facilities to generate program resources as an isolated
module. All resources related to panels (e.g. dialog windows, menus and
strings presented onto the panels) can be stored in a<I> resource file</I> which
can be compiled with the resource compiler (refer to <A HREF="048_L2_ResourceComplier.html">Resource
Complier</A>). Help resources can be compiled by IPFC (refer to <A HREF="049_L2_IPFCInformationPrese.html">IPFC
(Information Presentation Facility Compiler)</A>).
<P>
There are many text data which the application need to use other than GUI
part. The sample program of this primer has several data files in text formats
which store products information and customers information used in the program.
In general, such data files are prepared in each country and of course written
in the national language.  Such data files must be designed to accept any
language.
