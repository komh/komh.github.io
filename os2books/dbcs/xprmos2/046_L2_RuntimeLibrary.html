<P>
There are DBCS NLV unique APIs such as  WinDBCSIMEControl().  They are special
APIs to handle DBCS input method, and applications do not use them in general.
 If your application happens to use them, note that the import libraries,
<B>PMNLS286.LIB</B> and<B> PMNLS386.LIB</B> are not contained in the IBM
Visual Age C++ for OS/2.  In such case, you'll need to copy the library
files from IBM Visual Age C++ for OS/2 Japanese version or from Toolkit
for the previous DBCS OS/2.
