쿗ocale databases must be packaged in your product so far as IBM OS/2  
쿥arp does not have the locale mechanism.

<P>
As mentioned before, the locale databases are not a part of IBM OS/2 Warp
at present.  Each product must include these locale databases in the package,
copy appropriate files to the user system, and set appropriate environment
variables such as LOCPATH and LANG or any other categories' names.
<P>
The following shows the locale name for the DBCS countries.

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Japanese code pages, 932 and 942, are very similar
but their locales can not be substituted for each other.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The locale names are not case-sensitive in IBM
Visual Age C++ for OS/2, but it is not guaranteed on other implementation.
For instance, "Ja_JP" and "ja_JP" are different locales on an AIX system.
If an application would be port to the other environment, be sure to compare
the code set name as well when comparing two locale names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
