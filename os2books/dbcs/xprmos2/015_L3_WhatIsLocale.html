<P>
ISO/ANSI C has introduced the notion of a<B><I> locale</B></I> which is
a description of a cultural environment.  XPG4 inherits this notion.
<P>
A locale is the definition of the subset of a user's environment that depends
on language and cultural conventions.  It consists of one or more categories
which correspond to the environment variables and control specific aspects
of the behavior of components of the system.
<P>
The locale categories supported by IBM Visual Age C++ for OS/2 are as follows<A HREF="056_L0_.html">(**)</A>:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
LC_CTYPE<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> defines the character classification, case
conversion and other character attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LC_COLLATE
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>provides collation sequence definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LC_MESSAGES
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>defines the format and values for affirmative and
negative response.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LC_MONETARY<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> defines
the rules and symbols used to format monetary numeric information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LC_NUMERIC
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>defines the rules and symbols used to format non-monetary
numeric information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LC_TIME<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> defines
the interpretation of the field descriptors supported by the date utility.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition, there is a value<B><I> LC_ALL</B></I> which is not one of the
categories but used to refer to all categories.
