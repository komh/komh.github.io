<P>
Even on DBCS OS/2, mnemonic characters are only single-byte characters,
not double-byte characters. Alphabetic characters are usually used as mnemonic
characters. In addition, Japanese OS/2 allows application programs to define
additional mnemonic characters called<B><I> alternative mnemonics</B></I>.
 SBCS Katakana characters are usually assigned to them. Users can dynamically
switch mnemonics to alternative mnemonics in0 System Setup.

mnemonics in addition to the existing mnemonics.  Thus the programmer does
not need to know Japanese. The following shows how to set these mnemonics:

In the above definition, "x" is the mnemonic character and "y" is the alternative
mnemonic character.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
