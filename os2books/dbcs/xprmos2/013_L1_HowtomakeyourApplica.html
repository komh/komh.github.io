<H1>How to make your Application Internationalized?</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
In the previous chapters, you have learned the basic knowledge of XPG4 Internationalization
and IBM OS/2 systems.
<P>
The best way to understand how to internationalize your application programs
is to analyze and copy sample application programs and do some experimental
runs by yourself.  In this chapter, we will show you brief but typical internationalized
PM application programs so that you can quickly learn the basic coding for
internationalization.
