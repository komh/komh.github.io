쿦PG4 is a set of definitions of APIs, command interfaces and          
쿾rogramming languages which makes an application portable across      
쿺ulti-platform and multi-vendor open environment.

XPG4 is a part of CAE (Common Application Environment) which the building
blocks in an open system defined by X/Open on 1992. X/Open (the X/Open Company
Limited) is a UK company which is a consortium formed for creating open
systems specifications.
<P>
XPG4, which is originally stands for<I> X/Open Portability Guide Issue4</I>,
represents an evolving portfolio of API (Application Programming Interface)

<P>
XPG4 covers various areas of operating system from process control to archive
format, but this document focuses on its Internationalization facility only.

쿟he XPG4 Internationalization programming model is an architecture for
쿔nternationalization of applications running on OS/2 Warp.

<P>
Internationalization, which is often abbreviated by<B> I18N</B>, refers
to the process of developing programs without prior knowledge of the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Code page<A HREF="054_L0_.html">(**)</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Cultural convention<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Language<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Code conversion between code-sets<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>For example, the format of date depends on the culture, and user interface
elements such as messages and panels (so-called PII) depend on the language.
An internationalized program, however, does not need to know any date format
or to contain any PII written in a specific language. In other words, an
internationalized program is a culture-neutral object code.
<P>
Localization, which is often abbreviated by<B> L10N</B>, is a process of
establishing information specific to each supported language, cultural convention
and code page combination. L10N adds the language and culture specific information
to the internationalized program.
<P>
At run time, an internationalized program loads appropriate L10N information
dynamically depending on a run time environment (see <A HREF="015_L3_WhatIsLocale.html">What
Is Locale?</A>).
