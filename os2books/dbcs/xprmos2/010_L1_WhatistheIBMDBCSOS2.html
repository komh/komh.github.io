<H1>What is the IBM DBCS OS/2?</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
As mentioned in the previous chapter, we currently have several national
language versions of OS/2. Of course, if an application is internationalized,
the knowledge of the NLV is not necessary for programmers. However, we still
have to use these NLV in the testing phase, and some basic knowledge of
OS/2 is required to read the next chapter, so this chapter describes these
DBCS OS/2 briefly.
<P>
In this chapter, a term "OS/2" is used to represent IBM OS/2 Warp in short.
