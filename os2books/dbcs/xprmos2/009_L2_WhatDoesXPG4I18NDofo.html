<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│XPG4 provides facilities to generate an internationalized application │
│and localized objects.                                                │

<P>
The major facilities of XPG4 Internationalization are listed below:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Access method to a L10N information
<P>
The L10N process generates objects containing information on language and
cultural convention which is called<I> locale</I> (refer to <A HREF="015_L3_WhatIsLocale.html">What
Is Locale?</A>). XPG4 defines API to access the locale objects and utility
to create a new locale.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A data type which can store a<I> character</I>
<P>
The<B> wchar_t</B> data type, which is originated from the C language, is
a key to code page independence. It is an integral type which can store
every member of the largest character set specified among the supported
locales. So far as characters are represented in wchar_t objects, a program
does not need to consider the code page and the encoding scheme. XPG4 defines
various API for handling wchar_t . A program should process all text using
these API. For more details, refer to <A HREF="022_L3_MultiBytevsWideChara.html">Multi
Byte vs. Wide Character</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Code conversion facility
<P>
In a heterogeneous code page environment, an application needs to convert
text data from one code page to another, even within the same language and
country. For example, an OS/2 application accessing to S/390 data may require
such conversion. XPG4 provides code conversion API and utility,<B> iconv</B>,
but this document does not cover them. Please refer to<I> VAC++ Programming
Guide</I> for more details.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Message Catalog system
<P>
One of the keys to language independence is the PII isolation. PII must
be extracted from the executable modules for translatability and for ease
of selecting PII for appropriate language at run time. XPG4 defines the
Message Catalog system for message texts used in an internationalized program,
but OS specific modules such as PM resource files or IPF files are out of
XPG4's scope. This document describes some hints &amp; tips for PM resources
isolation (refer to <A HREF="037_L2_PreparingforPIITrans.html">Preparing
for PII Translation</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
By using these XPG4 facilities, an application can be written in a language
and code page independent manner. As a result, a single executable module
of an application runs equally well on OS/2 in any country configuration
though there are currently several national language versions of OS/2. This
eliminates the need for national language versions, thus reduces the development,
manufacturing and distribution costs.
<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│The selection of Localization features is user-definable through      │
│environment variables.                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>
This mechanism permits the dynamic binding of the locale files. The language
and cultural convention to be referred to by an application is determined
by the end user, not by a system or the application.
<P>
Let's think about the current OS/2 application. Due to the system design,
most of the information on cultural convention is set to a work station,
not to an application. However, by using XPG4 Internationalization facilities,
the application can<!-- entering slot 10 --> use the different cultural
convention even on the same work station by setting the environment variables.

<P>
Please refer to <A HREF="014_L2_IntheBeginningofAlls.html">In the Beginning
of All - setlocale</A> for the description of the environment variables.

│Supporting new environment, encoding scheme, language or culture can  │
│easily be achieved by adding a new locale.                            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
In AP, there are many countries whose national languages need to be supported.
By using XPG4 Internationalization facility, an application can automatically
support a new environment when a new locale is provided.
