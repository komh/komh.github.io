<H1>About this book</H1><!-- entering slot 2 -->
<P>
The IBM OS/2 is an international operating system whose localized editions
are available for Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese
languages.  These localized editions are called OS/2<B> NLV</B> (<I>National
Language Version</I>) altogether.  In this book we attempt to show you how
to implement an internationalized application using XPG4 C functions on
the IBM OS/2 Warp environment.
<P>
This book is based on each NLV of the IBM OS/2 Warp together with IBM Visual
Age C++ for OS/2, and may not be 100% applicable to any other releases.
 We intend this guide primarily for Presentation Manager application programs,
although some of the topics covered in this book are applicable to full-screen
and text-windowed application programs as well.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This book features<B> XPG4</B> (<I>X/Open Portability Guide
Issue 4</I>) C functions, and some of NLS/DBCS related facilities provided
by IBM OS/2 Warp are not covered.  However, some of the sample programs
referred in this document are taken out from the other application primer,
<I>IBM OS/2 DBCS Application Primer for DBCS OS/2 V2.1(DTCO-0011-2)</I>,
which explains how to implement DBCS-enabled application by using OS/2 native
functions only.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
