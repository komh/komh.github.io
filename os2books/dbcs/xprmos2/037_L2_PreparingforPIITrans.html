<P>
There are many PII (<I>Program Integrated Information</I>) used in an application
program.  Some of them may be formatted by programming tools such as Resource
Compiler and IPF Compiler.  Some of them may be stored in a database.  Some
of them may be just text files.  The information should be presented in
the users' native languages so that they can understand easily. For example,
Korean users would appreciate messages in Hanguel.
