<H1>Difference between SBCS OS/2 and DBCS OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│DBCS OS/2 is a common name for OS/2 NLVs that IBM provides to the Asia│
│Pacific countries requiring the DBCS character set. In general, DBCS  │
│OS/2 is released following the release-up of SBCS OS/2.               │

<P>
SBCS OS/2 is the base of DBCS OS/2. Therefore, DBCS OS/2 inherits many components
from SBCS OS/2. In addition, the following capabilities are added to DBCS
OS/2 for DBCS support:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DBCS OS/2 supports DBCS countries' unique hardwares
such as keyboards and printers.  DBCS OS/2 supports US 101 keyboard and
some SBCS printers as well (<A HREF="055_L0_.html">(**)</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SBCS and DBCS character support
<P>
Though DBCS OS/2 is designed for DBCS languages, it supports not only DBCS
but also SBCS.  Code page IDs used in DBCS OS/2 represent combinations of
SBCS and DBCS code page.  These code pages are called<B> combined code page</B>.
 The SBCS code pages for DBCS OS/2 include alphanumeric characters and special
symbols in addition to the ones in SBCS code pages used on SBCS OS/2.
<P>
The difference between an SBCS code page used on DBCS OS/2 and the one used
on SBCS OS/2 are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the former reserves code areas for the first bytes
of DBCS characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the former includes unique phonetic characters used
in DBCS language (in case of Japanese).<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->National use characters are assigned to 5CH and 7EH.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DBCS input
method support
<P>
There are too many ideographic characters to assign to key-tops. This requires
DBCS-unique input mechanisms called IME (Input Method Editor).  For example,
<I>Kana to Kanji conversion method</I> is a DBCS input method for Japanese.
 Each DBCS NLV of OS/2 supports its own IME appropriate to the language
characteristics.
<P>
IME is transparent from an application programs.  The application receives
the converted data as well as usual SBCS data so far as it uses PM functions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Messages, menus, and dialog
panels in Asian Languages
<P>
Messages, dialog panels, and menus on OS/2 are translated into Asian languages
for better readability for Asian users.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Font

<P>
Fonts for combined code pages are added to SBCS fonts in order to present
double-byte characters.  In user's DBCS OS/2 environment, more than one
raster font for combined code pages are, at least, installed.  This is the
only one fact you can assume during application programming.<B> Do not assume
anything else on the fonts such as face names, various values of font sizes,
or availability of out-line fonts.</B>
<P>
On DBCS OS/2 Warp, users can change the default System font to others, although
they cannot do so on SBCS OS/2 V2.1.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
