쿟he wide character testing functions starting with isw, are           
퀇ide-character versions of the character testing functions starting   
퀇ith <I>is</I>.

<P>
The C language has provided character testing functions such as the<B> isprint()
</B>and the<B> isalpha()</B> functions. However, they can not be used to
test DBCS characters since the argument accepts SBCS only <A HREF="059_L0_.html">(**)</A>.

<P>
The<B> isw*</B> functions accept<I> wint_t</I> instead of<I> int</I>, which
should be a wide character plus a WEOF wide character. The functions are
locale sensitive, so they can test classifications of DBCS characters as
well as SBCS characters after converting to them wchar_t.  In the Japanese
locale, there are DBCS alphabetic characters as well as SBCS ones. The<B> iswalpha()
</B>function returns TRUE for both SBCS and DBCS alphabets if the current
locale is "ja_jp".

쿟he <B>towlower()</B> and the <B>towupper()</B> functions are wide-character        
퀆ersions of the tolower() and the toupper() functions.

<P>
The tolower() and the toupper() functions supports SBCS characters only.
Like the correspondence of the isxxx() functions and the iswxxx() functions,
wide character versions, the<B> towlower()</B> and<B> towupper()</B> are
available.
<P>
The characters classification referred by the<B> iswxxx()</B> and the<B> towxxx()
</B>functions are defined in the LC_CTYPE category of a locale.

쿌 useful extension of XPG4 is that it provides an interface to define 
쿪nd test locale specific character classes.

<P>
There may be unique character classes in each language in addition to the
standard classes such as alpha and digit.  For example, Korean has phonetic
characters, "Hanguel", and Japanese has phonetic characters, "Katakana"
and "Hiragana". XPG4 provides a method to describe such unique character
classes in a locale database.  The<B> wctype()</B> function is used to query
the class name and the<B> iswctype</B> function is used to test a wide character.
