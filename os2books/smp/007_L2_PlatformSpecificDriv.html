<P>
The PSD operates in three contexts (modes): Kernel, Interrupt, and Init.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Kernel Mode</B>
<P>
The OS/2 kernel calls the PSD for task-time operations, that is, it will
execute as a thread within a process. Kernel mode is also referred to as
the task context.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Interrupt
Mode</B>
<P>
The OS/2 kernel calls the PSD for interrupt-time operations. Interrupt time
is a generic term that refers to executing code as a result of a hardware
interrupt. The code does not execute as a thread belonging to a process.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL><B>Init Mode</B>
<P>
The PSD is currently being used for system initialization. A limited set
of PSD helps are available for use.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
PSDs may contain multiple code and data objects. All objects will be fixed
(not-swappable or movable) in low physical memory, with virtual addresses
in the system arena. Objects are loaded in low physical memory to facilitate
the use of real mode or bi-modal code. All objects default to permanent,
which means that they remain in the system after initialization is completed.
The SEGMENTS directive and the IOPL option in the linker DEF file should
be used to mark those objects that are not to be kept after initialization.

<P>
The multitasking/multiprocessing environment of OS/2 for SMP V2.11 dictates
that the PSD must be capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously.
This means that global variables should be used sparingly. Upon PSD installation,
the kernel passes a pointer to a small area of processor local memory (PLMA)
which the PSD developer can use to store variables. PSD developers must
be aware of the effects of the calls they make, because there is no guarantee
that if an operation is started on a processor, and execution blocks, that
the operation will continue on the same processor. OS/2 does not preempt
a thread in the PSD, but it may block as a result of using a PSD help, or
it may be interrupted by a hardware interrupt.
<P>
PSDs can register an interrupt handler for any given IRQ level using the
SET_IRQ PSD help. These interrupt handlers are guaranteed to be called before
any device driver's interrupt handler. If the PSD's interrupt handler returns
NO_ERROR, the interrupt manager will assume the interrupt has been handled,
it will end the interrupt. If a -1 is returned, the interrupt manager will
assume that the interrupt has not been handled, and will call each device
driver which has a registered interrupt handler for that particular level
until one claims the interrupt. If the interrupt is unclaimed, the IRQ level
will be masked off.
<P>
All PSDs must use the SET_IRQ PSD help to indicate which IRQ level they
will be using for inter-processor interrupts (IPI). If the PSD's IPI IRQ
level is shared, it must register a handler which detects if the IRQ is
an IPI or another interrupt. The handler must return NO_ERROR if the interrupt
was caused by an IPI, otherwise it returns a -1. If the IPI IRQ level is
unique, an interrupt handler need not be installed but SET_IRQ must still
be used to indicate which is the IPI IRQ level.
<P>
The kernel will save the state of all the registers (except EAX) around
calls to the PSD functions. All the functions will run at Ring 0. Upon invocation,
SS, DS, and ES will be flat. The PSD functions must conform to the C calling
convention. They receive parameters on the stack (4 bytes<!-- entering slot 8 --> per
parameter), and must return a return code in EAX.
<P>
The PSD functions have been split into three categories:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> Functions that the PSD must have for OS/2 to operate
(required functions)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> Functions that the PSD does not need to have
(optional functions)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> Functions that the PSD must have for OS/2
to use multiple processors (MP functions).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The kernel provides default handling for some of the PSD functions. PSD
functions can also chain to a kernel default handler by returning a -1 return
code. If a return code other than -1 is returned by a PSD function, the
default handler will not get called. The PSD function glossary later in
this chapter details the categories of all the functions, as well as any
default handlers they may have.
<P>
The PSD developer makes functions available to OS/2 by using the EXPORTS
statement in the module definition (DEF) file. All functions should be exported
using upper case with no leading underscores (_). An example is shown below.

<PRE>  LIBRARY TESTPSD

  EXPORTS

     PSD_INSTALL   = _Install
     PSD_DEINSTALL = _DeInstall

</PRE>

<P>
The initial CS and EIP in the PSD's executable image is ignored. The image
should also not contain a stack object. OS/2 allocates a per-processor PSD
stack and sets SS and ESP correctly before invoking any of the PSD functions.

<P>
PSDs should be written in flat 32-bit code, using C, and must be linked
as a LIBRARY.
<P>
OS/2 invokes all PSD functions in protect mode, but there is also a PSD
help which allows the PSD developer to call a PSD function in real mode.

<P>
OS/2 services are provided through the PSD help interface. Access to these
services are obtained upon PSD installation. PSD helpers preserve all registers
except EAX.
<P>
All the definitions (e.g. defines, structures, etc.) that are required for
building a PSD are in the header file PSD.H.
