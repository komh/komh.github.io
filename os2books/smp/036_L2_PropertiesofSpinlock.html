<P>
It is important to note the differences in the various types of spinlocks.

<P>
Properties of kernel spinlocks:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can have nested ownership.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can use a level to enforce a lock hierarchy.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can not be owned while outside of the kernel.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>can only be owned for very short periods of
time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

There is a different type of spinlock which is exported to subsystems. These
locks are used to provide an efficient MP safe CLI/STI substitute for protecting
data structures that are shared between task-time and interrupt-time code.

</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>each processor can hold only one subsystem
spinlock at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

A suspend lock, is defined such that an attempt to acquire a suspend lock
which is currently owned by another processor places the current thread
into a blocked state, and causes a reschedule. The thread's which are blocked
on suspend locks will awaken when the lock is released. Suspend locks are
only used inside the kernel.
<P>
Properties of a kernel suspend lock:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can have nested ownership.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>can use a level to enforce a lock hierarchy.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can not be owned while outside of the kernel.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can be owned for long periods of time.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>can not block while owning a suspend lock.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
When a spinlock is acquired, the lock manager automatically saves the state
of the interrupt flag, then disables interrupts before returning to the
caller. It restores the state of the interrupt flag when the lock is released.
The kernel will panic if an interrupt is taken while owning a spinlock.
