<H1>Device Drivers In OS/2 for SMP V2.11</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
This chapter describes the impacts to driver writers when writing device
drivers for OS/2 for SMP V2.11.
<P>
Existing device drivers should run on OS/2 for SMP V2.11 without modifications
providing two simple rules are followed:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The driver must call DevHlp EOI to perform an EOI.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The driver must not mask or unmask interrupts
directly.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
OS/2 2.x device drivers were written with only 8259 architecture in mind.
The code that is most commonly executed in a device driver is to send the
End Of Interrupt (EOI) command to the 8259. There is a system interface
for do this, however, for performance reasons some device drivers have decided
to implement this function directly. Additionally, some device drivers may
MASK or UNMASK interrupts or read the 8259 registers to determine the interrupt
state.
