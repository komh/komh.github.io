<H1>Use of CLI/STI</H1><!-- entering slot 57 -->
<P>
As stated above, CLI/STI will only work on the processor on which they execute.
Therefore, only the same processor will be protected from "stepping" on
a protected resource. For example, assume the application maintains a linked
list of I/O packets for a device. Whenever packets are inserted or removed,
the list must be protected as a critical resource. Under the uniprocessor
model, a CLI/STI around the manipulation of the list would be sufficient
protection. However, in an MP environment, the CLI/STI would only protect
the resource on the same processor. Another processor could enter a section
of code that attempted to manipulate the linked list. The results would
be unpredictable. Possibilities would range from no effect to deadlock.
Code that uses CLI/STI is not reliable and should be eliminated.
<P>
The solution is to replace CLI/STIs with spinlocks. Each critical resource
will have associated with it a spinlock. Before accessing the resource the
spinlock must be acquired, and when complete, the spinlock is released.
