<H1>Interrupt Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 62 -->
<P>
Interrupt processing should not be affected, except by the need to lock
spinlocks for critical resources. When a spinlock is locked, the LockManger
will disable interrupts before returning to the device driver. This insures
that no interrupt will occur, on the same processor, between when the spinlock
is requested and when the kernel returns to the device driver with the spinlock
locked. (The same level of function accomplished by a CLI on a single processor
system). The device driver MUST leave interrupts disabled while owning the
spinlock. If interrupts were enabled a deadlock could occur.  Consider the
following:
<PRE>

      Task Time                           Int Time

   (ints enabled)
   Lock spinlock1
   STI
                   ---Interrupt---&gt;     Lock spinlock1
                                        some processing
                                        Unlock spinlock1
                                        EOI
                   &lt;-- Return from Int
   Some processing
   Unlock spinlock1
</PRE>

<P>
In the above example the the task time and interrupt code are running on
the same processor. When the task time code locks spinlock1 with interrupts
enabled the LockManager will return with interrupts disabled. If interrupts
were enabled after the lock with the STI instruction, then the interrupt
code on the right could run. The first thing the interrupt handler does
is try to grab spinlock1. Because spinlock1 is already locked, the interrupt
handler will spin. The lock, however, will never become available. The task
time code will not run until the interrupt code completes. The result is
deadlock. This is why it is important to leave interrupts disabled while
owning a spinlock.
<P>
Consider the same code above, but with the task time code running on processor
A and the interrupt code running on processor B. For this example, however,
interrupts remain disabled (remove the STI). Because the LockManager disables
interrupts, processor B will run the interrupt code. When the interrupt
code attempts to get the spinlock, it will spin. Because processor A continues
executing, the spinlock will be released, thereby allowing the interrupt
code on processor B to acquire the spinlock and continue execution.  Deadlock
is avoided. When processor A returns from the unlock the state of the interrupt
flag will be restored by the LockManager to its state before the lock was
done.
<P>
Another action the device driver must avoid is issuing its own EOI. All
EOIs must use the DevHelp_EOI device helper service. The reason for this
is that different multiprocessor platforms have defined their own advanced
interrupt controllers. Without detailed knowledge of the controller and
how it operates, and knowledge of how the kernel is using the controller,
the device driver can cause unpredictable results, including deadlock. All
MP-aware device drivers must use the EOI service.
