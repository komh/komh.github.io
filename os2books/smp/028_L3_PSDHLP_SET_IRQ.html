<UL> Setup IRQ information.
<P>
This function is used to setup IRQ information.
<P>
The PSD can use this help to register an interrupt handler at any given
IRQ level between IRQ 0-IRQ 1F. These interrupt handler's are guaranteed
to be called before any device driver's interrupt handler. If the PSD's
interrupt handler returns NO_ERROR, the interrupt manager will assume the
interrupt has been handled, and it will end the interrupt. If a -1 is returned,
the interrupt manager will assume that the interrupt has not been handled,
and will call each device driver which has a registered interrupt handler
for that particular level, until one claims the interrupt. If the interrupt
is unclaimed, the IRQ level will be masked off.
<P>
All PSDs must use the SET_IRQ PSD help to indicate which IRQ level it will
be using for its inter-processor interrupts (IPI). If the PSD's IPI IRQ
level is shared, it must register a handler which detects if the IRQ is
an IPI or another interrupt. The handler must return NO_ERROR if the interrupt
was caused by an IPI, otherwise, it returns a -1. If the IPI IRQ level is
unique, an interrupt handler need not be installed, but SET_IRQ must still
be used to indicate the IPI IRQ level.
<P>
This function can also be used to set, or remap what interrupt vector a
particular IRQ level will use.
