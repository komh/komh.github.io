<H1>New Kernel Debugger Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 74 -->
<P>
The Kernel debugger architecture is such that only one thread can be in
the debugger at any given time, so it uses a spinlock to serialize its access.

<P>
If entered, the debugger must inform the user as to the state of all the
processors, even though the other processors are still executing code. It
accomplishes this by sending a spin command using and IPI (interprocessor
interrupt) to all the other processors. When a processor receives a spin
command sent by the kernel debugger, it saves its current state (all of
its registers), acknowledges the spin command, and spins until released.
This allows the user to switch to a slot which is currently executing on
another processor and determines what it is doing.
<P>
All kernel debugger commands work as before, but a few have been modified
to display or use MP specific information, and new MP specific commands
have been added.
<P>
A list of new and changed commands follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>A<B> .DP</B> (processor status) command has been
added. This command dumps out a processor control block verbosely.  As an
argument it takes a * (real current slot), a # (currently selected slot),
and a 1 based processor number (e.g.<B> .DP 3</B> displays the processor
status for processor 3), or a blank (e.g.<B> .DP</B> ) which displays the
processor status for all the processors.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>A
<B>.DL</B> (display processor spinlocks) command has been added. This command
displays all the spinlocks owned by a particular processor. As an argument
it takes a * (real current slot), a # (currently selected slot), a 1 based
processor number (e.g.<B> .DL 3</B> displays all the spinlocks owned by
processor 3), an address of a spinlock, or a blank which displays all the
spinlocks owned by all the processors.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The
<B>.R</B> and the<B> R</B> (register commands) have been modified to indicate
which processor the currently selected slot is running on. A p=xxyy (xx
= processor number, yy = flags) has been added to the end of the third register
line. These processor numbers are 1- based (e.g. p=00 means that the currently
selected slot is not running on any processor or is blocked, p=01 means
the currently selected slot is running on processor 1). The flags are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>s</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> processor is currently spinning.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><B>r</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> processor is attempting to grab the
ring 0 suspend lock.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The
<B>.SS</B> (change current slot) has been modified to change which PSA (process
or save area) you are currently looking at (e.g. when you change to a slot
which is currently running on a different processor and dump a variable
in the PSA, it will display the value of that variable on that particular
processor).  The<B> .S</B> command is now identical to the<B> .SS</B> command.
The PLMA is displayed properly for each processor.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
