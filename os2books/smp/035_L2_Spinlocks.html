<P>
The defined mechanism for protection of critical resources in OS/2 MP is
a spinlock.  A spinlock is a serialization mechanism that is used to restrict
access to a critical resource to the owner of the spinlock.  Spinlocks are
implemented in the LockManager, which is part of the kernel, and are manipulated
by using the new MPHelper services.  The act of acquiring a spinlock can
be thought of as locking the spinlock.
<P>
The reason spinlocks are used for critical resource protection instead of
disabling interrupts, is disabling interrupts no longer works in an MP environment.
CLI and STI will only work on the processor on which the instruction is
executing. It will not prevent another processor from executing task time
or interrupt code from the same device driver. Even though the kernel is
non-preemptive, another processor can enter the kernel, and hence a device
driver at any time. That means that CLI will not provide the same protection
as on a single processor system. CLI/STI must be avoided.
<P>
MP aware device drivers will use spinlocks to protect critical resources.
A spinlock must be allocated for each critical resource. Spinlock allocation
should be done during initialization. When access to the resource is required,
the device driver will try to lock the spinlock for the resource. If the
spinlock is already locked then the processor will "spin" waiting for the
lock to become available. Once the spinlock is acquired (locked) the device
driver has exclusive access to the critical resource. The spinlock should
remain locked for a VERY short time. When done with the resource the spinlock
is released (unlocked).
<P>
Because spinlocks are for VERY SHORT durations, interrupts must be disabled
while a spinlock is locked. If interrupts were enabled the path of execution
could be expanded indefinitely by interrupt handlers. To enforce this rule,
the LockManager will save the state of the interrupt flag and disable interrupts
when a spinlock is locked. When the spinlock is unlocked, the LockManager
will restore the interrupt flag to his original state. This allows device
drivers to be unaware of the interrupt flag state while locking and unlocking
spinlocks. The device driver, however, must not enable interrupts while
owning a spinlock. If interrupts were enabled there are two possible effects.
First is the uncontrolled expansion of the time a spinlock is owned. Second
is the possibility of deadlock.
<P>
A spinlock is defined such that an attempt to acquire a spinlock which is
currently owned by another processor, makes you spin (i.e. a tight loop
of code which waits for the spinlock to be released). Spinlocks should be
used sparingly, and should only be owned for very short periods of time,
as spinning prevents the processor from doing any additional work. Spinlocks
have different properties depending on whether it is a kernel or device
driver spinlock. Spinlocks have been used because it is more expensive to
reschedule a thread that is trying to acquire a spinlock than it would be
waiting for the lock to clear.
