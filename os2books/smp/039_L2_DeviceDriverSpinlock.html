<H1>Device Driver Spinlocks</H1><!-- entering slot 40 -->
<P>
The device driver should protect access to critical resources using spinlocks.
The device driver allocates spinlocks in the Init routine by calling DevHlp_CreateSpinLock.
CreateSpinLock returns a handle for use by the device driver. This handle
is passed to DevHlp_AcquireSpinLock and DevHlp_ReleaseSpinLock. The spinlock
is freed by calling DevHlp_FreeSpinLock. The driver may request any number
of spinlocks, as the spinlocks are represented by a very small data structure.
Once created, the spinlocks never go away.
<P>
As was outlined previously, OS/2 for SMP V2.11 contains a layer of abstraction
for any functions that are deemed platform specific. These functions are
placed inside the Platform Specific Driver (PSD) and isolate device drivers
from the particular hardware platform that they are running on. At boot
time, OS/2 determines and loads the appropriate PSD for the MP system hardware
it is currently running on.
<P>
All device drivers that are MP-safe must use the appropriate kernel services
to do hardware specific functions. The kernel will route these requests
to the PSD for processing.
<P>
Device drivers in OS/2 2.x were written with the concept that only one processor
can generate interrupts. But with OS/2 for SMP V2.11 other processors can
now generate interrupts, so device drivers should account for re-entrance
and parallel execution of task-time and interrupt-time code.
