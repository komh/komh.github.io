<H1>Overview of OS/2 for SMP Version 2.11</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
This document provides a guide for developers writing applications and device
drivers for OS/2 for Symmetrical Multiprocessing (SMP) V2.11.
<P>
OS/2 for SMP V2.11 was developed to satisfy the need to run OS/2 on multiprocessor
based CISC processors, namely the Intel x86 compatible family. The requirements
for OS/2 for SMP V2.11 were that it run all existing applications, device
drivers and subsystems, as well as take advantage of new multiprocessor
(MP) exploitive applications and device drivers.
<P>
The emergence of low-cost MP hardware based on the 486 and Pentium processors
makes OS/2 for SMP V2.11 an attractive desktop operating environment. Server
and workstation environments using the x86 architecture are moving toward
the more powerful emerging RISC based chip sets. These new RISC processors
lack the full range of programming tools available for the x86 chip set.
OS/2 for SMP V2.11 attempts to solve the problems of insufficient processor
bandwidth by supporting multiple x86 processors in a single computer.
<P>
To provide increased performance, OS/2 for SMP V2.11 allows applications,
file system, mass storage and network drivers to execute on any processor
at any time. A number of databases and applications have been converted
to run OS/2 for SMP V2.11. DB2/2 and CICS are two databases that IBM has
converted to run under OS/2 for SMP V2.11. These application can benefit
greatly from OS/2 for SMP V2.11 because they are CPU-intensive. Other applications
which can also benefit from OS/2 for SMP V2.11 are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
