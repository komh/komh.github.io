<P>
One possible cause of deadlock stems from taking spinlocks in different
orders in different sections of code. Consider the following two sections
of code, each executing on a separate processor at the same time. For both
examples all locks are available when the code begins execution.
<PRE>
        Code section 1              Code section 2


     1  Lock spinlock1           1  Lock spinlock2
     2  Do some processing       2  Do some processing
     3  Lock spinlock2           3  Lock spinlock1
     4  More processing          4  More processing
     5  Unlock spinlock2         5  Unlock spinlock1
     6  Unlock spinlock1         6  Unlock spinlock2

</PRE>

<P>
In section 1 line 1 locks spinlock1.  In section 2 line 1 locks spinlock2.
Both sections will successfully lock their respective locks and continue
normally. Now section 1 on line 3 tries to lock spinlock2, which is already
locked by section 2, so section 1 spins. Now section 2 tries to lock spinlock1
(line 3), which is already locked by section 1, so section 2 now spins.
Now each section of code is spinning waiting for a lock that the other owns.
The result is deadlock. Neither section of code will ever continue executing
and will therefore never release the spinlock that the other needs. This
kind of deadlock is very common, but can be avoided by always taking spinlocks
that are related in the same order.
<P>
To fix the above code, code section 2 would be recoded to the following:

<PRE>
       Code section 2


    1  Lock spinlock1
    2  Lock spinlock2
    3  Do some processing
    4  More processing
    5  Unlock spinlock2
    6  Unlock spinlock1

</PRE>

<P>
By taking the locks in the same order as code section 1 the deadlock potential
is eliminated. Both sections can no longer be waiting on a resource the
other owns at the same time. It should be noted that spinlocks should be
released in the reverse order that they are locked.
