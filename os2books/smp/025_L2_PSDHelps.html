<P>
OS/2 provides system services to the PSD developer via PSD helps.
<P>
The address of the PSD help router is passed in the INSTALL structure when
a PSD's install function is called. All PSD helps destroy the contents of
the EAX register (used for a return code). All other registers, including
the flags, are preserved.
<P>
To invoke a PSD help, set up the appropriate parameters and call the PSD
help router. For an example, refer to Appendix A. Some prototypes and macros
are defined in PSD.H to simplify their usage.
