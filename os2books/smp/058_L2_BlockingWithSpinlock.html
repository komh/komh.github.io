<H1>Blocking With Spinlocks Locked</H1><!-- entering slot 59 -->
<P>
Another cause of deadlock is blocking with locked spinlocks. Consider the
following two sections of code. Section 1 is a task time operation that
needs an interrupt to complete. Section 2 is the interrupt code that will
execute and unblock section 1.
<PRE>
      Code section 1                  Code section 2
      (Task time)                     (Interrupt time)

      Lock spinlock1                  interrupt received
      start I/O                       lock spinlock1
      block (ProcBlock)               unblock (ProcRun)
                                      release spinlock1
      return from block
      some processing
         (may include a re-block)
      release spinlock1

</PRE>

<P>
In the above example code section 1 locks spinlock1 and then blocks (with
the spinlock still locked). Code section 2 will then execute when the I/O
completes. The interrupt code first tries to lock spinlock1. Because spinlock1
is already locked, the interrupt code will spin waiting for the lock. The
lock will never become available, however, because the only way for the
spinlock to be unlocked is for section 1 to be unblocked. But the interrupt
code, which is responsible for the unblock, can't continue until it acquires
the spinlock. The result is deadlock.
<P>
Now the first attempt to solve this problem may be to recode section 1 with
the following:
<PRE>
     Lock spinlock1
     start I/O
     release spinlock1
     block (ProcBlock)

     return from block
     lock spinlock1
     some processing
     release spinlock1

</PRE>

<P>
The above code sequence appears to correct the problem. It does not, however,
and can also result in a deadlock. The reason is that there exists a window
between where the code releases the spinlock and the thread is blocked in
which an interrupt can occur. Remember that disabling interrupts no longer
prevents interrupts from happening. If an interrupt fires in this window,
the interrupt handler (section 2 above) will run. It will acquire the spinlock
and attempt to unblock the thread. The thread, however, has not actually
blocked yet. When the thread finally does block, the wakeup event has already
occurred. The result once again is deadlock.
<P>
To solve this particular problem, DevHelp_Block has been modified to release
ALL spinlocks that are owned on the current processor. The device driver
should call DevHelp_Block with spinlocks locked. The kernel will first put
the thread of execution in the blocked state. Then, before dispatching the
next thread, it will release all locked spinlocks for the current processor.
Because the thread is in the blocked state, it is valid for another processor
to execute interrupt code that will do the DevHelp_Run. The result is no
deadlock. The code sequences from above should be re-coded to the following
to avoid the deadlock:
<PRE>
      Code section 1                  Code section 2

      Lock spinlock1                  interrupt received
      start I/O                       lock spinlock1
      While(block required)           unblock (ProcRun)
         Block                        release spinlock1
         return from block
         Lock spinlock1
      EndWhile
      some processing
      release spinlock1

</PRE>

<P>
The above example has been expanded to include the steps required to insure
that when the thread is woken up, that the blocking condition is satisfied
before execution continues. This code sequence is analogous to that listed
in the description for DevHlp_Block in the Device Helper Services chapter
of the Physical Device Driver Reference. It has been modified to use spinlocks
instead of disabling interrupts (which will not work).
<P>
Once again this list is not exhaustive, but is a representation of the majority
of cases that can cause deadlock. By avoiding these situations the chances
of deadlock are reduced considerably. In addition, there are certain system
level checks performed to help insure that deadlock is avoided. If the system
detects a situation that could cause deadlock, such as attempting to block
while owing a spinlock, it will panic the system and print an<!-- entering slot 60 --> internal
processing error message.
