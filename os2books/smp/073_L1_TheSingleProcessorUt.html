<H1>The Single Processor Utility Program</H1><!-- entering slot 75 -->
<P>
As explained previously, some applications written for uniprocessor OS/2
may experience problems running under OS/2 for SMP V2.11 because they rely
upon priorities between threads for accessing shared resources, or use the
CLI/STI method for protecting resources like semaphores or memory. These
types of application are called MP-safe. These programs will still run fine
under OS/2 for SMP V2.11 if they are run in a uniprocessor mode.
<P>
The EXECMODE program is a utility which marks the executable (EXE) file
to be run in a uniprocessor mode. The OS/2 loader detects this bit set and
forces the application to run on a single processor. The EXECMODE utility
can be used to set and reset the uniprocessor mode in an executable file,
as well as list those programs that are marked as MP or SP.
<P>
The syntax for the EXECMODE utility program is as follows:
<PRE>
 execmode (options)[d:[\[path\]]]filenam1.ext( options) [filenam2.ext]...

</PRE>

<P>
The EXECMODE program accepts several command line options. Each option must
be preceeded by a "/" or a "-".<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
