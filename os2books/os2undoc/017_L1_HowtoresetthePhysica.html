<H1>How to reset the Physical Palette</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->Getting the 256-color mode palette manager to set
itself up is not too hard, but getting it to reset itself to the default
palette is not documented well. In the header file 'DIVE.H' is a nice piece
of explanation:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<PRE>Neither DiveSetSourcePalette nor DiveSetDestinationPalette API's will set
the physical palette.  If your application MUST set the PHYSICAL palette,
try using no more than 236 entries (the middle 236: 10-245, thus leaving
the top and bottom 10 entries for the Workplace Shell).  If your
application MUST use ALL 256 entries, it must do so as a full-screen
(i.e. maximized) application.  Remember, No WM_REALIZEPALETTE message
will be sent to other running applications, meaning they will not redraw
and their colors will be all wrong.  It is not recommended that a
developer use these commands:

To set physical palette, do the following:

   hps = WinGetPS ( HWND_DESKTOP );
   hdc = GpiQueryDevice ( hps );
   GpiCreateLogColorTable ( hps, LCOL_PURECOLOR | LCOL_REALIZABLE,
      LCOLF_CONSECRGB, 0, 256, (PLONG)plRGB2Entries );
   DiveSetPhysicalPalette ( hDiveInst, hdc );
   GreRealizeColorTable ( hdc ) ;
   WinInvalidateRect ( HWND_DESKTOP, (PRECTL)NULL, TRUE );
   WinReleasePS ( hps );

To reset physical palette, do the following:

   hps = WinGetPS ( HWND_DESKTOP ) ;
   hdc = GpiQueryDevice ( hps ) ;
   GreUnrealizeColorTable ( hdc ) ;
   WinInvalidateRect ( HWND_DESKTOP, (PRECTL)NULL, TRUE );
   WinReleasePS ( hps ) ;

</UL>I have altered these examples slightly for clarity, replacing the Gre32Entry3
function calls with macros defined in 'PMDDIM.H'.
