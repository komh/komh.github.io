<H1>HPFS Large Disk Access</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->DosRead/Write in direct-access mode will normally
fail if the partition is greater than four gigabytes in size.  If you wish
to write an HPFS editor or other tool, you will need to know the "secret
password" that unlocks the big disks.  After you use DosOpen to get a handle
to that volume, use FSCTL FSC_SECTORIO (0x9014) and in the parameter list,
put a pointer to 0xDEADFACE.  Doing so will put the handle in "sector" mode.
 All offsets and sizes will refer to sectors instead of bytes, allowing
you to address 64Gb.
