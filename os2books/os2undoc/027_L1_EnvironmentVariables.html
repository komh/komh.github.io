<H1>Environment Variables</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->There are a number of undocumented environment
variables that change the behavior of the system.  These are a few of them:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>COPYFROMFLOPPY=1 - You have replaced one or more of the files on the
installation floppies, and you have successfully booted the installer in
spite of your strange hardware.  The installation proceeds, but it pulls
in replacements to what you just replaced from either the later compressed
diskettes, or from the CD.  When the first phase of installation completes
and the system reboots from the hard drive, you find that you no longer
are using the replacement drivers.  If you add this line to the CONFIG.SYS
on install diskette 1 (before Warp 4.0) or on install diskette 2 (Warp 4.0
or later), then the installer will reload the replacement files from the
early floppies before rebooting.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>KILLFEATUREENABLED=ON - This enables the display of the full process
list from WarpCenter by clicking on the task list button while pressing
the Control key.  Selecting a program from the list pops up a message box
to confirm the killing of the process.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>MENUSFOLLOWPOINTER=ON - This makes the WarpCenter menus (but no others)
behave more like the Start menu of Windows, in that once you open the menu,
the menu selection will follow the mouse without your needing to keep the
mouse button pressed down.  Submenus will automatically open as you move
the mouse pointer over them.  This function only works on Warp 4.0 with
fixpack 5 or later.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SCCANBENUKED=ON - Allows the WarpCenter to have a Delete option on its
context menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SCFINDUTILITY=c:\os2\apps\pmseek.exe - This changes the function of
the Find button on the WarpCenter to use PMSEEK instead of the limited-function
default file finder.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SCKILLCONFIRMDISABLED=ON - ??<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SCKILLFEATUREENABLED=ON - This is the same as KILLFEATUREENABLED=ON.
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SCPRETTYCLOCK=1 - This changes the appearance of the WarpCenter clock,
giving it a fancier border, a black background and green numbers.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>SHELLHANDLESINC= - This environment variable increments the number of
file handles available to the Shell process (protshell). Users who need
more file handles can add this statement to CONFIG.SYS.  The maximum file
handles will be incremented by the amount specified in the statement.  The
system defaults to 20 file handles in the Shell process.  Therefore, if
the statement specifies a 10, then the total would be incremented to 30.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
