<H1>Undocumented extensions to Event Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->It is possible to do a post that releases one thread
at a time as of fixpack 29 for Warp 3 and fixpack 4 for Warp 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>define DCE_AUTORESET 0x1000 // Auto-reset event semaphore<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI>define DCE_POSTONE  0x0800 // Post one flag<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>This feature only slightly changes the API
of DosCreateEventSem.  Other APIs for event semaphores are kept the same,
although their behaviors are changed.
<P>
DosCreateEventSem:
<P>
 The flags argument can specify the new behaviors of the event semaphore:
DCE_AUTORESET means the event automatically resets itself after a thread
obtains it through DosWaitEventSem, and DCE_POSTONE means that DosPostEventSem
only wakes up one waiting thread if there is any. When DCE_POSTONE is specified,
the event always automatically resets even if DCE_AUTORESET is not specified.
 We can define three types of events with these two flags:
<P>
Neither DCE_AUTORESET nor DCE_POSTONE set:  The event has default behavior,
which needs manual resets and wakes up all waiters when posted.
<P>
DCE_AUTORESET set but not DCE_POSTONE: The event resets it after a wait
is successfully executed.  It wakes up all waiters when posted.
<P>
DCE_POSTONE set: The event resets it automatically after a wait is successfully
executed. But it only wakes up one waiter when posted.
<P>
DosWaitEventSem:
<P>
 For an AUTORESET event, it automatically resets itself after this is successfully
executed. Otherwise, it leaves the event in signalled (posted) state.
<P>
DosPostEventSem:
<P>
 For a POSTONE event, it wakes up only one waiter if there is any thread
waiting for the event.  Otherwise, it wakes up all events.
