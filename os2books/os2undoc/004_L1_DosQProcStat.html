<P>
 This function is a slightly altered version of the function of the same
name that was present in OS/2 1.x, and which formed the basis of the PSTAT
program.  Though it remains a 16-bit function call, returning data formatted
for a 16-bit application, it is nonetheless different from the original
OS/2 1.x function in that the data structure returned is much more complete
and is easier to use.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Because this function remains a 16-bit version, the data buffer
provided to it must be allocated with the OBJ_TILED attribute and cannot
exceed 64K in size.  There are times when 64K is not enough for the entire
data structure, in which case the structure is truncated. This can lead
to memory access violations upon trying to scan the structure.  To avoid
this problem you might want to use the <A HREF="008_L1_DosQuerySysState.html">DosQuerySysState
</A>function instead.
