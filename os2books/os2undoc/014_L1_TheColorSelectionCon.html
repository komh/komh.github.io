color wheel control used by the Solid and Mixed Color Palette object is
a publicly registered window class within OS/2, but is undocumented.  The
following notes are all that is necessary to use this control class:
<P>
 (1) You must load the module WPCONFIG.DLL so that the publicly registered
window message processor (ColorSelectWndProc) can be used without an addressing
violation.
<P>
 (2) Create your control window with WinCreateWindow or through a dialog
template, using the window class name "ColorSelectClass".
<P>
 (3) If you used WinCreateWindow you will need to reposition the control
window each time the parent window is resized, as otherwise the control
will reposition itself out of view.  Dialogs seem to handle this automatically.
<P>
 (4) The only control message defined -to- the control is 0x0602 under OS/2
Warp 4 or later, or (by some reports) 0x1384 on older versions of OS/2.
Message parameter one must contain the RGB value to which the color wheel
will be set.
<P>
 (5) The only control message defined -from- the control is 0x0601 under
OS/2 Warp 4 or later, or (by some reports) 0x130C on older versions of OS/2.
Message parameter one will contain the RGB value to which the color wheel
has been set.
<P>
 (6) The control can only be sized at creation, and should be sized so that
its height is approximately 60% of its width.
