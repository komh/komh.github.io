<H1>Font Resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 132 -->
<P>
Device fonts, particularly printer fonts, usually are designed for a specific
resolution, namely the resolution of the device on which they are to be
used. By contrast, generic outline fonts are not device-specific. Generic
image fonts are designed for a particular resolution value and, therefore,
are really applicable only to devices with a matching resolution value.

<P>
The horizontal and vertical font resolution values for the device are returned
by DevQueryCaps. The desired horizontal and vertical device resolution values
in the font metrics of the font concerned are returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 FC --> GpiQueryFonts</A>.
Compare these the device and the desired resolution values only for an image
font. If they are identical then this image font is designed for use with
this device (for example, the point size in the font metrics will be accurate
for this device). To select a font, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Query the available fonts using<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 FC --> GpiQueryFonts</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you want an outline font, search the metrics
of fonts returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 39 --> GpiQueryFonts
</A>for a font that is an outline font and that has the required face name.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you want an image font, search the metrics
of the fonts returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 39 --> GpiQueryFonts
</A>for a font that is an image font and that has the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Required face name<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Required point size<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Horizontal device resolution font metric that matches
the horizontal resolution for the device<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Vertical device resolution font metric that matches
the vertical resolution for the device.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>As an alternative to the above for an image font,
search the metrics of the fonts returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 39 --> GpiQueryFonts
</A>for a font that is an image font and that has the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Required face name<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Required em height in world coordinates.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Before you define a logical font, determine the resolution of the current
device by using DevQueryCaps with the CAPS_VERTICAL_FONT_RES and CAPS_HORIZONTAL_FONT_RES
parameters.
<P>
Compare the values returned from this function with the<B> xDeviceRes</B> and
<B>yDeviceRes</B> values in the font metrics of the available fonts. These
two values contain the resolution of the device for which the font was designed.
All measurements are in pels per inch. By comparing the font resolution
with the device resolution, you can identify the image font best suited
to the current device.
