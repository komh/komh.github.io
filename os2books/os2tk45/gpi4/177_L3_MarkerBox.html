<H1>Marker Box</H1><!-- entering slot 185 -->
<P>
The<I> marker box</I> is a rectangular boundary that defines the horizontal
and vertical space occupied by the marker symbol. The marker box is used
to center the current marker symbol.
<P>
If the current marker set contains<I> vector</I> marker primitives (characters
outlined by using line and arc functions), changing the size of the marker
box changes the size of the marker primitives also. When you change the
size of the marker box, a vector marker symbol is scaled up or down automatically
to fit the box. Image marker primitives, however, cannot be scaled. If the
current marker set contains image characters, the marker box dimensions
are fixed, because you cannot alter the size of image markers.
<P>
You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 46 C4 31 --> GpiSetMarkerBox</A> to
change the size of the marker box for a particular presentation space. Set
the value of the appropriate SIZEF structure to the required size. The new
size is expressed in world coordinates and should not contain any fractional
values.
<P>
The default size of the marker box can be determined using DevQueryCaps.
The values, CAPS_MARKER_WIDTH and CAPS_MARKER_HEIGHT, depend on the currently
associated device and the presentation page. Marker box values set with
<A><!-- external link: 1D 46 C4 31 -->GpiSetMarkerBox</A> can be determined
using<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 FC --> GpiQueryMarkerBox</A>.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 2F -->GpiSetAttrs</A> also can be used to
change the size of the marker box.<A><!-- external link: 1D 35 C4 30 --> GpiSetDefAttrs
</A>can be used to change the default size of the marker box.
