<P>
Each time one of the transformation functions is called by an application,
the application can set the function's option parameter to control how the
function combines the transformation with existing transformations and in
what order the transformations are applied.

<P>
The order in which transformations are applied affects the appearance of
the picture. For example, suppose that a box primitive has been defined,
with its lower-left corner at (4,2) and its upper-right corner at (8,8),
and that you want both to scale the box by 0.5 and to translate it by (-10,-10).

<P>
If the box is translated before scaling it, the transformed box is as shown
in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="045_L3_AccumulatingTransfor_16.gif" WIDTH=421 HEIGHT=424>
<P>
Translating before Scaling
<P>
The translated box has its lower-left corner at (-6,-8), and its upper-right
corner at (-2,-2). Each of its coordinates is then scaled by 0.5, and the
transformed box has its corners at (-3,-1), (-1,-1), (-3,-4), and (-1,-4).

<P>
If the box is scaled before translating it, the transformed box is as shown
in the figure after the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="045_L3_AccumulatingTransfor_17.gif" WIDTH=421 HEIGHT=424>
<P>
Scaling before Translating
<P>
The scaled box has its lower-left corner at (2,1), and its upper-right corner
at (4,4). The box is then translated by (-10,-10), and the transformed box
has its corners at (-8,-6), (-6,-6), (-6,-9), and (-8,-9).
<P>

<P>
When an application is drawing a picture in which there are called segments,
and in which transformations are applied to the root segments, the root-segment
transformations should usually be applied to any segments they call. For
example, if a segment that is translated to the left of the picture (by
changing its segment transformation) calls a second segment, that leftward
transformation should also be applied to the called segment. In this instance,
the application would specify TRANSFORM_ADD in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C3 48 --> GpiCallSegmentMatrix
</A>to add the instance transformation to the calling segments' segment
transformation. Instance transformations are automatically reset on return
to the calling segment.
