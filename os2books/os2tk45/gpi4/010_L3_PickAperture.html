<P>
Your application determines the size of the pick aperture using<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 FC --> GpiQueryPickApertureSize</A>,
and determines the page space coordinates of the center of the aperture
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 00 C4 FC --> GpiQueryPickAperturePosition</A>.

<P>
Because your objective is to retrieve a single detectable object for each
correlation operation, you have to obtain a balance between the number of
detectable objects in a picture and the size of the pick aperture. The more
detectable objects you define, the smaller the pick aperture must be to
return a manageable amount of information to the application. However, the
pick aperture usually is not a 1 pel-by-1 pel rectangle. A larger rectangle
makes better sense because the pick aperture can be difficult to hit with
a single pel; but a larger sampling area, for example 4 pels-by-4 pels,
increases the probability of an intersection between a lighted pel and the
pick aperture.
<P>
The pick aperture can be specified in any of the units available to the
presentation space. However, the type of unit must be identical to the type
specified for the presentation page. The default size of the pick aperture
is square, with sides equal to the default character cell height.
