<H1>Font Dialog and Device Font Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
There are two types of fonts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>System fonts</I>, which can be used for both displays
and printers, and therefore, are generally more flexible.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Device fonts</I>, which are specific to a particular
device. Device fonts for printers can be built-in or be installed with font
cartridges by a user. Device fonts also can be available on diskette (also
termed<I> soft fonts</I>) and can be downloaded to the printer as required
by the printer driver.
<P>
The advantage of device fonts is that, usually, they are printed in the
highest resolution of the device and are faster than system fonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Some printer drivers, in particular, the HP LaserJet (LASERJET)
and the LaserPrinter (IBM4019) printer drivers provide an intermediate solution.
An option on the job properties dialog enables system fonts to be downloaded
to the printer as soft fonts.
<P>
As stated earlier, an application must provide the user with the ability
to choose fonts and, in particular, to choose a device font over a system
font to achieve better performance. A standard font dialog box should be
used (see WinFontDlg).
<P>
When an application uses device fonts, and the output mixes text and graphics
pictures, the device fonts are clipped per character. System fonts give
more precise clipping to the pel. The following figure illustrates the results
from clipping two lines of text:  one generated in a system font; the other,
in a device font.

Character Clipping Results for Device and System Fonts
<P>

<P>
The available device fonts can be queried, using<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 FC --> GpiQueryFonts</A>,
in either an OD_INFO or an OD_QUEUED device context. Device fonts are returned
with negative<I> lMatch</I> numbers. Then the  appropriate logical font
can be used after calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogFont</A>.

<P>
If, during the printing process, a logical font is not created, the printer
driver uses its default font for the printer, which usually is 12-point
Courier.
<P>
There are two design choices for device fonts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use system fonts for the display. When printing, query
the printer driver and attempt to choose a device font that closely matches
the system font. If no match is found, then print using the system font.
A device's font metrics and character spacing might not match exactly, so
the printed output might not be exactly the same as the display.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use a printer font if the user selects one. Determine
the metrics and find a system font that shares the same characteristics
(for example, a style such as Courier or Serifed). The character string
to be displayed is sent to the printer driver and the inter-character spacing
is returned, using<A><!-- external link: 1D C9 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCharStringPos</A>.
The individual character positions are used when the string is sent to the
display, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 55 --> GpiCharStringPos</A> with
the<I> flOptions</I> parameter of CHS_VECTOR. While the display output can
take longer to display to the screen, true<I> WYSIWYG</I> (<I>What You See
Is What You Get</I>) is achievable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
