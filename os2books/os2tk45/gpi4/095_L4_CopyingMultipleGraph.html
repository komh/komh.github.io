<P>
Your application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 47 --> GpiPutData</A> to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy elements from one segment to another<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy elements from one position in a segment to another
position in the same segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 -->GpiGetData</A> copies a buffer of
graphics orders from a named segment, into an area of application storage,
whose byte size you specify on input. Only the named segment must not be
open when you call this function. The named segment is also known as the
<I>source segment</I>.
<P>
The first time<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData</A> is called,
data retrieval has to start at the beginning of the segment. This is done
by declaring an element offset of 0.
<P>
Output from<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData</A> depends
on whether the area of application storage is large enough to hold the entire
buffer of graphics orders. If so, the buffer is returned along with a count
of the number of bytes of data returned to you from the segment. If not,
the application storage is filled, and the count is set to the size of the
application storage. The offset of the element where<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData
</A>stopped copying, and the count are returned. Your application can then
determine if a subsequent<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData
</A>needs to be called, by checking that the count is less than the size
(length) of the application storage.
<P>
On subsequent<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData</A> functions,
the element offset can be 0, or it can be the offset value that was returned
from the previous function. In this manner, if your application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData
</A>more than once to copy an entire segment, it can "pick up where it left
off", rather than recopying the segment from the beginning each time.
<P>
You can copy the data from the application storage to a new location in
a segment using<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC --> GpiPutData</A>. This
receiving segment is also known as the destination segment. The segment
into which you are copying the data can be open when you call<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC --> GpiPutData</A>.

<P>
If<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 46 --> GpiGetData</A> does not retrieve
a complete segment, the data it does retrieve can be written out to the
second segment using<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC --> GpiPutData</A>,
even if the last order copied is incomplete.
<P>
The current drawing mode determines whether the graphics orders are executed,
stored in the segment, or both. When you call<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC --> GpiPutData</A>,
the current edit mode must be SEGEM_INSERT and, if there is already data
in the destination segment, the element pointer must address the last element
of the segment.
<P>
Because the PM does not support explicit renaming of segments,<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 FC --> GpiGetData</A>-<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC -->GpiPutData
</A>is the method you use to rename a segment. That is, create a second
segment with the desired name, copy the contents of the first segment to
it, then delete the original segment.
