<H1>Font Files and Dynamic-Link Libraries</H1><!-- entering slot 125 -->
<P>
You can use the Font Editor to alter and customize image-font files. Files
created with the Font Editor have a .FNT extension. After you create a custom
font, put it into a dynamic-link library (DLL) that the application can
load. Once the application loads this library, it can use any of the custom
fonts the library contains.
<P>
DLLs that contain fonts are unique; they contain data segments and empty
(or useless) code segments. They are unique because they contain no executable
code, unlike normal DLLs. Also you are able to install the font file as
a public font if desired;<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 5F --> GpiLoadFonts
</A>will make it available only as a private font. The operating system
naming convention for a DLL that contains font information end with a .FON
extension.
<P>
To create a DLL, you must use an assembler, a linker, and the operating
system Resource Compiler. For this example, assume that your custom font
file is named NEWFONT.FNT.
<P>
After creating your custom font file, you need to create a special assembler
language file with your editor. Call this file MYFONT.ASM, for example.
The following figure shows an example of the source code for this file.

<PRE>
   code segment word      ;Makes dummy code segment aligned on word boundary
   db "empty_segment"     ;Initializes a string in dummy segment
   code ends              ;Dummy segment ends here
   end                    ;Terminates source file
</PRE>

<P>
After you have created MYFONT.ASM, assemble it by using the following command:

<PRE>    masm myfont
</PRE>

<P>
After assembling the MYFONT.ASM file, create a module-definition file. Call
this file MYFONT.DEF, for example. It should contain the statements in the
following figure.
<PRE>
    LIBRARY myfont
    SEGMENTS CODE MOVEABLE
</PRE>

<P>
The first statement tells the linker that you are creating a library with
the module name, MYFONT. The second statement tells the linker that the
segments in this library are movable code segments.
<P>
After creating MYFONT.DEF, start the linker with the command in the following
figure.
<PRE>    link myfont,,,,myfont.def
</PRE>

<P>
This command creates an empty executable file called MYFONT.EXE.
<P>
After creating the empty executable file, which is the template for a DLL,
create a resource file and call it MYFONT.RC. For example, if your font
file is called NEWFONT.FNT, you would place the statement in the following
figure in MYFONT.RC.
<PRE>    FONT    200     NEWFONT.FNT
</PRE>

<P>
This statement assigns the identifier, 200, to the font resource NEWFONT.FNT.

<P>
Finally, use the Resource Compiler to add the font file (NEWFONT.FNT) to
the empty DLL as in the following figure.
<PRE>    rc  myfont.rc
</PRE>

<P>
The executable file, MYFONT.EXE, now contains your custom fonts. After you
have renamed this file, MYFONT.FON, you can load the fonts into your application
using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 5F --> GpiLoadFonts</A> and pass it
a pointer to the path and library name as the second argument-for example,
c:\os2\dll\myfont.fon.
