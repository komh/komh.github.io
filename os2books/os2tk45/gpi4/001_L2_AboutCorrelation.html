<H1>About Correlation</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
When you want to select an area of interest on the screen, you usually move
the pointer to the applicable point and signal (by clicking a mouse, for
example) that this is the object you want. This selection process most commonly
is used for graphic applications. For example, your application could permit
a user to select an object, then change its color. Correlation, however,
can also be used in nongraphic applications. For example, your application
could model the operation of a calculator and permit a user to select numbers
for mathematical operations.
<P>
The<I> area of interest</I> is defined by the operating system as a small
rectangle, centered on the (x,y) coordinate position, that has been sent
to the application. The virtual rectangle the application generates is known
as the<I> pick aperture</I>. The following figure shows an example of a
pick aperture.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="001_L2_AboutCorrelation_0.gif" WIDTH=502 HEIGHT=399>

The Pick Aperture
<P>

<P>
The process of determining what lies in the pick aperture differs between
nonretained and retained graphics. For nonretained graphics, the presentation
space must be put in a state that supports correlation before the primitives
are drawn. Then correlation is performed while the primitives are being
drawn. For retained graphics, the segments that contain the graphics can
be replayed, permitting correlation after the primitives are drawn.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The necessity to correlate graphics can usually be predicted.
Therefore you can plan for it when designing applications. However, this
does not mean that you have to create retained (rather than nonretained)
graphic segments. The decision to retain graphics is dependent on several
considerations of which correlation is only one.
