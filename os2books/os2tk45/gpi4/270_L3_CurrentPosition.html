<H1>Current Position</H1><!-- entering slot 283 -->
<P>
The<I> current position</I> is the<I> world-coordinate space</I> position
at which the next drawing request begins. It is part of the data stored
in the presentation space. When you create or obtain a presentation space,
the current position is set to the origin (0,0). The current position also
is reset to (0,0) whenever a presentation space is associated with a different
device context.
<P>
Most drawing requests update the current position. If you draw a line from
the origin to (3,5), for example, the current position is updated to (3,5).
The current position also can be updated explicitly by<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 21 --> GpiSetCurrentPosition
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> GpiMove</A>. If you do not
want the first drawing in a presentation space to start at (0,0), call<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 21 --> GpiSetCurrentPosition
</A>first.
