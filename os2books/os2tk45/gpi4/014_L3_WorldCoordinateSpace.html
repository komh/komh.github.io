<H1>World Coordinate Space</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
The world coordinate space is where most drawing coordinates are specified.
Each primitive in a world coordinate space is defined using the coordinate
positions in the primitive's definition. For example, if an application
draws a line from (8,4) to (20,75), the coordinate values (8,4) and (20,75)
are world coordinates.
<P>
The world coordinate space is specified when the presentation space is created
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC --> GpiCreatePS</A>. The PS_FORMAT
option supports two sizes of world coordinate spaces:  short and long. If
the size is short (GPIF_SHORT), the world coordinate space is a rectangular
Cartesian space with maximum coordinates of (32767, 32767) and minimum coordinates
of (-32768, -32768). If the world coordinate space is short, it is the application's
responsibility to ensure that the coordinates defining the subpicture fall
within this range.
<P>
The second size, long (GPIF_LONG), is the default for the world coordinate
space. Most GPI functions that direct their output to the world coordinate
space, for example<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 FC --> GpiLine</A>, accept
32-bit integers as parameters. A 32-bit integer is equivalent to a rectangular
Cartesian space with maximum coordinates of (134217727, 134217727) and minimum
coordinates of (-134217728, -134217728).
<P>
World coordinates do not have to be within the range of the presentation
page. A graphic image that requires a high degree of detail and precision
might use most or all of the available coordinate range. A transformation
is used to scale the graphic image down to an appropriate size. The actual
presentation page size is unimportant in most cases. It is used with the
page viewport to redefine the device transform if<A><!-- external link: 1D 4B C4 53 --> GpiSetPageViewport
</A>is called.
<P>
An application can use a<I> clip path</I> clipping area to define the part
of the world space to place in the next coordinate space (the model space).
A clip path is the only clipping region that can be nonrectangular. Its
edges can include arcs, curves, and straight lines. The coordinates that
define the dimensions and shape of a clip path are always world coordinates.
(Clipping is further described in<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C5 2B --> Clipping
and Boundary Determination</A>.)
<P>
In a world-coordinate space, there can be several graphic primitives. If,
however, an application uses the DM_RETAIN drawing mode to store output
in graphic segments, the operating system assigns a new world space to each
segment. There is also a world space for the drawings outside of segments.
