<H1>Network Printing Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 267 -->
<P>
The architecture of PM requires a printer driver during the print job creation
process to deal with queries, such as DevQueryHardcopyCaps, and to provide
the job properties dialog by way of DevPostDeviceModes. To do any printing
across a network, a locally installed printer driver is required. In some
cases, such as when the network server does not run PM, this is an advantage,
in that all the conversion to printer-specific commands can be done on the
requestor.
<P>
The printer object in the workplace provides seamless access to network
printers; the user need only install the appropriate printer driver.
<P>
The application programmer also is helped. A network printer that is accessed
by the user has a hidden shadow on the requestor. The job properties for
the shadow printer object can be altered and are stored on the requestor.
This enables the user to configure one or more variations on the original
configuration without requiring intervention from a system administrator
to create many network printer objects, each with a slightly different default
job property configuration.
<P>
The shadow printer object is created on the requestor by creating a local
queue and local device with no port connection. The application can enumerate
these queues using SplEnumQueue, as before. The only difference is in the
PRQINFO6 structure; there are two extra fields not in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C4 76 --> PRQINFO3
</A>structure. These two extra fields, named<I> pszRemoteComputerName</I> and
<I>pszRemoteQueueName</I> contain the name of the remote server and the
remote queue. The spooler uses these fields to automatically reroute print
data, submitted by an application to the local shadow, to the appropriate
network queue.
<P>
The printer object creates a local shadow only when the network printer
object has been used or modified, because there could be a large number
of network printer objects, and the spooler does not know which one the
user wants to use. The local shadow of a network printer object is created
in the following cases:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When a file is dragged and dropped on the network
printer object<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the network printer object is moved, copied,
or shadowed outside its original server folder<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the printer or job properties are modified<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
