<P>
The visibility attribute controls whether a segment is to be visible on
an output device. The contents of a segment that is not defined with the
visibility attribute set ON are still executed whenever the segment is drawn.
This can cause changes to the current position and to current attribute
values, even though the primitives themselves are not visible on the output
device. The visibility attribute is set ON by default.
