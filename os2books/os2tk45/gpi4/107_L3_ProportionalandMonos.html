<P>
When text is drawn, the operating system aligns each character by positioning
its character cell next to that of the previous character.
<P>
A<I> monospace</I> font provides the same amount of space for each character,
whatever its shape. These fonts also are called<I> fixed fonts</I>. Courier
and System Monospaced are monospace fonts. Monospace fonts, in fact, are
essential for some purposes- for example program listings, where vertical
alignment is important.
<P>
A<I> proportionally-spaced</I> font is one in which some characters are
allotted less space than others, so that each character occupies the proportion
of space that is correct for its shape. For example, a lowercase letter
<I>l</I> does not need the same space as a lowercase letter<I> m</I>. Many
graphics fonts supplied by the PM, including the system font, support proportional
spacing.
<P>
The font metrics value<B> maxcharinc</B> specifies the width of the widest
character in the font, and the value<B> avecharwidth</B> specifies an average
width of the characters in the font.
<P>
You can retrieve information about the widths of the characters in the current
font by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 12 C4 FC --> GpiQueryWidthTable</A>.
You provide the code point of the first character you are interested in
and the number of characters for which you want width-table information.
