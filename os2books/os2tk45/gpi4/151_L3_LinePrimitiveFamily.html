<P>
When the operating system draws a line, it includes the pels at the starting
and ending points of the line. The algorithm used to draw the rest of the
line depends on the device driver. For example, a driver for a raster device
might use a modified Bresenham algorithm to draw a line, but a driver for
a vector device, such as a plotter, simply would connect the starting and
ending points of the line. In all cases, the result is a line primitive
that looks the same from device to device.
