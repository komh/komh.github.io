<H1>Storing Pictures in a Metafile</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
When a metafile device context is associated with a presentation space,
presentation space resources (such as the current logical color table) and
environmental settings (such as the presentation-page format) are copied
automatically into the metafile. These items must be established<I> before
</I>the presentation space is associated with the metafile device context.

<P>
Loading of additional resources (such as fonts) and adjustments to the environment
(such as modifying the default viewing transform) should be made before
you begin drawing. Attribute settings, segment-creation requests, and primitive-drawing
requests that contribute to the picture are directed to the metafile<I> after
</I>its device context has been associated with a presentation space.
<P>
If an application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 39 C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawControl</A>,
specifying DCTL_DISPLAY and DCTL_OFF, before drawing graphics into a metafile,
the graphics are not visible when the metafile is played. However, the metafile
records any changes made to the current position or presentation-space attributes.

<P>
When the metafile device context has been associated with a graphics presentation
space, the metafile is ready to receive graphical data. Just as with any
other output destination, whether the picture is sent directly to the metafile
is controlled by the current drawing mode, as shown in the following table.

<P>
The drawing mode can be changed at any time while the metafile device context
remains open by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 3A C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawingMode</A>.

<P>
As long as the metafile device context remains open, you can continue drawing.
A metafile can only contain data generated from GPI functions. Any nongraphical
data included in a metafile is ignored. The following list describes items
found in a metafile:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Picture<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Logical color table<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Logical font<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Fill pattern<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Viewing transformation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Page units<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Page dimensions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
When an application finishes drawing in a metafile, it must disassociate
the metafile device context from the presentation space by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 FC --> GpiAssociate</A>.
If the metafile is associated with or through a micro presentation space,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C3 68 --> GpiDestroyPS</A> to perform an
implicit disassociation.
<P>
When you have finished drawing in the metafile, and the presentation space
has been disassociated, the application can close the metafile device context
and obtain a handle to the metafile by calling DevCloseDC. A closed metafile
cannot be reopened; therefore, additional drawing in the metafile is not
possible. A closed metafile can be referenced by the<I> metafile handle</I>.
The metafile handle is used to reference the metafile for subsequent operations
on the metafile. Use the metafile handle to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Transfer a metafile to application memory<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Transfer
a metafile from application memory<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Save a metafile on disk<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Play a metafile into presentation space<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Edit a metafile<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Copy a metafile<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Delete a metafile<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Because each metafile can be distinctly identified, your application can
work with more than one metafile at a time. However, because metafiles can
be very large files, you must make maximum use of the metafile handles to
<!-- entering slot 209 -->avoid duplicating the actual metafiles in memory.
