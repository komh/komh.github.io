<H1>Creating Regions</H1><!-- entering slot 329 -->
<P>
To create a rectangular region, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>.
This function accepts, as input, the number of rectangles to be ORed into
a single region and the coordinates of those rectangles. If the number of
rectangles is 0, an empty region is created.
<P>
To create a new region from regions that already exist, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> GpiCombineRegion</A>.
This function accepts, as input, a region handle for the target region,
a region handle for each of the two source regions, and an options flag
that specifies the way the two source regions are combined.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The destination region can be either of the two source regions,
in which case, that region is replaced by the new region.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
The rectangles are differentiated by one region's being distinctly "the
first source rectangle" and the other region labeled "the second source
rectangle". The order of the source rectangles affects the way<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 4D --> GpiCombineRegion
</A>combines them. You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 4D --> GpiCombineRegion
</A>an indefinite number of times to form complex polygons. However, the
function is limited to combining only two regions each time it is called.
The two source regions must be created for the same type of device.
<P>
Following are the five ways in which two regions can be combined:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Option<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Result<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CRGN_OR<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Union
of the two source regions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CRGN_XOR<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Symmetric
difference of the two source regions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CRGN_COPY<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Source
region 1 only; source region 2 is ignored<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CRGN_AND
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Intersection of the two source regions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CRGN_DIFF
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Source region 1 minus source region 2<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The effects of these different combining operations on overlapping regions
are shown in The effects of these different combining operations on overlapping
regions are shown in the following figure. Their effects on separate regions
are shown in Their effects on separate regions are shown in the figure after
the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_CreatingRegions_78.gif" WIDTH=621 HEIGHT=666>
<P>
Combining Overlapping Regions
<P>
The source regions are two overlapping rectangles. The regions that result
from the various combine operations are shown as shaded areas.
<P>

<P>
Output from<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 4D --> GpiCombineRegion</A> tells
you whether the resulting region is a NULL region, rectangular region, or
complex region. A<I> complex region</I> is any region defined by two or
more rectangles.
<P>
To change the definition of a region while keeping the same region handle,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 54 C4 FC --> GpiSetRegion</A>. This function
accepts, as input, the number and dimensions of the rectangles that now
define the region, just as<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 4E --> GpiCreateRegion
</A>does. However,<A><!-- external link: 1D 54 C4 4F --> GpiSetRegion</A> also
accepts the handle of the region to be updated.<A><!-- external link: 1D 54 C4 FC --> GpiSetRegion</A>,
like<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>, takes a
region definition to be the union of a sequence of rectangles (that are
effectively ORed together). In the case of<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>,
a new region is created and its handle returned. In the case of<A><!-- external link: 1D 54 C4 FC --> GpiSetRegion</A>,
the previous definition is discarded and replaced by the new definition
that is associated with the existing region handle.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_CreatingRegions_79.gif" WIDTH=589 HEIGHT=398>
<P>
Combining Disjoint Regions
<P>
The two source regions do not overlap. The regions that result from the
various combine operations are shown as shaded areas. The result from a
CRGN_AND combining of separate regions is a NULL region.
