<H1>Path Conversion to Clip Path</H1><!-- entering slot 316 -->
<P>
<I>Clipping</I> is the process an application uses to limit graphics output
to a specific area (called the<I> clipping area</I>) of the display or page.

<P>
There are several clipping functions provided by the PM. However, if your
application requires an irregular complex shape for a clipping area, it
must define the shape with a path. To convert the path into a clipping boundary,
use<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 FC --> GpiSetClipPath</A>. The clip path,
as defined by this operation, becomes the current clip path for all subsequent
drawing.
<P>
This function accepts a path identifier and one of two construction options
as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SCP_ALTERNATE (default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SCP_WINDING (must be selected if the path has been
modified)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Unlike the path operations described previously,<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 42 --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>accepts two different path identifiers:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><LI>default).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The default path identifier of 0 (SCP_RESET) resets the clip path to infinity,
which displays the picture without clipping. If this value is selected,
the current clip path definition is discarded instead of stored.
<P>
For<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 FC --> GpiSetClipPath</A>, a path identifier
of 1 (SCP_AND) causes the clip path to be redefined as the mathematical
intersection of the stored clip path and the current path definition. For
all other path operations, an identifier of 1 specifies the current path
as the recipient of the operation. The only method of specifying the clip
path as the current path, after<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 42 --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>has been called, is to call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 42 --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>again: the first call with a path identifier of 0; the second, with
a path identifier of 1. The path identifiers and the construction mode can
be ORed together for certain effects.
<P>
Any open figures within a path are closed automatically. The boundaries
of the path are considered part of the interior, so any point on the boundary
is not clipped. The following figure shows the result of clipping text with
a triangular clip path.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="303_L3_PathConversiontoClip_76.gif" WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=180> Triangular
