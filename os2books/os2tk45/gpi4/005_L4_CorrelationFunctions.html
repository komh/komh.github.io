<H1>Correlation Functions for Retained Graphics</H1><!-- entering slot 5 -->
<P>
The PM has three different functions that enable you to correlate a uniquely
identified retained segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Function<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C3 2F --> GpiCorrelateSegment
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Permits correlation on a single segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 2E --> GpiCorrelateFrom
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Permits correlation on a range of segments
from a segment chain.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 70 C3 2D --> GpiCorrelateChain
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Permits correlation on the entire segment chain.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For nonretained graphics, the correlation hits are returned by the actual
drawing commands. For retained graphics, the correlation hits are returned
by the three correlation functions listed above.

The size of the pick aperture is set using<A><!-- external link: 1D 52 C4 FC --> GpiSetPickApertureSize</A>,
just as with nonretained graphics. However, the coordinate position on which
the pick aperture is centered usually is obtained from operator input, for
example, from a WM_BUTTON1DOWN message, instead of from<A><!-- external link: 1D 51 C4 FC --> GpiSetPickAperturePosition</A>.

<P>
After the graphics orders that create pictures are stored in retained segments,
the pictures can be re-created by your application with the various GpiDraw...
functions. Then the user can view the pictures, if the output is directed
to a screen for example. After the user selects an area of interest, a GpiCorrelate...
function redraws the picture internally to determine just what intersects
the pick aperture. The user does not see the re-creation. A standard order
of functions within your application would be:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiDraw...<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 52 C4 FC -->GpiSetPickApertureSize
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>GpiCorrelate...<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
