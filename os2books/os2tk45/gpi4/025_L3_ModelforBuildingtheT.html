<H1>Model for Building the Transformation Matrix</H1><!-- entering slot 26 -->
<P>
The transformation matrix shown above can be set equal to an entity as complex
as:
<P>
<I>M*I*S*V*D</I>
<P>
where * symbolizes matrix multiplication. As mentioned earlier, all the
transformation types might not have a distinct value at all times. One,
or all, could simply be the identity transformation.
<P>
These intermediate space and step-wise transformations are not actually
how the operating system performs transformations. The reason for this relates
to the way the PM stores transformation information. The transformation
matrix data structure<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 FC --> MATRIXLF</A>,
undergoes continuous modification during the drawing process, and it can
be influenced by more than one transformation function from the application
responding, for example, to what a user wants the drawing to look like.

<P>
For example, after creating the model of a building from drawing primitives,
the user might want to see two identical buildings side-by-side. The application
has already applied a series of transformations to the two segments in world
coordinate space to create the model of the building. If the application,
rather than the PM, had to perform the entire transformation over again
from start to finish, it would have to keep track of much more detail. The
PM enables applications to process a smaller portion of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 46 --> MATRIXLF
</A>structure, in this example the "V" or "V and D" component, to enable
the user to see two buildings side-by-side.
