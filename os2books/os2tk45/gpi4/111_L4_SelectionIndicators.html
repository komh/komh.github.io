<H1>Selection Indicators</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
There are five selection indicators:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Indicator<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> If set ON, selects...<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FATTR_SEL_ITALIC
<!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL>A font with an italic appearance. This is intended
for use with an image font and results in a simulation of an italic font.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FATTR_SEL_BOLD<!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> A boldface
version of the font. This is intended for use with an image font and results
in a simulation of a boldface font.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FATTR_SEL_OUTLINE
<!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL>Hollow characters when using an outline font. This
only can be used with outline fonts.
<P>
This indicator is less important than the others because improved performance
is now available (from Adobe Type Manager) on filled outline fonts than
was originally available when this option (FATTR_SEL_OUTLINE) was introduced.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FATTR_SEL_STRIKEOUT<!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> A font
in which the characters are struck through. This option also might be selected
on the character string primitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FATTR_SEL_UNDERSCORE
<!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL>A font in which the characters are underscored.
This option also might be selected on the character string primitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any combination of these indicators can be set. When set, they cause a simulation
of the selected feature. For example, if you require a bold, italicized
version of a PM image font, PM simulates that feature because bold, italic
image fonts are not supplied.
