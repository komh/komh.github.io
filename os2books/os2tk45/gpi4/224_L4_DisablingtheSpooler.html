<P>
The workplace user interface to control the spooler can be found in the
System Setup folder. For special circumstances or applications, the spooler
object can be used to disable the spooler. Generally, this is not recommended
because the output from two applications can intermix, or one application
can be paused until the first application has finished sending data to the
printer.
