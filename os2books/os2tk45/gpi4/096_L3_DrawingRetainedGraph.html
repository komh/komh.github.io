<H1>Drawing Retained Graphics</H1><!-- entering slot 97 -->
<P>
Nonretained graphics segments and primitives outside of graphics segment
are always drawn immediately to the current output device. Segments that
have been retained in segment store, however, can be drawn any number of
times to any number of device contexts. The PM has three different functions
that allow you to draw segments:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Function<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C3 53 --> GpiDrawSegment
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Draws a single segment in the chain<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 --> GpiDrawFrom
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Draws a group of segments in the chain<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 51 --> GpiDrawChain
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Draws the entire chain<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C3 53 -->GpiDrawSegment</A> draws a single,
named segment, which can be chained or unchained. You supply the segment
name as input to this function.<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C3 53 --> GpiDrawSegment
</A>can draw a dynamic segment in some circumstances. These are described
in <A HREF="097_L3_DrawingDynamicSegmen.html">Drawing Dynamic Segments</A>.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 -->GpiDrawFrom</A> draws one or more
root segments from the segment chain. You supply the names of two root segments
as input. The drawing process starts at the first named segment and draws
all chained and called segments, excluding dynamic segments, up to and including
the second named segment.
<P>
The order in which you specify the segment names is to reflect their relative
positions in the segment chain. If the second-named segment appears in the
segment chain before the first-named segment, no error is raised, but drawing
starts from the first named segment and continues to the end of the chain.
This also happens if the second segment is an unchained segment rather than
a root segment. If the drawing control, DCTL_DYNAMIC is set, any dynamic
segments already drawn on the display are removed before<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 --> GpiDrawFrom
</A>begins to draw nondynamic segments. Then they are redrawn after<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 --> GpiDrawFrom
</A>ends.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 51 -->GpiDrawChain</A> draws all nondynamic
chained segments in a named presentation space, as well as any unchained
segments called by those chained segments. It does not draw dynamic segments.
You supply only the presentation space handle as input to this function.
If the drawing control, DCTL_DYNAMIC is set, any dynamic segments already
drawn on the display are removed before<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 --> GpiDrawFrom
</A>begins to draw nondynamic segments. Then they are redrawn after<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 52 --> GpiDrawFrom
</A>completes.
<P>
You can call any of these functions while a segment is open. The open segment
is not modified by these functions, although any of them can result in the
current attribute values and current position being modified. For more information
about the attribute-resetting process, see <A HREF="144_L1_GraphicsAttributes.html">Graphics
Attributes</A>.
<P>
The current drawing mode determines whether the segments identified in the
drawing functions are executed, stored in the segment, or both. The current
drawing mode does not affect which segments are drawn, or the priority in
which they are drawn for any of these three GPI drawing functions.
<P>
If an error occurs during the drawing process, you can determine where the
error occurred using<A><!-- external link: 1D 8F C3 FC --> GpiErrorSegmentData</A>.
This function returns information about the last error that occurred during
a segment-drawing operation. It returns a pointer to the segment identifier
and a pointer to one of three constants that indicate when the error occurred.
