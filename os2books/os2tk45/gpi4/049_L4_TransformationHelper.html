<H1>Transformation Helper Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 50 -->
<P>
Three helper functions, are provided to perform the matrix math required
to concatenate transformations:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C4 FC -->GpiTranslate
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 19 C4 FC -->GpiRotate</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 1C C4 FC -->GpiScale</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any of these three functions can be used with the TRANSFORM_ADD option to
concatenate the new matrix with an existing matrix. This method builds up
the matrix in application storage in a sequence of steps before using a
single transform function.
<P>
While this is slower than hard coding the matrix, it is faster than alternating
between applying transformation operations directly to the matrix then applying
a transformation function.
<P>
The helper functions merely calculate the appropriate matrix. The transformation
is not applied until the array containing the matrix values is passed to
the appropriate transformation function.
<P>
Applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C4 35 --> GpiTranslate</A> to
change the position of an object. The application specifies the coordinates
of the point to which to move the object and the name of the transform matrix
to use as input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C4 FC --> GpiTranslate</A>.
The transformation matrix must be in the form of a one-dimensional array.
The application also can specify whether this transformation is to replace
the value for a previous transformation, or whether it is to be added to
it.
<P>
Applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D 19 C4 33 --> GpiRotate</A> to
rotate an object. The application specifies the angle of rotation, the coordinates
of the point around which the object is to rotate, and the transformation
matrix. The transformation matrix must be in the form of a one-dimensional
array. The application also can specify whether this transformation is to
replace the value for a previous transformation, or whether it is to be
added to it.
<P>
To scale an object at a point without also moving the object, applications
use<A><!-- external link: 1D 1C C4 FC --> GpiScale</A>. When using<A><!-- external link: 1D 1C C4 FC --> GpiScale</A>,
the application specifies the scaling factor, the coordinates of the center
point, and the transformation matrix. The transformation matrix must be
in the form of a one-dimensional array. The application also can specify
whether this transformation is to replace the value for a previous transformation,
or whether it is to be added to it.
<P>
An application could alternate between applying transformation operations
directly to the transformation matrix, then applying a transformation function
with the TRANSFORM_ADD option set. This would build up the matrix in the
presentation space. This method has the slowest performance of the concatenation
methods.
