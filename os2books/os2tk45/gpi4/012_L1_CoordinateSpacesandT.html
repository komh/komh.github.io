<H1>Coordinate Spaces and Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
A<I> transformation</I> is an operation performed on a graphics object that
changes the object in one of four ways:  translation, rotation, scaling
and shearing. Transformations enable an application to control the location,
orientation, size, and shape of graphics output on any output device.
<P>
The transformation of graphics output can be conceptually divided into a
series of distinct transformations applied from one logical stopping point
to another. Coordinate spaces are used as a method of conceptualizing these
logical stopping points. The coordinate spaces are concepts used to explain
and manipulate the transformation process.
<P>
A graphics primitive in an intermediate coordinate space cannot be displayed
on an output device and a transformation cannot be interrupted at one of
the distinct stages. The entire series of transformation steps is applied
all at once.
