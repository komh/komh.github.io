<P>
When an application data file is dropped on a printer object, the application
can receive a DM_PRINTOBJECT message if the application is running currently.

<P>
One DM_PRINTOBJECT parameter gives a DRAGITEM structure that describes the
object that was dropped. The other parameter gives a PRINTDEST structure
that contains all the parameters required to call DevPostDeviceModes and
DevOpenDC.
<P>
The PD_JOB_PROPERTY flag indicates to the application that the user has
requested a job properties dialog before printing. If this flag is not set,
the application must not display the job properties dialog; it must use
the job properties passed in the PRINTDEST structure.
<P>
The rest of the printing process follows the procedure described in <A HREF="235_L3_SubmittingaQueuedPre.html">Submitting
a Queued Presentation Manager Print Job</A>.
