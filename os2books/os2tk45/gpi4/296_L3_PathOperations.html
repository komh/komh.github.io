<H1>Path Operations</H1><!-- entering slot 309 -->
<P>
The operations performed on a path determine which of the path attributes
become applicable. Unlike specifying area brackets, the variety of operations
also calls for separate functions instead of specifying options with<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC --> GpiBeginPath</A>.
Specifically, the following six operations can be performed on a path:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Outline<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Fill<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Modify<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Stroke<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Convert to clip path<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Convert to region<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are other graphics operations provided by the PM -for example, transformations-
that can apply to entities other than paths.
<P>
Upon completion,<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> GpiFillPath</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC -->GpiOutlinePath</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 FC --> GpiStrokePath</A>,
and<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C3 35 --> GpiPathToRegion</A> delete the
current path definition. This path is not available for any subsequent operations.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 33 -->GpiModifyPath</A> does not delete
the current path definition. An application can modify a path before using
one of the aforementioned functions.
<P>
The first time your application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 FC --> GpiSetClipPath</A>,
the current path definition is converted into the current clip path.<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 36 --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>deletes the path definition upon completion but not the clip path definition.

<P>
A path definition can be stored in a graphics segment and, if that segment
is retained, the path can be re-created as required. Segments are discussed
in<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C5 21 --> Creating and Drawing Retained Graphics</A>.
