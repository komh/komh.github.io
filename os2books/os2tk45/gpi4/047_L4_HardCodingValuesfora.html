<H1>Hard Coding Values for a Concatenated Matrix</H1><!-- entering slot 48 -->
<P>
Pre-calculating the concatenated matrix values, then hard coding the values
into the application, gives the fastest performance. However, this is rarely
practical as the actual transformations to be performed are often variable.

<P>
If an application is, for example, performing interactive graphics, and
one of the options offered to the user is a menu choice of rotate by 90Â°,
and enlarge by 4, then the rotational and scaling factors would not change,
and the matrix values could be hard coded into the application.
<P>
