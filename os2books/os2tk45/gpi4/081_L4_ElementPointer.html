<H1>Element Pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
Use the<I> element pointer</I> to change the contents of an existing segment.
When calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 FC --> GpiOpenSegment</A>, the
element pointer is set to 0. The first element that you add to a newly created
segment causes the pointer to be set to 1, and each subsequent element causes
the pointer to be incremented by 1. When a segment is closed, the element
pointer is always reset to 0.
<P>
Your application can move the element pointer to a specified value using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 3C C4 FC -->GpiSetElementPointer</A>. For example,
to address the sixth element in a segment, set the element pointer to 6.

<P>
Your application also can move the element pointer by a specific number,
rather than to a specific number, using<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> GpiOffsetElementPointer</A>.
For example, if the element pointer currently addresses element 3, to move
it to element 8, code an offset of 5 in<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> GpiOffsetElementPointer</A>.
The pointer moves backward rather than forward through the segment. The
offset value can be a positive or negative number.
<P>
If the sum of the offset and the current pointer position is less than 0,
the operating system sets the pointer so that it points to position 0. Position
0 precedes the first element in the segment. If the sum of the offset and
the current pointer position is greater than the number of elements in the
segment, the operating system sets the pointer so that it points to the
last element in the segment.
<P>
You can determine the current location of the element pointer using<A><!-- external link: 1D DE C3 FC --> GpiQueryElementPointer</A>.
To request the contents of a part of or all of the elements at the current
pointer position, use GpiQueryElement.
