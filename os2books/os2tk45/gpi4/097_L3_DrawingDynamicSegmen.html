<H1>Drawing Dynamic Segments</H1><!-- entering slot 98 -->
<P>
A<I> dynamic segment</I> is a chained segment that possesses special properties.
Dynamic segments are those that can be moved or changed in some other way
without disturbing the remaining parts of the picture. To draw dynamic segments
on the display screen for the first time, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 FC --> GpiDrawDynamics</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 32 -->GpiDrawDynamics</A> draws every dynamic
segment in the segment chain.
<P>
When they have been drawn on the display, dynamic segments can be updated.
For example, to move one or more dynamic segments to another part of the
display screen, remove them from their current position using<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 C4 FC --> GpiRemoveDynamics</A>.
You can restrict the scope of this function by supplying the names of a
start segment and a finish segment. The start segment and finish segment
can be the same. Dynamic segments outside of this range are not removed
from the display screen.
<P>
If you intend to re-associate the presentation space, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 C4 33 --> GpiRemoveDynamics
</A>first; otherwise,<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 C4 33 --> GpiRemoveDynamics
</A>cannot remove the dynamic segments after the presentation space has
been re-associated. The dynamic segments effectively cease to be dynamic.

<P>
After removing the appropriate dynamic segments from the display screen,
you can redraw them elsewhere, again using<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 FC --> GpiDrawDynamics</A>.
If you specify a range of dynamic segments in<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 C4 FC --> GpiRemoveDynamics</A>,
the redrawing is restricted to that range. Note that, when dynamic segments
have been drawn on the display screen, you must not edit their definitions
in segment store.
<P>
Dynamic segments are treated like nondynamic segments when you are directing
output to a hardcopy device.<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 C4 33 --> GpiRemoveDynamics
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 32 --> GpiDrawDynamics</A> raise
an error condition if the current output device is not a display window.

<P>
