<P>
The media space is used only with windows. When an application draws a primitive
at a specified location in a window, it is not actually drawing in the device
space, as the device is the entire terminal screen.
<P>
Drawing in a window involves a shifting transformation which moves a drawing
from the given (unitless) position, to position in the specified window.
