<H1>Print Job Formats</H1><!-- entering slot 233 -->
<P>
The print jobs held in a spooler queue are known as<I> spool files</I>.
Spool files contain the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Parameters submitted with the print job<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Print job data<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Print job data is in one of two formats:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>PM_Q_STD</B>
<P>
Standard output data, PM_Q_STD is spooled as a PM metafile; that is, as
a series of graphics orders stored in a packed binary format. PM_Q_STD print
jobs are created through the GPI.
<P>
An advantage of the PM_Q_STD format is that the files are smaller than PM_Q_RAW
format files. The smaller size saves disk space for jobs in the spooler
queue and reduces network traffic when transmitting the data to a network
server.
<P>
The content of PM_Q_STD jobs can be viewed using the PICVIEW application.
This is achieved using the job-content menu on a print job in the printer
object. The multi-page spool file can be shown in a device-independent manner
so that the content of the job can be recognized easily.
<P>
After a job is spooled and ready to print, the spooler sends the PM_Q_STD
job to the queue driver. The queue driver replays the metafile, through
the GPI, to the appropriate printer driver. The driver, in turn, converts
the data to printer-specific commands, that is, a printer-specific format.

<P>
There are some restrictions on the content of PM_Q_STD jobs that are related
to the restrictions for PM metafiles. PM applications that cannot deal with
these restrictions should enqueue print jobs using PM_Q_RAW, but there is
an increase in required disk space and, possibly, network traffic.
<P>
Print jobs sent to network servers that do not support PM are converted
automatically to the PM_Q_RAW format by the system. The application still
can continue specifying PM_Q_STD.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The effect of converting all PM_Q_STD print jobs to PM_Q_RAW
can be turned on by the user's selecting<B> Printer-specific format</B> in
a printer object settings page.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>PM_Q_RAW</B>
<P>
Raw data, PM_Q_RAW, is the actual printer command to print the job. For
example, raw data created for an HP** LaserJet** printer contains Printer
Command Language (PCL) commands; and raw data created for a PostScript**
printer contains PostScript commands.
<P>
The content of PM_Q_RAW jobs can be viewed with the system editor. This
is achieved using the job content menu on a print job in the printer object.
However, it is not always easy to recognize the content of a job. For example,
PostScript is very hard to understand and get a visual idea of the actual
output.
<P>
Print jobs are created by the file system as a result of printing directly
to the physical port using either INT 17 or INT 21 under DOS or the OS/2
DosOpen API. These print jobs always are queued using PM_Q_RAW. The actual
queue chosen depends on the port used and the configuration of the print
subsystem.
<P>
PM applications also can use the PM_Q_RAW format, but the overall print-job
creation process normally is slower because the printer driver has to perform
more work to create the printer-specific format.
<P>
If the<B> Print while spooling</B> printer object setting is turned on,
the user can perceive a faster response. In particular for a multi-page
document, the first page starts printing as soon as the printer driver has
completely finished converting the GPI to the printer-specific format.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> PM applications always should specify the PM_Q_STD format.
The difference in disk space used can be from a factor of 2 to a factor
of 50. The<B> Printer-specific format</B> and<B> Print while spooling</B> printer
object settings can be used to configure optimal performance for the environment.

<P>
Although the base operating system supports the two print job formats described
above, other formats can be supported by providing an appropriate queue
driver.
