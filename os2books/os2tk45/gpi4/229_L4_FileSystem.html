<H1>File System</H1><!-- entering slot 239 -->
<P>
The file system is involved in both the spooling process and the printing
process. When non-PM applications create print data, the file system intercepts
the data and places it on a spooler queue. After a printer driver has processed
a print job, the file system sends the data to the appropriate file or device
using a kernel device driver.
