<H1>About Metafiles</H1><!-- entering slot 196 -->
<P>
Metafiles can exist in three distinct forms. A metafile that has just been
created is called a<I> memory metafile</I> because it exists in memory managed
by the Presentation Manager on behalf of the application that created it.
A metafile that is transferred to disk storage as a file with the default
extension of .MET is called a<I> disk metafile</I>. A metafile that is loaded
into an application's memory is<I> editable</I> by the application.
<P>
Metafiles save resources in the following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Metafiles can be created and used in draw mode by
a single application.  Therefore, an application that is not retaining segments
in a segment store can retain graphics in a metafile.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Metafiles remain available while the owning application
is running, regardless of the number of presentation spaces the application
obtains or defines.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Given the same starting conditions in each presentation
space, you can produce an identical picture each time the metafile contents
are executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Different threads or processes within an application
can display a picture stored as a metafile without each having to own the
metafile.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If your organization has common graphical resources,
such as a company logo, those resources can be stored in a metafile. This
avoids the overhead of re-creating the resources each time they are needed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Because the metafile is a device-independent format,
it is useful for transferring pictures that are to be printed when the printer-type
is unknown.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->PM applications can exchange graphical information
by using metafiles, either by using the clipboard or by transferring them
over a network.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your application can also exchange graphics data with
non-PM applications that support the Mixed Object Document Content Architecture
(MO:DCA) interchange standard.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Unlike bit-maps, metafiles offer some device-independence. Bit maps store
picture information on a pel-by-pel basis. Metafiles store picture information
in the form of low-level graphics commands that the operating system uses
to construct the pictures.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Metafiles can contain bit maps or other graphics information
that is in device-dependent format.
<P>
The graphics commands, called "graphics orders", represent graphics functions
that create a picture. These include drawing instructions, as well as attribute-setting
instructions (for example, color tables and logical fonts) and anything
that describes the structure of the picture. The contents of a metafile,
therefore, are similar to those of the graphics presentation space in which
the picture is drawn. The Presentation Manager automatically records the
environmental detail of the presentation space in which a picture is drawn
in the metafile.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A metafile can contain data generated from GPI functions only.
Any non-graphical data included in a metafile is ignored.
<P>
An application can re-create a picture from a metafile and display it in
a window on the screen or print it by "playing" the metafile. When an application
displays the contents of a metafile, it can use the color table, font, fill
pattern, and transformations that are stored in the metafile, or it can
use the logical color table, logical font, fill pattern, and transformations
that are set for the current presentation space. The appearance of the picture
stored in the metafile can, therefore, be changed by editing the current
presentation space before playing the metafile.
<P>
An application can save metafiles to a disk to be loaded later by any application
that chooses to access the metafile. Disk metafiles loaded into application
memory can also be edited in the same manner as elements in graphics segments
are edited.
<P>
They contain<!-- entering slot 197 --> both primitives and attributes.
