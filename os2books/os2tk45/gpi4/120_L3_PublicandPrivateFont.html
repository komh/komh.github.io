<P>
The fonts supplied by PM are loaded automatically when the system is started
and are available to any application at any time. They are said to be<I> public
fonts</I>. Any font that you define locally has to be loaded before you
can use it. If you load a locally defined font using the<B> Install</B> option
of the Workplace Font Palette, that font is available to any application
in the system, and, therefore is a public font. Some devices provide their
own fonts. All device fonts are public fonts.
<P>
Any font loaded using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 2C --> GpiLoadFonts
</A>from within an application is a<I> private font</I>. A private font
is available only to the application that loads it. The file in which you
store a locally created font definition can contain more than one font definition.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 2C -->GpiLoadFonts</A> loads a named font
file and, therefore, loads all fonts defined in that file.<A><!-- external link: 1D E2 C3 2D --> GpiQueryFontFileDescriptions
</A>provides the family name and the face name of each font in a locally
defined font file. Use this function to determine if a particular file contains
the font you want to use before you load it.
<P>
To unload a previously loaded private font file, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C4 FC --> GpiUnloadFonts</A>.
You cannot unload public fonts with this function.
<P>
You cannot use private fonts in a document that you want to print using
the spooler. If you want to print the document from a printer server, using
the PM_Q_STD format, all the fonts used in the document must be installed
as public fonts on the server. You can use either public or private fonts
if you specify the data format PM_Q_RAW or if you want to print without
the spooler.
