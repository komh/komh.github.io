<H1>Changing the Attributes of a Segment</H1><!-- entering slot 91 -->
<P>
After you create a segment, you might need to alter its attributes. For
example, if you created a segment using the default attributes and you want
to perform a correlation operation on the subpicture in that segment, you
will need to set the detectable attribute using<A><!-- external link: 1D 55 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentAttrs</A>.
You can retrieve the values of the attributes for any segment using<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 FC --> GpiQuerySegmentAttrs</A>.

<P>
You can change the default segment-attribute settings globally for a single
presentation space using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3F C4 FC --> GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>.
The attribute setting that you specify in this function applies to all segments
created subsequently in that presentation space, except that a nonretained
segment can never have the dynamic attribute. For example, if you want all
segments to be detectable, you can call this function to change the setting
for all of them<I> before</I> you create them.<A><!-- external link: 1D 3F C4 3B --> GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs
</A>cannot be used to change the attributes of existing segments.
<P>
You also can change the attributes of any single retained segment, but not
those created subsequently, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 55 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentAttrs</A>.
This is useful if, for example, you want most of the segments in a picture
chain to be detectable. You can change the attribute setting to detectable
for the entire chain, before creating it, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3F C4 FC --> GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>;
then, change the attribute to nondetectable for each of the segment exceptions
using<A><!-- external link: 1D 55 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentAttrs</A>. You
can also use<A><!-- external link: 1D 55 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentAttrs</A>,
for example, to make a visible segment invisible when an erase request is
received from the operator, or to take a segment out of the chain by redefining
it as unchained. If you change an unchained segment to chained, it is added
to the end of the segment chain. If you want the newly chained segment to
be positioned elsewhere in the chain, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 56 C4 3D --> GpiSetSegmentPriority
</A>rather than<A><!-- external link: 1D 55 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentAttrs</A>.

<P>
Some of these segment attributes apply equally to primitives that are outside
of segments, although their default settings cannot be changed. Primitives
outside of segments are always detectable and visible. They cannot be dynamic,
because the dynamic attribute applies only to retained graphics. The chained
and fast-chaining attributes do not apply to primitives outside of segments.
