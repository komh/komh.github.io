<H1>Deleting Graphics Segments</H1><!-- entering slot 94 -->
<P>
When you have finished drawing the subpicture associated with a segment,
you should delete the segment. The PM has two different functions that allow
you to delete segments.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Function<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 27 --> GpiDeleteSegment
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Deletes a retained segment<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 28 --> GpiDeleteSegments
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Deletes a range of retained segments.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Your application can only delete segments that have unique names because
you use the segment identifiers to identify the segment or range of segments
for deletion. Retained zero segments cannot be deleted. They disappear only
when their associated presentation space is deleted or reset. The presentation
space can be reset either by<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 29 --> GpiResetPS
</A>with the GRES_SEGMENTS flag or the GRES_ALL flag set, or by<A><!-- external link: 1D 53 C4 FC --> GpiSetPS</A>.
Resetting the presentation space is described in<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C5 53 --> Reusing
the Presentation Space</A>.
<P>
If<A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 27 --> GpiDeleteSegment</A> occurs within
a segment bracket and the segment identified is the currently open segment,
the operating system deletes the segment and ignores the remainder of the
functions up to, and including,<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC --> GpiCloseSegment</A>.
If<A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 27 --> GpiDeleteSegment</A> occurs within
a segment bracket and the identifier for a segment other than the currently
open segment, the operating system deletes the segment, then continues processing
the remaining functions in the segment bracket. If<A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 27 --> GpiDeleteSegment
</A>occurs outside of a segment and references a segment in the segment
chain, the operating system removes the segment from the chain and links
the two adjacent segments, if such segments exist.
<P>
If the range of segments deleted by<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 28 --> GpiDeleteSegments
</A>were in the segment chain, the operating system "repairs" the chain
by linking the segments immediately preceding and following the deleted
segments, if such segments exist.
