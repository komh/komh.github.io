<H1>Region Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 326 -->
<P>
Regions do not have a distinct ...BUNDLE data structure associated with
them. Unlike primitives or even paths, the purpose of regions is to provide
a definition for an operation-not visual output. However, there are two
functions that present the region as a visible entity.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 3F -->GpiPaintRegion</A> paints a region
in the presentation space. This function accepts only the region handle
as input.<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 3F --> GpiPaintRegion</A> does
not cause graphics orders to be added to the current segment. (Graphics
orders are the smallest, most complete portions of a segment.) Therefore,
in retain or draw-and-retain modes, you are advised to use paths or areas
rather than regions to ensure the desired effect.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C3 3E -->GpiFrameRegion</A> draws a frame around
a region by tracing the inner perimeter with a rectangle of a specified
size. This function accepts the region handle and the desired frame thickness
as input.
<P>
A region's visible output is controlled by the following AREABUNDLE attributes:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern symbol<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern set<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern reference point<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area background color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area foreground mix<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These attributes follow the current definitions and appear just as area
primitives do. The operating system uses the pattern symbol to fill the
interior of the region. Any alterations to the fill pattern or reference
point affects the appearance of a region, just as it does in an area.
<P>
Because neither the painted region nor the region frame have boundary lines,
no LINEBUNDLE attributes influence the appearance of a region resulting
from<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 3F --> GpiPaintRegion</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C3 FC --> GpiFrameRegion</A>.
