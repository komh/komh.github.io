<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 30 -->GpiPolyLine</A> draws a sequence of
connected lines, starting at the current position and passing through a
series of specified coordinate positions, as shown in the following figure.
After drawing the series of lines, the current position is at the end point
of the last line specified by<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 FC --> GpiPolyLine</A>.

<P>
If you are drawing a graph that has five connected lines, you can use<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 30 --> GpiPolyLine
</A>once rather than<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 2E --> GpiLine</A> five
times.<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 30 --> GpiPolyLine</A> accepts as
input a number of points and an array of point coordinates.

The starting position is (2,2), and the polyline is drawn through (4,4),
(6,4), (8,6), and (10,3).  The new current position is (10,3).

<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C3 31 -->GpiPolyLineDisjoint</A> is a new function
that eliminates having to use a series of<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 2F --> GpiMove
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 2E --> GpiLine</A> functions to draw
multiple lines that are not connected.<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C3 31 --> GpiPolyLineDisjoint
</A>accepts as input an even number, the number of points, and an array
of point coordinates. The first point in a point-pair is the starting point;
the second, the end point of that line segment. Upon completion, the end
point of the final line becomes the current position. The following figure
shows the results of a<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C3 31 --> GpiPolyLineDisjoint
</A>call.
