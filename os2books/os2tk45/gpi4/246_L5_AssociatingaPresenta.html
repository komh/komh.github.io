<H1>Associating a Presentation Space</H1><!-- entering slot 258 -->
<P>
In order to print, a device context must be associated with a GPI presentation
space (PS).
<P>
In most circumstances, a presentation space already exists for the screen.
In such cases, the PS can be disassociated with the window device context
and associated with the printer device context by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 FC --> GpiAssociate</A>,
as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="246_L5_AssociatingaPresenta_61.gif" WIDTH=570 HEIGHT=570>
<P>
Reassociating Presentation Space with Device Contexts
<P>

<P>
If a presentation space does not exist or a different one is to be used,
the application must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 46 --> GpiCreatePS
</A>and use the GPI_ASSOC flag to associate the printer device context.

<P>
<B>Device-Independence Considerations</B>
<P>
The operating system supports true<I> WYSIWYG</I>. The same GPI functions
the application used to create the picture or document on the display screen
can be used to create the output on a printer. This is the major advantage
of device independence.
<P>
An application must be designed around the options provided by the PM to
ensure device independence, as a display (VGA) typically is 96 dpi, while
a printer typically is 300 dpi.
<P>
Following are some application design considerations:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use DevQueryHardopyCaps to determine the horizontal
and vertical width of the form and the maximum printable area.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create a presentation space with a presentation page
size of 0 to ensure that the maximum window size and maximum page size are
used.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use device-independent coordinates, such as LO_ENGLISH,
or TWIPS. If you program in pels, transferring your output from screen to
hard copy will compress the image, as shown in the following figure.

<P>
An Effect of Programming in Pels
<P>
Reassociating a presentation space defined in pels or other device dependent
units can affect the dimension of the picture.  If the pels are not square
on the display device, the shape and scale (aspect ratio) will be different
as well.
