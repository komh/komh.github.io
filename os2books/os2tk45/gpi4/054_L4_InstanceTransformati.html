<P>
Instance transformations provide a way of defining the model transformation
drawing attribute for the duration of a called segment.
<P>
Instance transformations alter the retained-drawing output from special
segments referred to as<I> called</I> segments. A called segment usually
contains a subpicture duplicated several times in other subpictures. The
instance transformation positions, sizes, and rotates the subpicture each
time the segment is duplicated, because the transformation is set each time
the segment is called. An instance transformation applies only to the called
segment, and is reset on return to the calling segment. There is no query
function associated with the transformation as it must be explicitly set
for each called segment.
<P>
To apply an instance transformation, applications call<A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C3 24 --> GpiCallSegmentMatrix
</A>from the calling segment.<A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C3 24 --> GpiCallSegmentMatrix
</A>calls the segment and also applies the model transformation's scaling,
rotation, and translation values in a one-dimensional array representing
elements in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 2B --> MATRIXLF</A> structure
and passes a segment identifier.
