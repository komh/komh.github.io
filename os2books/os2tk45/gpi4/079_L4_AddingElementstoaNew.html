<H1>Adding Elements to a New Segment</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
There are four ways of adding elements to a newly created segment:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call one or more GPI functions. Each function generates
one element of the segment. This is the simplest way of supplying graphics
data to a segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 FC --> GpiBeginElement</A>,
and follow it with one or more GPI functions. Close the element using<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC --> GpiEndElement</A>.
All the GPI functions enclosed within the bracket and<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 32 --> GpiBeginElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 34 --> GpiEndElement</A> generate
a single element of the segment, and therefore occupy a single-element-pointer
position. Subsequently, the graphics orders cannot be accessed individually
with the element pointer, although the orders can be accessed directly,
for example, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 FC --> GpiGetData</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 FC --> GpiElement</A>.
As input, you supply the graphics orders themselves, rather than the GPI
functions that generate them. No matter how much data you supply on this
request, it is considered a single element of the segment.
<P>
Multiple orders added to a segment in this way cannot be accessed individually
using the element pointer, but they can be accessed directly, for example,
using<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 FC --> GpiGetData</A>.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 33 -->GpiElement</A> cannot be included
within a<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 FC --> GpiBeginElement</A>-<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC -->GpiEndElement
</A>bracket. The data passed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 33 --> GpiElement
</A>must not include<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 32 --> GpiBeginElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC --> GpiEndElement</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 FC --> GpiPutData</A>.
As with<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 FC --> GpiElement</A>, supply graphics
orders as input. You can even include<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 32 --> GpiBeginElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 34 --> GpiEndElement</A> orders in
this data, and thus add more than one element to the segment.<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 36 --> GpiPutData
</A>is useful when there is a large amount of data to add to a segment.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 36 -->GpiPutData</A> cannot be used if the
segment editing mode is set to SEGEM_REPLACE. When the segment editing mode
is SEGEM_INSERT, the element pointer must point to the last element in the
current segment. The segment editing mode can be set by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3B C4 FC --> GpiSetEditMode</A>..

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 36 -->GpiPutData</A> is most often used
in conjunction with<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 FC --> GpiGetData</A>,
which copies data as a list of drawing orders from a segment to application
storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
