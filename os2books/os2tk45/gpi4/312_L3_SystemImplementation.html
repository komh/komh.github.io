<P>
Regions are device-dependent objects and, therefore, are associated with
a particular device. For this reason, when an application specifies a presentation
space as input to one of the region functions, that presentation space must
be associated with a device context. The associated device context serves
to identify the device. Because a region is specific to the device for which
it was created, a region should not be created for one device and then used
for another.
<P>
If the device is a printer, a metafile can be used to store region functions
as<I> escapes</I>, and the resulting metafile can be displayed on any device.
The appearance of the result of any region function is affected by differences
in the pel:aspect ratio and device resolution on different printers.
<P>
Most of the region-oriented functions use the<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 54 --> RECTL
</A>structure to define the device-space coordinates of the rectangle. When
an application creates a rectangle in a device space and passes its coordinates
to a region function, the operating system excludes the top and rightmost
edges of the rectangle. This means that an application must add 1 to the
values in the<I> xRight</I> and<I> yTop</I> fields of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 54 --> RECTL
</A>structure to obtain the desired dimensions. For example, if an application
requires a region that measures 100-by-100 device units, with a lower-left
corner at (10,10),<I> xRight</I> and<I> yTop</I> should be set to 111 instead
of 110.
