<H1>Deleting Logical Fonts and Unloading Physical Fonts</H1><!-- entering slot 135 -->
<P>
A logical font can be used only by the application that defines it. The
logical font definition is stored in the presentation space and is saved
on the LIFO stack with its lcid when<A><!-- external link: 1D 1B C4 33 --> GpiSavePS
</A>is called. Unlike a physical font definition, a logical font definition
is temporary and is lost when the presentation space is deleted.
<P>
To specifically delete a logical font, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 81 C3 FC --> GpiDeleteSetId</A>,
which deletes the logical font, and makes its lcid available for reuse.
Sometimes this is necessary because there are only 255 lcids available.
The logical font must not be the current font when you call<A><!-- external link: 1D 81 C3 FC --> GpiDeleteSetId</A>.

<P>
Logical fonts are deleted to release the lcid and free memory. Unload private
fonts using<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C4 35 --> GpiUnloadFonts</A> to
free memory and to make them no longer available. Uninstall public fonts
using the Control Panel to free memory and to make them no longer available.

<P>
You must end the association between physical and logical fonts<I> before
</I>calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C4 FC --> GpiUnloadFonts</A>.
<P>
If you call<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C4 35 --> GpiUnloadFonts</A> to
unload a private font file, you must end the association between the physical
fonts in that file and the logical fonts defined by the application. Do
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2D C4 34 --> GpiSetCharSet
</A>to select a current font (such as the default font) that is not linked
to the physical fonts you are unloading<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 81 C3 32 --> GpiDeleteSetId
</A>to delete each logical font that refers to any of the physical fonts
in the font resource file. If you fail to do this, an error is returned
to your application from<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C4 FC --> GpiUnloadFonts</A>.
*GpiUnloadFonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
