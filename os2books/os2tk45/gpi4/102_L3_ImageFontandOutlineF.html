<H1>Image Font and Outline Font Implementation</H1><!-- entering slot 103 -->
<P>
The operating system can define and implement the characters of a font as
either images or outlines.
<P>
Each of the characters in an<I> image font</I> (sometimes called a<I> raster
font</I>) is created by alternating the ON and OFF settings of pels to produce
the image. The image characters are stored as a bit map. Sometimes image
fonts are even referred to as<I> bit-map fonts</I>.
<P>
The characters in an image font must be drawn in a fixed size-you cannot
rotate or scale them, for example-but usually they are of good quality.
They are displayed faster than outline characters, and frequently they look
better at low resolutions.
<P>
The characters in an<I> outline font</I>, on the other hand, are drawn using
a sequence of lines and arcs. Then the characters are filled if so requested.
The outline characters are stored as a collection of line, fillet, and spline
functions. Outline fonts are transformable because the outline characters
can be scaled, rotated, and sheared. Outline fonts can be implemented as
vectors, drawn by a series of small, straight lines. If that is the case,
they can be referred to correctly as<I> vector fonts</I>. Vector fonts can
be drawn much faster than fonts requiring the inclusion of actual curves
and arcs.
<P>
A major advantage of outline fonts is their device independence. Unlike
image fonts, whose appearance depends on the device's pel definition.
<P>
The following figure is an example of a character in both an image font
and an outline font.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="102_L3_ImageFontandOutlineF_23.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=362>

Image and Outline Characters
<P>
The image character is produced by manipulating pels. The outline character
is produced by drawing a sequence of lines and arcs. (The resultant shape
of an outline character can be filled if desired.)
<P>
Most of the functions and data structures described in this chapter relate
only to outline fonts.
