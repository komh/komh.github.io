<H1>Drawing a Character String Primitive</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
To draw a string of one or more graphics characters from the current font,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> GpiCharString</A>. The string
starts at the current position and, when it has been drawn, the new current
position is the point at which the next character would be, had there been
one.
<P>
To draw the string starting at a position other than the current position,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 FC --> GpiCharStringAt</A>. This is
equivalent to calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 2B --> GpiSetCurrentPosition
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> GpiMove</A>, followed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> GpiCharString</A>.
You supply the text of the character string as a parameter to the appropriate
GPI function.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> You also can call WinDrawText, which draws text to the screen
a line at a time. WinDrawText differs from the GpiCharString... functions
in that WinDrawText ignores the DM_RETAIN drawing mode and can only be used
to draw to a window device context.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
