<H1>Primitive Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 284 -->
<P>
The graphics primitives and the functions that draw them are discussed in
<A HREF="145_L1_LineandArcPrimitives.html">Line and Arc Primitives</A> through
<A HREF="100_L1_Fonts.html">Fonts</A>. The primitive's function allows the
attributes of the primitive to be set for all subsequent use of that primitive.
The attributes are stored in data structures called<I> bundles</I>. There
are functions that allow you to set the attributes of the primitives before
the drawing of any primitive is performed.<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 29 --> GpiSetAttrs
</A>allows you to not only specify the primitive for which the attributes
are going to be set, but also, the settings for the specific attributes.
<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C3 27 -->GpiQueryAttrs</A> returns the current
values of specified attributes for specified primitives.
<P>
Two other functions,<A><!-- external link: 1D 1F C4 28 --> GpiSetAttrMode
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C3 FC --> GpiQueryAttrMode</A>, enable
you to define or query the attribute mode settings, AM_PRESERVE and AM_NOPRESERVE.
The AM_PRESERVE setting preserves the value of an attribute any time that
attribute is changed. The previous value can be recovered easily if, for
example, you need six dotted lines, one solid line, then six more dotted
lines. The AM_NOPRESERVE setting discards the previous value of an attribute
once the value is changed. The values of the attributes are presentation
space resources.
