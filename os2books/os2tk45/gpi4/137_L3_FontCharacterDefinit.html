<H1>Font Character Definitions</H1><!-- entering slot 142 -->
<P>
Two formats of font character definition are supported. These are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Image format</B><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> The character glyphs are represented
as pel images.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Outline format</B><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> The
character glyphs are represented by vector data that traces the outline
of the character.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Intelligent Font Technology fonts (such as ATM Type-1 fonts)
may be stored in a technology specific format, and thus will not conform
to this definition for outline fonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 18 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The definition consists of a header portion and a portion carrying
the characters themselves.
<P>
The header portion contains information about the format of the character
definitions and data about each character including width data and the offset
into the definition section at which the character definition begins. (See
<A HREF="143_L3_DefinitionsofTermsUs.html">Definitions of Terms Used When
Describing Fonts</A>.)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Proportional characters (a+b+c = character increment)
for each character: a,b,c &gt;= 0<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Characters where a, b, and c are definitions
for all characters: b &gt;= 0
<BR>
a, c any integer
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Raster fonts contain a "null character". The character definition record
for this occurs after the one for the last character. Thus the format has
usLastChar+2 characters, although the null character is not counted in the
range returned. The null character is composed of zeros and is always eight
pels wide.
