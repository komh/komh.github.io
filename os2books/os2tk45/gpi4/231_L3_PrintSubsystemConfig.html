<H1>Print Subsystem Configuration</H1><!-- entering slot 241 -->
<P>
From a user's viewpoint, a printer object represents a printer. The user
can specify the printer object settings for configuration; for example,
which printer driver and port to use.
<P>
From a programmer's viewpoint, print configuration is more complicated.
Each printer object actually consists of a queue connected to a logical
device. The following figure shows some example configurations. The top-left
and top-right pictures show one printer object; the bottom-left picture
shows two printer objects; the bottom-right picture shows three printer
objects.

Example Configurations of Queues, Devices, and Printer Objects
<P>

<P>
Multiple queues connected to a single device is termed<I> printer sharing</I>.
The advantage of printer sharing is that two queues can have different configurations
or be used for different purposes. For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One queue could be used for small jobs that are needed
quickly, and the other could be used for large jobs printed during times
of low demand, such as overnight.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One queue could be used for a normal form such as
a letter, and the other could be for a special form and so, would be held.
When the special form was loaded into the printer, that queue could be released
and the normal form queue could be held.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A single queue connected to multiple devices is termed<I> printer pooling</I>.
This allows print jobs to be shared among printers for<I> load balancing</I>.
The spooler does this by printing a job on the next available printer. For
example, one printer usually reserved exclusively for special forms could
be connected to a normal form queue during peak loads. The special form
queue would be held temporarily.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Configuration of a device without a queue is not allowed by
the OS/2 operating system.
<P>
The logical device has the following configuration parameters that are relevant
to application programmers:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Name and description<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Logical
port (for example, LPT1)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>List of printer drivers
<P>
For example, a logical device representing an HP LaserJet printer with an
installed PostScript option could have both the HP LaserJet printer driver
and the PostScript printer driver in its configuration.
<P>
Each printer driver in the list also could have printer properties associated
with it.<I> Printer properties</I> describe the physical configuration of
the printer, such as what size paper is installed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The queue has the following configuration parameters that are relevant to
application programmers:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Name and description
<P>
It is the queue<I> description</I> not the queue<I> name</I> that is used
for the printer object title- that is, the text displayed beneath a printer
object icon.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Printer driver<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Default job properties
<P>
<I>Job properties</I> describe the parameters that must be used for printing
a specific job. An example of a job property is the orientation. The queue's
job property defaults are used if none are supplied by the application.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Queue driver<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Flags for<B> Printer-specific format</B> and<B> Print
while spooling</B> settings<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Separator page<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Start and stop times<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The configuration data for printer objects is stored in the OS2SYS.INI file.
The spooler provides a set of functions that can be used to query and set
this data.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Older PM applications might still use the Profile functions
(for example, PrfQueryProfileString). If so, these applications must be
recoded with the new functions to avoid any dependencies on where and how
the system stores configuration data.
