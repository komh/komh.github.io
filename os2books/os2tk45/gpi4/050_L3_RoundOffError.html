<H1>Round-Off Error</H1><!-- entering slot 51 -->
<P>
Whenever an application uses transformations, it should handle any round-off
error that occurs after multiple scaling, rotation, shear, or reflection
transformations. The rounding error increases because a transformation is
incrementally updated by the amount of the error with, for example, the
TRANSFORM_ADD option. For the rotation to remain accurate, the application
should recalculate the transformation, rather than accumulate many small
changes.
<P>
For example, if an application uses a rotation transformation to rotate
the hands of a clock, the accuracy of the clock diminishes due to rounding
off after the transformation. The rounding error should be periodically
removed by using the TRANSFORM_REPLACE option at known points, for example,
every 90Â° or every complete revolution of the clock.
