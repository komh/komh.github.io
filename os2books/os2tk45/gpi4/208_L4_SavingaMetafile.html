<H1>Saving a Metafile</H1><!-- entering slot 218 -->
<P>
A metafile is not a permanent object and, unless it is explicitly saved,
disappears when the application that creates it ends. Metafiles are saved
in disk files by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 1A C4 FC --> GpiSaveMetaFile</A>.

<P>
This function accepts as input the metafile handle and the name of the disk
file in which the metafile is to be saved. As the disk file is created by
this function, an error condition is raised if a file with this name already
exists. When you call<A><!-- external link: 1D 1A C4 FC --> GpiSaveMetaFile</A>,
the memory version of the metafile is deleted. Its handle is no longer valid,
until the file is reloaded from disk.
