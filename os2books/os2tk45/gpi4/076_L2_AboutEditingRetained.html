<H1>About Editing Retained Graphics and Graphics Segments</H1><!-- entering slot 77 -->
<P>
In the OS/2 operating system, applications store retained graphics in<I> segments</I>.
One of the advantages of using graphics segments is that segments can be
edited, which allows the retained image to be modified without having to
re-create the unmodified portion with multiple GPI functions.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C5 2E -->Creating and Drawing Retained Graphics
</A>described how to create a segment, and store GPI functions within the
<I>segment bracket</I> (the GPI functions bracketed by<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 47 --> GpiOpenSegment
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC --> GpiCloseSegment</A>). To understand
how to edit a segment, the underlying structure of a segment is described
here in greater detail.
<P>
The GPI functions are not inserted directly into a segment bracket. Instead,
the operating system converts the GPI functions into<I> graphics orders</I>.
A graphics order, also known as a drawing order, is the smallest complete
portion of a segment. Once the GPI functions are converted into graphics
orders, these orders are stored in the<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 FC --> GpiOpenSegment</A>-<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC -->GpiCloseSegment
</A>bracket.
<P>
Generally, each of the GPI functions within the segment bracket generates
one<I> element</I> of the segment. An element is the smallest portion of
a segment that can be edited and is made up of one or more orders. The following
figure illustrates the levels of graphic segment construction.

Structure of a Graphics Segment
<P>
Elements 0, 2, and 3 are each composed of a single order. Element 1 is composed
of two orders bracketed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 41 --> GpiBeginElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC --> GpiEndElement</A>.
