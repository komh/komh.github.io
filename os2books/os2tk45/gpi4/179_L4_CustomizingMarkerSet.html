<P>
If the current marker set does not contain a symbol that suits your application,
you can load a new marker set and select a marker symbol from that set.
The only way to see the current marker set is to display it on the screen
or view a hardcopy of the symbols. You load a new marker set for a specified
presentation space by creating a logical font. Then you select the font
as a marker set by specifying the logical font identifer (<I>lcid</I>) as
an input parameter to<A><!-- external link: 1D 47 C4 FC --> GpiSetMarkerSet</A>.
After selecting the marker set, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 45 C4 22 --> GpiSetMarker
</A>to select a marker from the set. You can set both values simultaneously,
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 FC --> GpiSetAttrs</A>.
<P>
You can use any font's character set as a marker set and any character within
that marker set as a marker. To determine the value that identifies the
current marker set, call<A><!-- external link: 1D F2 C3 FC --> GpiQueryMarkerSet</A>.
To determine the value that identifies the current marker character, call
<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC -->GpiQueryMarker</A>. You can retrieve
both values simultaneously with<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C3 FC --> GpiQueryAttrs</A>.
You also can create image marker symbols using the Font Editor.
