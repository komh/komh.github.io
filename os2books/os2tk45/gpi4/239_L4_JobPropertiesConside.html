<H1>Job Properties Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 250 -->
<P>
<I>Job properties</I> are options on a per-job basis- for example, orientation,
resolution, and form selection. The job properties dialog is displayed by
the printer driver. Each driver has a different dialog, depending on the
capabilities of the printer. The job properties are held in a printer driver-specific
format in the<I> abGeneralData</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C4 1C --> DRIVDATA
</A>structure.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Job properties from one printer driver should not be given
to another printer driver; the job properties probably will not be understood,
and the printer driver will either return an error or substitute some default
job properties. Then the user will see a change in job properties stored
previously.
<P>
The user should be given the opportunity to change the job properties before
the job is printed. This can be achieved by supplying a<B> Job properties
</B>push button on the printer setup dialog.
<P>
Changing job properties requires two steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
