<H1>Multiple-Arc Primitive Family</H1><!-- entering slot 170 -->
<P>
The following table describes the three variants of the simple-arc primitive
and the functions that draw them. As with line primitives, an application
draws simple arcs by first using<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 26 --> GpiMove
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 2A --> GpiSetCurrentPosition</A> to
set the current position. The multiple arcs are the most sophisticated of
the arc primitives and their construction does not depend on the current
arc parameters.
