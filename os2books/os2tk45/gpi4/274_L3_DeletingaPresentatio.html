<H1>Deleting a Presentation Space</H1><!-- entering slot 287 -->
<P>
A presentation space consumes a considerable amount of memory, so you should
delete it when your application no longer requires it. Use<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C3 10 --> GpiDestroyPS
</A>to delete either a normal or micro presentation space.
<P>
When you finish using a cached micro presentation space that you accessed
with WinGetPS, release it with WinReleasePS. You need not delete a presentation
space that you accessed with WinBeginPaint. PM does this for you when you
call WinEndPaint.
