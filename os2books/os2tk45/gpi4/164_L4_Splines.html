<A><!-- external link: 1D B1 C3 27 -->GpiPolySpline</A> creates a succession
of one or more<I> Bezier splines</I>. The spline also is a curve, but its
construction method is different from that of the fillet. As input to this
function, you supply three construction points for each spline. The first
spline starts from the current position and ends at the third specified
point. The two intermediate points are control points for the curve. Subsequent
splines start at the end point of the previous spline, have two intermediary
control points, and end at the third control point. The following figure
shows the construction method for the spline.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="164_L4_Splines_48.gif" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=301>

The Spline
<P>
Points (1) and (2) are the control points of the spline, and point (3) is
the end point.
<P>

<P>
To avoid discontinuity of gradient between the end of one spline and the
start of the next, ensure that the last two construction points of the first
spline and the first two construction points of the second spline are positioned
along a single construction line. This concept is shown in the following
figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="164_L4_Splines_49.gif" WIDTH=494 HEIGHT=380>

Spline with No Discontinuity of Gradient
<P>
The last two points of the first spline (points 2 and 3) are positioned
along the same construction line as the first two points (current position
and point 1) of the second spline.
