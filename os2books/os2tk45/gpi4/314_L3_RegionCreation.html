<H1>Region Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 327 -->
<P>
Areas and paths are created and defined within a bracket. Regions are defined
by a single function,<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>.
As input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>, supply
the total number of, and the coordinates for, each rectangle that contributes
to the region. The following applies to region coordinates:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They define the bottom left and top right coordinates
of each rectangle that makes up the region.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They must be in the range -32768 through +32767.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They always are device coordinates, because regions
always are created and drawn in an application's device space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The output from<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 34 --> GpiCreateRegion</A> is
the<I> region handle</I>, which identifies the region for subsequent operations.
Because each region can be distinctly identified, the region functions allow
applications to work with more than one region at a time.
<P>
For example, an application can combine two regions with<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 33 --> GpiCombineRegion
</A>or compare two regions with GpiEqualRegion. GpiQueryRegionRects retrieves
the coordinates of the rectangles that make up a region, enabling an application
to create a copy of that region. To create the copy, you supply, as input
to a new<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>, the
exact rectangles returned from<A><!-- external link: 1D 05 C4 FC --> GpiQueryRegionRects</A>.
