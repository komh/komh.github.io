<H1>Glyphs, Code Pages, and Code Points</H1><!-- entering slot 109 -->
<P>
The image or picture that you associate with each character or symbol in
a font is called a<I> glyph</I>. The mapping between a set of glyphs and
their<I> code points</I> is called a<I> code page</I>.
<P>
For a single byte character set (SBCS), each code page contains up to 256
code points. Normally these are 8-bit integers in the range 0 through 255,
with one code point identifying one glyph in that code page. The code pages
can be either ASCII or EBCDIC. Because a code point repeats on a new code
page, you need both the code page and code point to uniquely identify a
glyph.
<P>
There usually is one code page per font. However, double byte character
sets (DBCS) are sometimes used for Asian languages with large character
sets. Fonts are a set of glyph definitions and a default code page mapping.
The same set of font glyph definitions is remapped for different code pages.

<P>
Each font contains four special glyph points:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First glyph<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Last glyph<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Default glyph<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Break glyph<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
First and last glyph points are of more interest to the font designers than
application programmers because they apply to the set of font glyph definitions
rather than a particular code page. The last character is the maximum code
point of the font that has a glyph associated with it and may be bigger
than 256.
<P>
The default glyph appears in text when an application specifies a glyph
point that does not exist in the font.
<P>
The break glyph usually is the space character and often has the same code
point as the default character.
<P>
Actually a font can have more or less than 256 definitions, but any particular
code page may have less than 256 but no more. There may be a translation
between the code point in the code page and the code point (between the
first and last glyphs) that references the glyph in the font.
<P>
The operating system assigns unique identifiers to each of its code pages.
Common code pages are 437-the United States code page, and 850-the multilingual
code page. The default code page is 850.
<P>
An application can determine the current code page by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D0 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCp</A>.
or it can assign a new code page using<A><!-- external link: 1D 32 C4 FC --> GpiSetCp</A>.
If you default the code page in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C4 40 --> FATTRS
</A>structure when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogFont</A>,
you get the current code page as specified by<A><!-- external link: 1D 32 C4 4F --> GpiSetCp
</A>(or returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D D0 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCp</A>).
You can specify any one of the code page identifiers returned to you from
WinQueryCpList.
<P>
When using a font other than the system font, you specify the required code
page in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C4 40 --> FATTRS</A> structure of
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC -->GpiCreateLogFont</A>. You can determine
the code page for that font (if it is the current logical font) by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D E3 C3 FC -->GpiQueryFontMetrics</A>.
