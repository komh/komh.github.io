<H1>Page-Space to Device-Space Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 62 -->
<P>
There is only one transformation between the page coordinate space and the
device space, the<I> device transformation</I>. The device transformation
enables applications to work in any presentation-page units regardless of
the target device. Unlike the transformations previously described, the
device transformation only scales and translates objects, and it is defined
by two rectangles.
<P>
The first rectangle is called the<I> presentation page</I>. Its location
is the bottom left origin and its dimensions are fixed. The second is called
the<I> page viewport</I>. Its location is the bottom left origin and its
dimensions can be varied.
<P>
The device transformation, which maps the picture in presentation-page space
to device space, happens automatically. The device transformation is established
when the presentation space is created, and ensures that graphics are displayed
in the correct size and, where possible, that their aspect ratio is preserved.

<P>
To modify the device transformation, applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D 4B C4 FC --> GpiSetPageViewport</A>.
Input for this function is the device coordinates of the lower-left and
upper-right corners of the page viewport. Applications should modify the
default device transformation only when it is necessary to use nonstandard
page units.
<P>
