<H1>Match Value</H1><!-- entering slot 115 -->
<P>
The match value is a number that identifies a physical font. It is allocated
to the font when the font is loaded. If the match value is less than 0,
the font is a<I> device font</I>; and, if the match value is greater than
0, the font is a<I> generic font</I>.
<P>
A device font is exclusive to the device with which it is associated, and
its match number is guaranteed to be unique only within the device driver.
If an application prints on a different printer, the application cannot
guarantee that the font will be identical just by specifying the match value.
A generic font is available on more than one device. The PM-supplied fonts,
for example, are generic fonts. Printer fonts always are device fonts, but
you also can and should use generic fonts with printers.
<P>
You can choose whether or not to use the match value to specify the font
when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogFont</A>.
Specifying the match value is easier but less flexible than the alternative,
which is to specify the font name and outline characteristics. For an image
font, the alternative is to specify the maximum baseline extent and average
character width of the required font.
