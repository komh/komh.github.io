<H1>Kerning</H1><!-- entering slot 111 -->
<P>
<I>Kerning</I>, like proportional spacing, is a type of letter spacing.
In a kerned font, some characters are allowed to overhang others and, therefore,
occupy an area that is less than each character's increment for that font.
Usually this feature is restricted to pairs of characters whose appearance
might benefit from greater proximity. The five character pairs that most
commonly benefit from kerning are<I> Yo</I>,<I> We</I>,<I> To</I><I> Tr</I>,
and<I> Ta</I>.
<P>
Kerning is not available in the system-provided image fonts. The Helvetica
and Times New Roman outline fonts provided with the system do include kerning
information. You can specify kerning as a requirement on the<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogFont</A>.
Selecting a kerned font lets kerning take place whenever it is defined.

<P>
The<I> a-space</I> is the area of the character cell before the character;
the<I> b-space</I> is the area of the character cell occupied by the character;
the<I> c-space</I> is the area of the character cell after the character.
The a-space and c-space are shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="108_L3_Kerning_25.gif" WIDTH=407 HEIGHT=403>

<P>
The best way to implement kerning is to use a kerning-pair table. The kerning
table will exist only for certain pairs of characters for which adjustments
are desirable.
<P>
Each of the entries in a kerning-pair table contains the code points of
a pair of kerned characters and an adjustment that should be applied to
the character width of the first character of the pair. A negative value
means that the space is decreased, and a positive value means it is increased,
whenever the two characters in a kerning pair are produced together. A kerning-pair
table might be provided with a purchased font. If so, it will be recorded
in the font header.
<P>
If kerning is specified on a character-pair basis (that is, if the font
has a kerning-pair table), the font has a specific number of kerned pairs.
<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C3 5E -->GpiQueryKerningPairs</A> returns kerning-pair
information from the current logical font. For each pair of kerned characters,
you are given the characters themselves and an adjustment in world coordinates
that must be applied to the character width of the first character of the
pair.
<P>
When you specify negative a- and c-space values, the values affect<I> any
</I>character paired with the kerned character. Because this form of kerning
cannot be applied selectively, you have to choose the kerned characters
carefully. For example, an italic letter f ( Æ’ ) is a good candidate for
this sort of kerning, because it can overhang most of the characters that
precede and follow it.
<P>
An application can adjust the amount of space between all characters in
a font with<A><!-- external link: 1D 2B C4 FC --> GpiSetCharExtra</A>. Any
extra space is added to font kerning values. An application also can adjust
the width of a font's break character (space) with<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C4 FC --> GpiSetCharBreakExtra</A>.

<P>
Kerning is not available on all devices. On devices that support kerning,
kerning is enabled by default. When kerning is not supported on a device,
kerning support is switched off by default. When kerning support is switched
off, the kerning information supplied with a font is ignored. To determine
whether a device supports kerning, use DevQueryCaps.
<P>
The kerning information can be implemented by your application when a character
string primitive is written to an output device. This is called<I> rendering
</I>the text.<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 5B --> GpiCharStringPos</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 FC -->GpiCharStringPosAt</A>, permit specification
of the starting position for each character. The entire character string
can be searched for character pairs that also are kerning pairs for the
kerning information to be applied.
