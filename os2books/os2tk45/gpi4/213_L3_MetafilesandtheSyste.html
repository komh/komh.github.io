<H1>Metafiles and the System Clipboard</H1><!-- entering slot 223 -->
<P>
A metafile that you have created or loaded can be made available to other
applications at the same workstation by placing the handle to the metafile
in the system clipboard. When a resource is passed to the clipboard, it
 becomes the property of the system, and is not deleted when the owning
application ends. Any application that can access the clipboard can retrieve
the handle to the metafile. Using the handle to the metafile, the application
should copy the metafile by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 6F C3 18 --> GpiCopyMetaFile
</A>before closing the clipboard. The application can then perform any metafile
operation on the metafile.
