<H1>Selecting the New Current Font</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->
<P>
In addition to completing the FATTRS structure, you must supply as input
to<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 1B --> GpiCreateLogFont</A> a unique lcid
for the font. The identifier is a number in the range of 1 through 254.
Because you can have more than one logical font definition in a presentation
space, you must select the current font by supplying the font's lcid as
input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 2D C4 FC --> GpiSetCharSet</A>.
<P>
You do not have to call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2D C4 1C --> GpiSetCharSet
</A>to use the default font. When you want to reset the current font to
its default value, however, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2D C4 1C --> GpiSetCharSet
</A>with the value LCID_DEFAULT. The current font, like other modal attributes,
reverts automatically to its default value when specific GPI functions are
called.
<P>
