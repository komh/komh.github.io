<P>
The viewing window is a conceptual boundary around a part of the model space.
To produce the picture in the previous figure, the aircraft is drawn twice.
The first time, the viewing window is on only the tail of the aircraft,
and the second time, the viewing window is on the entire aircraft. Only
those parts of the model space within the viewing window are visible in
the picture assembled in presentation-page space.<A><!-- external link: 1D 5B C4 10 --> GpiSetViewingLimits
