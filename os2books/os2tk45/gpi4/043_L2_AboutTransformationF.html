<H1>About Transformation Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
Transformation functions manipulate objects between coordinate spaces by
applying transformations. Transformation functions require two coordinate
spaces: a source coordinate space, and a target coordinate space. Which
transformation function an application should use is determined by the two
coordinate spaces and by the transformation effect desired.
<P>
The world-to-model space, model-to-page space, and page-to-device space
transformations are all actually performed as a single operation. The different
coordinate spaces are conceptual in nature, rather than explicitly defined
entities. Describing them separately is meant to help explain the levels
of activity during transformations.
<P>
All transformation functions share certain parameters, although the values
and defaults of those parameters might not be identical.
