<P>
Once the print process has been confirmed by the user. the application must
use a separate thread to perform the actual printing. This maintains user
responsiveness and avoids displaying the hourglass pointer. While the printing
is in progress, the application should dim certain menu options, such as
drawing. Other options, such as page down, zoom, or help still must be available.
