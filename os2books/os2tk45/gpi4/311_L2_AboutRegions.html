<H1>About Regions</H1><!-- entering slot 324 -->
<P>
A region consists of one or more overlapping or separate rectangles in an
application's device space. The sides of the rectangles are parallel to
the x- and y-axes in the device coordinate space. An irregular, nonrectangular
path can be converted into a region. However, unless otherwise specified,
the assumption of this chapter is that a region is rectangular.
<P>
If a region consists of intersecting rectangles, the intersecting sides
are always perpendicular. If the rectangles have no common elements, the
region is defined as separate rectangles.
<P>
Unlike areas and paths, which are defined in world coordinates, regions
are device-dependent and, so, are defined in device coordinates. The device
coordinates are<I> inclusive</I> (inside the rectangle) at the bottom and
left coordinate boundaries, and<I> exclusive</I> (outside the rectangle
and clipped) at the top and right boundaries.
<P>
Each region is created for the device that currently is associated with
a presentation space. Also, after creation, regions are available for various
operations; a<I> region handle</I> identifies the region for subsequent
operations.
<P>
The following figure shows a region that consists of two intersecting rectangles.
An application defined the region by passing an array containing the coordinates
for the two rectangles to<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> GpiCreateRegion</A>.
The application then drew the region with<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 FC --> GpiPaintRegion</A>.
