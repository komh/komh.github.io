<H1>Cosmetic Line Attributes for Paths</H1><!-- entering slot 305 -->
<P>
When a path is drawn as a cosmetic line with<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC --> GpiOutlinePath</A>,
the following attributes are defined by the<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C4 27 --> LINEBUNDLE
</A>data structure:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line width<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line type<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line mix<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
These attributes follow the current definitions and appear just as line
primitives do. Since the line primitive has only a foreground color and
mix attribute, the current color of the drawing surface affects the appearance
of these paths more than it does the appearance of paths that define geometric
lines. Those paths follow the area attributes and are affected by background
color and background mix attributes as well.
