<P>
Segments are made up of elements, which are in turn made up of one or more
graphic orders. The previous sections have discussed the properties and
functions for orders and elements. The following sections discuss the attributes
and functions that apply to segments as a whole.
<P>
The segment attributes are encoded in a segment prior to the graphics orders
that correspond to GPIs and attributes.
