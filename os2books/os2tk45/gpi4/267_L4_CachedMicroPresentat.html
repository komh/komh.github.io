<H1>Cached Micro Presentation Space</H1><!-- entering slot 280 -->
<P>
The window manager maintains a cache of micro presentation spaces for windows
on a display screen. The cache is provided for applications that use a large
number of windows, and where each window requires a temporary presentation-space
device-context pair for a short sequence of output operations. These presentation
spaces belong to the system rather than to your application and are allocated
only on a temporary basis.
<P>
Cached micro presentation spaces are provided by the window system rather
than by the GPI. Their use is synchronized with other window activities.
For example, you need not associate a cached micro presentation space with
the display screen. The window manager does this for you.
<P>
Cached micro presentation spaces offer the best system performance because,
unlike normal presentation spaces and standard micro presentation spaces,
they are not permanently allocated to an application. However, cached micro
presentation spaces can be cumbersome to use because all the attributes
must be initialized continually.
<P>
Use a cached micro presentation space to send output only to a window on
the display device. There are three different functions you can use to access
a cached micro presentation space, each with its own considerations. These
functions are listed in the following table.

<P>
In general, use a cached micro presentation space to process a single paint
message when no presentation space information needs to be remembered between
messages. The presentation space must be both obtained and released during
the processing of that message. All application information stored in a
cached micro presentation space is lost as soon as it is released to the
cache.
<P>
You must provide a window handle on input to WinBeginPaint and WinGetPS.
The resulting presentation space is defined specifically for that window,
and cannot be reassociated.
<P>
The cached micro presentation space is always:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Defined in<I> pels</I>-although you can change the
units using<A><!-- external link: 1D 53 C4 5D --> GpiSetPS</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Formatted GPIF_LONG<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Given a suitable size by the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When you finish using a cached micro presentation space, you do not have
to disassociate it from the window device context because WinReleasePS or
WinEndPaint performs the disassociation. This makes the cached micro presentation
space available for use in other windows. The presentation space itself
cannot be deleted.
<P>
Cached micro presentation spaces are used serially. The next time you need
a cached presentation space, access a new one using the appropriate function.
Each time you get a cached micro presentation space, graphics attributes
are reset to their default values.
