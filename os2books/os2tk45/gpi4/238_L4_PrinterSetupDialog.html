<H1>Printer Setup Dialog</H1><!-- entering slot 249 -->
<P>
In a printer setup dialog, an application should offer a list of printer
objects that are available to the user and enable the user to select one.
(The list of printer objects actually is a list of queues.) If none are
available, an appropriate message must be displayed. An application must
query the list of available printer objects each time the printer setup
dialog is displayed because the user might have created or modified the
printer configuration while the application was executing. The following
figure is an example of a printer setup dialog.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="238_L4_PrinterSetupDialog_58.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=346>

<B>Note: </B> If the document was formatted for a particular device and
the user selects a different printer, the application must ask the user's
permission before reformatting the document for the new printer.
<P>
Use SplEnumQueue to query the list of printers (printer objects);<I> printer
objects</I> essentially are spool queues. SplEnumQueue returns both a list
of queues and information about each queue on the local workstation in an
array of<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C4 81 --> PRQINFO3</A> structures.
It also returns information about local workstation queues that reference
network print queues.
<P>
Because the number of queues might vary for each use of your application,
it is essential to allocate sufficient storage to hold the data returned
by SplEnumQueue. Usually the application issues the query twice:  the first
time, the application determines the necessary size of the information buffer;
after allocating a memory block, the second query actually retrieves the
information.
<P>
The SplEnumQueue parameter<I> pcTotal</I> contains the number of queues
available on the local system. The application should display an appropriate
message box if the value is 0.
<P>
The queue description (returned in the structure<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C4 81 --> PRQINFO3
</A>field name<I> pszComment</I>) is the printer object title. This is much
more familiar to the user than the queue name, which is displayed only on
the view settings page of a printer object. Therefore, the printer setup
dialog should show the queue descriptions instead of the queue names.
<P>
SplEnumQueue returns information about the queue that might influence the
user's or application's decision to print to this queue; for example, the
queue priority, or the number of jobs already in the queue. SplEnumQueue
also returns the default job properties for the queue. This data can be
used by the application for the<B> Job properties</B> push button on the
printer setup dialog.
<P>
Less sophisticated applications might decide to dispense with the printer
setup dialog and just print to the default queue. The default queue can
be queried using PrfQueryProfileString, with an application name of PM_SPOOLER
and a keyname of QUEUE. The spooler function SplQueryQueue then can be called
to retrieve the default job properties.
