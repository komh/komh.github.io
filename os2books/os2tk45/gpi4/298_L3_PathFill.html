<H1>Path Fill</H1><!-- entering slot 311 -->
<P>
To draw the current path and fill its interior using the current pattern
symbol, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> GpiFillPath</A>. The path
is deleted after the interior is filled. The boundary lines are considered
part of the path interior and are drawn with this function. Any open figures
in the path definition are closed automatically by<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> GpiFillPath</A>.

<P>
This function accepts the path identifier (which must be 1) as input, and
either of two construction options:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->FPATH_ALTERNATE (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->FPATH_WINDING (must be selected if the path has been
modified).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Paths, like area primitives, can be filled in alternate mode or winding
mode. If the path consists of multiple, intersecting figures, the path-fill
mode affects the final appearance of the path.
<P>
The following figure shows two identical paths that were filled, each using
one of the two modes. Each path consists of a triangle drawn within a rectangle.
The path on the left was filled using the alternate mode. The path on the
right was filled using the winding mode.
