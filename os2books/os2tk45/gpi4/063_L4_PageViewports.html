<P>
A page viewport is a rectangle in device space, whose origin and size can
be varied. The operating system uses the presentation-page rectangle and
the page-viewport rectangle to define the device transformation.
<P>
An application can determine the current dimensions of the page viewport
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F9 C3 FC --> GpiQueryPageViewport</A>,
which returns a pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 38 --> RECTL
</A>structure that contains the coordinates of the viewport. The application
can set the location and dimensions of the page viewport by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 4B C4 1F --> GpiSetPageViewport
</A>and passing it a pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 38 --> RECTL
</A>structure that contains the new values.
<P>
The ratio of the page width to the page-viewport width defines a horizontal
scaling factor. The ratio of the page height to the viewport height defines
a vertical scaling factor. Applications can use DevQueryCaps to obtain the
horizontal and vertical resolution of a device in pels per meter. The dimensions
of a pel can vary from one device to another, but they usually fall in the
range of 0.25 to 0.50 mm.
<P>
The page viewport can be shifted in the device space by a translation transformation.
