<P>
Graphics elements are composed of either a single graphics order, or a series
of graphic orders that are bracketed by an opening and closing element function.

<P>
The purpose of this element bracket is to allow the addition of a single
element, that comprises more than one graphics order, to a segment. This
is most useful when you know that you will want to retrieve those orders
at a later time, and manipulate them as a group rather than as individual
functions.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> There is no reason for enclosing a single GPI function within
a<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 FC --> GpiBeginElement</A>-<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC -->GpiEndElement
</A>bracket, although it is a valid construction.
<P>
Element brackets also are valid when drawing graphics directly to the output
device, but again, they serve no purpose unless converted to a retained
segment at a later time. Elements cannot be nested, so two elements cannot
begin in succession without an intervening<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 2F --> GpiEndElement
</A>request. Certain GPI functions cannot be called between<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 2E --> GpiBeginElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC --> GpiEndElement</A>. For example,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C3 30 -->GpiLabel</A> cannot be used between
<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 2E -->GpiBeginElement</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 FC --> GpiEndElement</A>.

<P>
Element construction is valid only within segments.
