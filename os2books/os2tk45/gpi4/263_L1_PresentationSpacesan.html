<P>
A presentation space is a data structure maintained by the operating system
in which information relevant to the graphic output is stored. The information
is related to both the subsequent drawings (such as colors or line styles)
and the presentation space resources (such as color tables or fonts).
<P>
The first task in a graphics application is to define a presentation space,
because so many of the GPI functions must operate within them. A presentation
space is required for each output device currently in use by your application,
including each separate window on the display screen. In almost all cases,
the presentation space is set up to be<I> device-independent</I>, because
the requirements of each possible output device are so different.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In some cases, it is possible to disassociate a presentation
space from one device and associate it with another, thereby allowing the
presentation space to be shared.
<P>
To facilitate the device independence of the PM programming interface, all
device-specific information is held in a device context. A device context
is a data structure that identifies a particular instance of an output device
and contains all the device-specific information, such as the logical name
of the device and the presentation driver name. Each separate instance of
an output device that you intend to use must be described in a device context.
For example, if a single application uses more than one window, each of
those windows must have its own window device context.
<P>
The applicable device context, then, must be<I> associated</I> with the
presentation space in order to send  graphics data to that output device.
