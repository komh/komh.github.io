<H1>Element Types</H1><!-- entering slot 81 -->
<P>
Each element that results from a single GPI function has an associated<I> element
type</I>.
<P>
The element type is generally the graphics-order code associated with the
graphics order generated by the GPI function, and is supplied by the system.
For example,<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 2E --> GpiLine</A> has the element
type, OCODE_GCLINE, which identifies it as a line-drawing request. Your
application can determine the current classification of an element using
<A><!-- external link: 1D DF C3 FC -->GpiQueryElementType</A>.
<P>
When using<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 2D --> GpiElement</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 FC --> GpiBeginElement</A>,
you can simultaneously add several graphics orders to a segment. Those orders
become one element of the segment. You can supply your own classification
for these compound elements by supplying a value for the type parameter
of<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 2D --> GpiElement</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 2C --> GpiBeginElement
</A>in the range of 0x81000000 through 0XFFFFFFFF.
<P>
For example, the orders passed by a single<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 2D --> GpiElement
</A>function could change the line type to dotted, set the current color
to blue, and draw a line. You could classify this element with a type value
that identifies it as a blue dotted line.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Element types are used only for classification. They are not
used as location markers or correlation tags.
