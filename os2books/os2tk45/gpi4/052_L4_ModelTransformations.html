<P>
Model transformations also can be applied to objects both inside and outside
of segments. Model transformations also can be applied to objects created
under retained or nonretained drawing mode. This means model transformations
affect the output from:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any GPI functions that occur outside of a retained-drawing
segment<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Applications can change the model transformation any number of times in
a single segment. Changing the model transformation changes the transformation
applied to any drawing primitives used subsequently.
<P>
An application can determine the values for the current model transformation
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 FC --> GpiQueryModelTransformMatrix</A>,
model transformation's scaling, rotation, and translation values in a one-dimensional
array representing elements in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 3E --> MATRIXLF
</A>structure.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 4A C4 36 -->GpiSetModelTransformMatrix</A> specifies
the model transformation's scaling, rotation, and translation values applied
to subsequent primitives in the segment. As this function does not require
the name a segment, it also can be used to apply transformations to primitives
outside of segments.
<P>
For example, in the building example earlier in the chapter, if the window
is stored in a retained segment, an application could draw several identical
windows on the house by setting a new translation component in the model
transformation before calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 FC --> GpiBox</A>.
