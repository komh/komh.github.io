<P>
A presentation page is a rectangle in a page space. Its lower-left corner
is always positioned at the origin of the page space.
<P>
An application can determine the dimensions of the presentation page by
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 02 C4 FC --> GpiQueryPS</A>. It returns
a pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 9C C4 3B --> SIZEL</A> structure
that contains the page dimensions. If an application specifies arbitrary
page units when creating a presentation space with<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC --> GpiCreatePS</A>,
the page viewport is constructed such that the origin of the page rectangle
maps to the origin of the default device rectangle and either the right
or top edge maps to the corresponding edge. Thus, the aspect ratio of the
graphic is preserved.
<P>
If either the height or width of the presentation page is set to 0 (using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC -->GpiCreatePS</A>), the application
must set GPIA_ASSOC to set the default presentation page size to the default
device rectangle size.
