<H1>Model Space-to-Page Space Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 57 -->
<P>
There are two transformations that operate between the model space and the
page space:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Viewing transformations<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Default viewing transformations<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
All three model transformation types and the viewing transformations can
be considered a part of the picture. The default viewing transformation
is part of the environment, and must not be used for picture construction.

<P>
Viewing transformations only apply in retained or nonretained segments.
The viewing transformation attribute is set to the presentation space viewing
transformation matrix value at the start of each drawn root segment and
remains constant for that segment. If<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C4 24 --> GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix
</A>is called, the new value is not used until the next segment is opened.
The matrix drawing attribute is reset to identity at the end of the segment.
Each change in a viewing transformation is equivalent to defining a new
model space.
<P>
The default viewing transformation is a presentation space attribute and
should not normally be modified in the middle of a picture. This attribute
can be updated by<A><!-- external link: 1D 36 C4 FC --> GpiSetDefaultViewMatrix</A>.

<P>
A picture is normally constructed in the presentation page with an identity
default viewing transformation. The default viewing transformation can then
be used to scale and scroll the entire picture in the presentation page.
