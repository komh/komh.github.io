<H1>Retrieving Job Properties</H1><!-- entering slot 251 -->
<P>
The application can retrieve job properties from the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Previously saved job properties with the document
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current application session job properties<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Default job properties from the queue (from<B> pDriverData
</B>in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C4 30 --> PRQINFO3</A> data structure)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Printer driver device defaults (from DevPostDeviceModes
using the DPDM_QUERYJOBPROP flag).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If no job properties were saved with the document, then there may be job
properties that are being used by another document that also is to be printed
to the same queue.
<P>
If job properties still cannot be found, then the default job properties
stored with the queue can be used. It may be that the user has not set up
any default job properties for the queue. Last, query the printer driver
for its device defaults using DevPostDeviceModes with the DPDM_QUERYJOBPROP
flag.
<P>
