<H1>Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 161 -->
<P>
At its simplest,<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox</A> draws
a rectangular box with one corner at the current position and the diagonally-opposite
corner at a position that you specify. The sides of the box are parallel
to the x- and y-axes. Like<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 FC --> GpiPolyLine</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 -->GpiBox</A> lets you draw a number
of connected lines using a single function rather than four separate<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 FC --> GpiLine</A>,
functions. The current position is unchanged by<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 FC --> GpiBox</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The start and end position of any closed shape are always
the same. Therefore the current position is unchanged after drawing a closed
figure. The<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox</A> primitive is
shown in the following figure.

<P>
The Box
<P>
The current position is (3,2) and the corner position is at (8,6).  When
the box has been drawn, the current position remains at (3,2).
<P>
In addition to the corner position,<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox
</A>accepts as input an option for rounded corners and for filled interior.
The PM programming interface rounds the corners of a box by drawing an elliptical
section in place of the square corner. Two<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox
</A>parameters,<I> IHRound</I> and<I> IVRound</I>, represent the horizontal
and vertical length of the full axis of the ellipse used to round each corner.
If the two values are equal, a quarter-circle is used for the rounding.
If the two values are 0, no rounding is performed. The following figure
shows an example of rounding corners using a quarter-circle.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="154_L4_Boxes_38.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=426> Quarter-Circle
Box-Corner Rounding
<P>
The current position is (20,20).<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox
</A>is called with a corner position of (65,60) and an identical vertical
and horizontal rounding value of 26.
<P>

The following figure shows the complete result. The intermediate steps are
not visible to the user of your application.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="154_L4_Boxes_39.gif" WIDTH=505 HEIGHT=429>
<P>
Box with Rounded Corners
<P>
All four corners are rounded with identical values.
<P>
Since<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 50 --> GpiBox</A> can be used to define
a closed figure, it also accepts as input a long value signifying a filled
interior. The long value<I> lControl</I> can be any of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Value<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DRO_OUTLINE
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Draw the box only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DRO_FILL
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Fill the box interior only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DRO_OUTLINEFILL
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Draw the box and fill its interior.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The pattern that fills the interior and other drawing options are controlled
by the data structure AREABUNDLE.<A><!-- external link: 1D 94 C3 51 --> GpiFullArc
</A>is the only other line and arc primitive that can be used to define
a closed figure.
