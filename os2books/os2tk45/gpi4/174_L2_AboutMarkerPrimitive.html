<H1>About Marker Primitives</H1><!-- entering slot 182 -->
<P>
Marker primitives always are drawn centered over a point. In a designated
presentation space,<A><!-- external link: 1D 9E C3 2C --> GpiMarker</A> draws
a single marker primitive of the current marker symbol, with its center
at a specified position. This position becomes the new current position
when the marker is drawn.
<P>
Another marker function,<A><!-- external link: 1D B0 C3 FC --> GpiPolyMarker</A>,
draws multiple marker primitives in the designated presentation space. Each
marker primitive is centered over a position specified in an input array
to<A><!-- external link: 1D B0 C3 FC --> GpiPolyMarker</A>. All marker primitives
drawn by a single call to<A><!-- external link: 1D B0 C3 2D --> GpiPolyMarker
</A>use the same (current) marker symbol. When a series of marker primitives
is drawn, the<I> current position</I> is the center point of the last marker
in the series. The following figure shows the use of marker primitives in
a line graph.

Marker Primitives
<P>
This example shows a sequence of diamond-shaped marker primitives drawn
on a line graph at (1,2), (3,4), (4,3), (7,5), (8,4), (9,8), (10,6), and
(11,6). The new current position is at (11,6). The marker portion of this
example could have been drawn with a single call to<A><!-- external link: 1D B0 C3 2D --> GpiPolyMarker
</A>or with eight separate<A><!-- external link: 1D 9E C3 2C --> GpiMarker
</A>calls.
