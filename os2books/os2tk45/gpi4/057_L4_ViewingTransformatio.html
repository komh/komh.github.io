<P>
More than one copy of an entire model space can be drawn in page coordinate
space, and each copy can be transformed as required. Parts of the model
space also can be transformed to the presentation page. For example, an
enlarged view of the tail of an aircraft can be shown with a reduced view
of the complete aircraft in one corner. This is shown in the following figure.

Presentation-Page Space
<P>
The entire model space (the aircraft) and a part of the model space (the
tail of the aircraft) are drawn to a single page coordinate space. In each
instance, scaling and translation transformations have been applied.
<P>
Alternatively, the displayed picture can be made up of several subpictures
with no common graphical elements. For example, the aircraft can be drawn
in one part of the display, and a map of an airport in another part of the
display. In this instance, the final picture would be derived from different
model spaces.
<P>
Whether multiple views are derived from a single model space or from different
model spaces, there are two items to address for each instance of a model
space incorporated into the presentation page:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The part of the model space to be displayed must
be identified by defining a<I> viewing window</I> for the model space.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To position and size the contents of the model
space in page coordinate space, a viewing transformation must be specified.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To get views of one or more model spaces on the screen simultaneously, each
model space is drawn the required number of times. Before each drawing request,
the viewing window is defined and a viewing transformation is specified.
