<P>
Before print processing actually starts, it is recommended that an application's
modal dialog be displayed, showing page progress and enabling the user to
cancel the print job. If the user presses<B> Cancel</B> on this dialog,
the application must call DevEscape with the parameter<I> DEVESC_ABORTDOC</I>.
This allows the spooler and printer driver to clean up. A job is not created
in the queue.
<P>
Usually the output on a page is generated by a series of GPI calls from
the application. By calculating the size of character strings or graphics
written to the presentation space, the application must be able to decide
when to move to the next page in a multi-page document.
