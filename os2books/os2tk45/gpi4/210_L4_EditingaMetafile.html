<H1>Editing a Metafile</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
Metafiles can be edited in a manner similar to editing graphics segments.
To edit graphics orders in a metafile, an application transfers them into
application storage (an array of bytes) by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> GpiQueryMetaFileBits</A>.
The number of graphics orders copied depends on the size of the array that
the application supplies. The application can determine the size of the
metafile (in bytes) by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F4 C3 FC --> GpiQueryMetaFileLength</A>.
When the application has finished editing the graphics orders, it can copy
them back into the metafile by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 48 C4 FC --> GpiSetMetaFileBits</A>.

<P>
Edited versions of metafiles can be saved by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 1A C4 FC --> GpiSaveMetaFile</A>.
The disk file that contains the edited version of the metafile cannot have
the same name as the file from which the metafile was originally loaded.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 1A C4 23 -->GpiSaveMetaFile</A> raises an error
condition if the disk file already exists.
