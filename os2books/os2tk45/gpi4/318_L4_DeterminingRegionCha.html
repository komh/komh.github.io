<H1>Determining Region Characteristics</H1><!-- entering slot 331 -->
<P>
Regions are used in many operations. There are several functions that determine
the characteristics of regions because these characteristics influence the
outcome of the operation being performed.
<P>
To determine whether two regions are identical, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 8D C3 FC --> GpiEqualRegion</A>.
This function accepts, as input, the two region handles. Regions are identical
if the only difference between them is an empty region. For example, a rectangular
region whose lower-left corner is at 10,10 is not identical to a region
whose lower-left corner is at 50,50, even if the regions have exactly the
same dimensions. The two regions also must be of the same device class to
be considered identical.
<P>
To determine the rectangles that compose a region, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 05 C4 FC --> GpiQueryRegionRects</A>,
which retrieves the coordinates of a series of rectangles that, when ORed
together, define the shape of the regions.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The individual regions returned may differ in size and number
from those originally used to specify the region.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 05 C4 41 -->GpiQueryRegionRects</A> accepts, as
input, the region handle and the maximum number of rectangles that can be
returned. The division of the region into multiple rectangles is handled
automatically by the PM.
<P>
It is not necessary for an application to retrieve all the rectangles in
a single function. Your application can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 05 C4 41 --> GpiQueryRegionRects
</A>any number of times. Therefore, the application must specify the maximum
number of rectangles and the rectangle number to start from in each function.

<P>
No assumptions can be made about the number and coordinates of rectangles
returned except that they will define the specified region precisely. The
purpose of specifying the number of rectangles in the query is to ensure
that the system does not return more coordinates than can fit in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 78 --> RECTL
</A>array.
<P>
To determine whether a point is inside the borders of a region, call<A><!-- external link: 1D B3 C3 FC --> GpiPtInRegion</A>.
This function is especially useful in applications that must determine whether
the mouse pointer is over a region. The particular point must be expressed
in device coordinates.
<P>
To determine whether any part of a specified rectangle lies within a region,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 13 C4 FC --> GpiRectInRegion</A>. This function
accepts, as input, the region handle and the rectangle as specified in device
coordinates.
<P>
To determine the coordinates of the smallest rectangle that encloses a region,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 04 C4 FC --> GpiQueryRegionBox</A>. This function
accepts the region handle as input. The output from this function tells
you whether the bounding region is rectangular, NULL, or complex.
