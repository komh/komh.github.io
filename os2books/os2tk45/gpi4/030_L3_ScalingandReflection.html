<H1>Scaling and Reflection Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 31 -->
<P>
Applications can scale an object by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 1C C4 40 --> GpiScale
</A>or by modifying the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 50 --> MATRIXLF</A> structure
directly. A scaling transformation reduces or increases the size of a graphics
object. A reflecting transformation creates a mirror image of an object
with respect to the x- or y-axis.
<P>
A scaling factor of:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->greater than 1 causes an increase in size<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->greater than 0 but less than 1 causes a reduction
in size<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->less than 0 causes a reflection about that axis. That
is, a negative x scaling factor causes reflection in the x direction.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If an application specifies a scaling factor of greater than
1, the graphics presentation space must be defined with the coordinate format
GPIF_LONG. This is because 32-bit matrix elements are required to store
these values in retained segment and metafile orders.
<P>
The equations to scale by factors Sx and Sy are obtained from the general
equations (with M11 = Sx and M22 = Sy) and can be written:
<P>
<I>x'</I> =<I> xSx</I>
<P>
<I>y'</I> =<I> ySy</I>
<P>
A scaling transformation reduces or increases all the coordinates of an
object by the scaling factor. Any object not aligned on the x- and y-axes
is therefore moved nearer to the origin by a reduction in size, and away
from the origin by an increase in size. For example, if an application applies
a scaling factor of 0.5 to a simple box with its corners at (4,4), (10,4),
(10,10), and (4,10), the four corners moves to (2,2), (5,2), (5,5), and
(2,5).
<P>
To scale an object about a point without causing it to move, the following
sequence of transformations is required:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Translate the scaling point of the object to
the origin.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Scale the object at the origin.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Translate the scaling point of the object back
to its original position.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
