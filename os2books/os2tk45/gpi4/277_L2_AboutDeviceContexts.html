<H1>About Device Contexts</H1><!-- entering slot 290 -->
<P>
Device contexts link presentation spaces to devices by converting device-independent
presentation space information into device-dependent information. This conversion
occurs in the<I> presentation driver</I>, a low-level program that is transparent
to the application. A presentation driver is device-driver code that converts
the application commands into output commands specific for each output device.

<P>
After creating a device context, it must be associated with a presentation
space before the drawing (or primitives) can be printed or displayed. When
a presentation space and a device context are associated with each other,
any output you direct to the presentation space is directed automatically
at the device context and displayed on the physical device. For example,
before you can draw a picture in a display window, the picture's graphics
presentation space must be associated with the window's device context.

<P>
Device contexts also give applications access to important device information
such as screen dimensions or printer capabilities.
<P>
As with presentation spaces, there are three types of device contexts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
