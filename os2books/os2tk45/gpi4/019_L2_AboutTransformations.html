<H1>About Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
The coordinate spaces are connected by different transformation functions.
In reality, the input coordinates of the world coordinate space are transformed
directly into device coordinates in a single operation. The intermediate
coordinate spaces exist only to provide a useful model to assist in the
understanding of how to define the different transformation matrixes.
<P>
Transformation of graphic primitives occur when a transformation matrix
is applied to those primitives. The individual transformations introduced
here do not actually transform the primitives, but rather define portions
of the transformation matrix. After all portions of the matrix are identified,
the actual operation is performed in a single step.
<P>
The transformation functions manipulate graphics primitives as they move
from one coordinate space to the next. Transformation functions usually
begin with the letters<I> Gpi</I>. Most of the function names have a<I> transformation
type</I> that identifies the entities on which it operates. For example,
a model transformation is the transformation type that transforms graphics
primitives between a world coordinate space and a model space. There is
a 1-to-1 correspondence between these transformation types and the actual
functions. The transformation matrix data structure is called<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 FC --> MATRIXLF</A>.

<P>
The following figure lists the sequence of coordinate spaces and the transformation
types between the coordinate spaces. Internally, all transformations are
combined, and the resulting values are held in the same format as the individual
components. By default, there is no viewing window and no graphics field.
The application can use the default page viewport. Clipping regions for
each coordinate space are also shown.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="019_L2_AboutTransformations_6.gif" WIDTH=572 HEIGHT=760>
