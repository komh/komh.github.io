<P>
A memory metafile is deleted by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 7D C3 FC --> GpiDeleteMetaFile</A>.
After the operation is complete, the handle to the metafile no longer points
to a usable object. A disk file containing the metafile remains untouched
by this operation. A disk metafile is deleted by using operating system
commands that delete any other type of file.
