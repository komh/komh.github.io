<P>
Simple drawing applications use line and arc primitives as drawing tools.
They are useful, for example, in spreadsheet applications for constructing
pie charts, bar charts, and graphs.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="146_L2_AboutLineandArcPrimi_28.gif" WIDTH=613 HEIGHT=638>

Following are more illustrations that were drawn using line and arc primitives.

Computer-aided-design (CAD) applications combine line and arc primitives
to draw such complex pictures as schematic diagrams for electrical wiring,
blueprints for building sites, and cross-sectional views of machinery.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="146_L2_AboutLineandArcPrimi_30.gif" WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=364>

Line and arc primitives are actually two families of primitives that contain
many variations of straight lines and curved lines, respectively. They are
presented together in this chapter because all the variations are governed
by the attributes found in the data structure LINEBUNDLE.
<P>
An application draws the line and arc primitives by first calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 3E --> GpiMove
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 FC --> GpiSetCurrentPosition</A>,
either of which sets the current position to a specified starting point.
<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 3E -->GpiMove</A> ignores the AM_PRESERVE
mode, whereas<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 41 --> GpiSetCurrentPosition
</A>saves the current position if the AM_PRESERVE mode is set. The more
sophisticated function,<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C3 FC --> GpiPolyLineDisjoint</A>,
contains its own starting point and does not need to be preceded by<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> GpiMove</A>,
or<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 FC --> GpiSetCurrentPosition</A>.
<P>
Prior to calling a line or arc function, the current position can be determined
with<A><!-- external link: 1D D1 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCurrentPosition</A>.
