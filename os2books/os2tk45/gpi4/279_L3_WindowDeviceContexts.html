<P>
<I>Window device contexts</I> are a special type, in that they are the only
device contexts obtained with WinOpenWindowDC. As their name implies, the
output device they represent is a display window. WinOpenWindowDC accepts
a window handle as input and returns the window device context handle. The
window device context handle can then be associated with a standard micro
presentation space or a normal presentation space.
<P>
The window device context is closed automatically when its associated window
is deleted.
