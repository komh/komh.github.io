<P>
The match value of any device font is guaranteed to be unique only for the
current device. If you associate the presentation space with a different
device context, any logical fonts that also are device fonts are no longer
available. On the new device, the match number could identify a different
device font (which may not be suitable) or no font at all. Therefore, you
should redefine a logical font and select it as the current font if you
reassociate the presentation space when the current font is a device font.
Otherwise, the default font is used.
<P>
If you do not intend to use the font on the new device, however, you need
not redefine it. You will be able to continue using the font if you reassociate
the presentation space with the original device context.
<P>
Any generic fonts can continue to be used after the presentation space is
reassociated if they are suitable for the new device. An image font, for
example, can be used only on devices that are all-points addressable.
