<H1>Line Width and Geometric Width for Paths</H1><!-- entering slot 302 -->
<P>
<I>Cosmetic</I> lines represent the mathematical ideal of a one-dimensional
line. The width attribute associated with them is provided only for ease
of drawing these lines larger than one pel.
<P>
In contrast,<I> geometric</I> line width is not an attribute; it is a geometric
property. To set the width of a geometric line, an application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 44 C4 FC --> GpiSetLineWidthGeom</A>.
This geometric width takes effect only when a path is converted to a geometric
wide line using<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 38 --> GpiStrokePath</A> or
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC -->GpiModifyPath</A>.
<P>
If a geometric line is drawn before the geometric width is specified, the
drawn line is defined by the cosmetic line width-usually 1-which results
in the thinnest possible line for the currently associated device. A geometric
line width has no default in the same way that the sides of a box, drawn
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 FC --> GpiBox</A>, have no length until
specified by the function.
<P>
The value specified with<A><!-- external link: 1D 44 C4 37 --> GpiSetLineWidthGeom
</A>is the thickness of the line in world coordinates, and it is subject
to scaling by the current transformations in effect at the time<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 35 --> GpiModifyPath
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 38 --> GpiStrokePath</A> is called.
For example, if you apply a transform with a scaling factor of 0.5, for
an object whose current geometric line width is four world coordinates,
the width of the displayed line will be halved.
<P>
In the floor plan shown in the following figure, the outer walls were drawn
using geometric lines.  All of the other objects were drawn using normal
lines.

Your application can determine the current geometric width by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D ED C3 FC --> GpiQueryLineWidthGeom</A>.
