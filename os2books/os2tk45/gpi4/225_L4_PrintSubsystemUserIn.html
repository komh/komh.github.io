<H1>Print Subsystem User Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 235 -->
<P>
The print subsystem user interface is composed of printer objects. The spooler
implements each printer object by using a queue to hold the jobs. The queue
is connected to a logical device that specifies configuration data about
the actual physical device, for example, the port and printer drivers.
<P>
The print subsystem user interface performs the following basic functions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Print job status</B>
<P>
Opening a printer object folder displays an icon or detail view of the print
jobs waiting in the spooler queue. Opening the settings on an individual
job displays the parameters that were used when the job was queued. Some
settings, such as the number of copies, can be changed while the print job
is waiting in the queue.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Print job manipulation</B>
<P>
Individual print jobs can be held in or released from the queue.<I> Holding
</I>a print job means that it is not printed. Individual or all the print
jobs in a queue can be deleted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Queue manipulation</B>
<P>
Queues also can be held, released, deleted, copied, or created using the
printer object context menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Printer object configuration</B>
<P>
Opening a printer object settings notebook enables a user to browse and
modify the configuration of a printer object. For example, the printer driver
can be changed if the user just obtained new printer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
