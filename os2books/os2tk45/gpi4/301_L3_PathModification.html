<H1>Path Modification</H1><!-- entering slot 314 -->
<P>
To convert the current path to one that describes the envelope of a geometric
wide line, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> GpiModifyPath</A>.
The current geometric line attributes are then applied to the figures within
the path. The line end, line join, and geometric line width attributes all
must be set before modify-path or stroke-path operations begin, because
it is during those times that the attributes are applied. Cosmetic line
attributes of width and type have no effect on geometric lines.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 49 -->GpiModifyPath</A> accepts the path
identifier (which must be 1) and the modification option MPATH_STROKE as
input.
<P>
Subsequently, the modified path can be filled to display the geometric wide
line, but only in winding mode. Alternatively, the modified path can be
converted into a clip path, but again, only in winding mode.
<P>
Open figures within the path are not closed automatically. Figures not explicitly
closed with<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 47 --> GpiCloseFigure</A> are
drawn with line ends rather than line joins at their start and end points.
If the figures within the path overlap, the geometric width envelope compensates
so that the overlap portion is not drawn blank in XOR or exclusive-OR mode.

<P>
Now the geometric lines can be scaled.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The current transforms are applied to the primitives inside
a path bracket when the path is defined. This binds the path definition
in device coordinates at that time. The path is unaffected by subsequent
transformations, except for those (such as scaling) that affect the<I> width
</I>of geometric (wide) lines. Since the geometric line width attribute
is not applied until the path is converted into a wide line by<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 49 --> GpiModifyPath
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 FC --> GpiStrokePath</A>, the width
of geometric lines is unaffected by earlier transformations directed at
the path definition.
<P>
After creating a path bracket, geometric wide lines can be constructed by
either:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Stroking the path (<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 4A -->GpiStrokePath</A>),
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Modifying the path (<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 49 -->GpiModifyPath</A>),
then filling the path (<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 48 -->GpiFillPath</A>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 4A -->GpiStrokePath</A> is slightly more
efficient, but<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 49 --> GpiModifyPath</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 48 -->GpiFillPath</A> offer more flexibility
(by way of the fill options). After drawing the lines no alterations can
be made.
