<H1>The Propagate-Visibility Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 90 -->
<P>
This attribute controls whether the visibility attribute of a calling segment
is inherited by any segments called from it. The propagate-visibility attribute
is set ON by default. This value overrides the visibility setting of the
called segment. For example, if the visibility attribute of a calling segment
is set to OFF, all segments called from it are invisible, regardless of
how they have been defined.
