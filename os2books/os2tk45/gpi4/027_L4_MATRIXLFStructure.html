<H1>MATRIXLF Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 28 -->
<P>
Of the nine fields in MATRIXLF, four are special 32-bit FIXED variables.
The remaining five are 32-bit long integer variables.
<P>
The scaling, reflecting, and rotation constants, M11,M12,M21,M22, are the
32-bit, signed, FIXED variables, with an implied binary point between the
second and third bytes. The translation constants, M31 and M32, and the
three third-column variables, are 32-bit long integers.
<P>
A FIXED variable is a binary representation of a floating-point number.
A FIXED variable has two parts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The high-order 16-bits, which contain a signed integer
in the range -32768 through 32767.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The low-order 16-bits, which contain the numerator
of a fraction in the range 0 through 65535.
<P>
The denominator for this fraction is 65536.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example, to store the cosine of 60Â° (0.5) in a FIXED variable, an application
would multiply 65536 by 0.5. The result, 32768, would be the value to assign
to a field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 40 --> MATRIXLF</A> structure.

<P>
To store a scaling factor of 3 in a FIXED variable, the application would
multiply 65536 by 3. Again, the result, 196608, would be the value to assign
to a field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 40 --> MATRIXLF</A> structure.

<P>
