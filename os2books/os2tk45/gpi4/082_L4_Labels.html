<H1>Labels</H1><!-- entering slot 83 -->
<P>
You can include<I> labels</I> in a segment to make locating particular elements
of the segment easier. If you label an element that is likely to be edited,
you can access that element when necessary, regardless of whether the actual
position of the label-element pair within the segment has changed.
<P>

<P>
<B>Warning:</B> When editing segments, do not inadvertently insert elements
between a label and the element that follows. Your application will no longer
be able to use certain GPIs correctly because their default locations and
offsets will be invalid.
<P>

<P>
A label is only a place-holder or reference point, and is itself an element
of the segment. Labels are long integer values. To include a label in a
segment, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C3 FC --> GpiLabel</A>. The following
example includes the label 5 in the current segment, whose segment id is
4.
<PRE>GpiOpenSegment(hps, 4L);
GpiLabel(hps, 5L);
 .
 .
 .
</PRE>
Your application can set the element pointer to the label position using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 3D C4 FC -->GpiSetElementPointerAtLabel</A>, then
increment the pointer position to the element itself using<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 3A --> GpiOffsetElementPointer
</A>with an offset of 1.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This example of GPI cannot work properly if your application
has allowed the insertion of elements between a label and the element that
follows it.
<P>
Labels do not have to be unique. If you do not use unique labels,<A><!-- external link: 1D 3D C4 3F --> GpiSetElementPointerAtLabel
</A>positions the element pointer at the first occurrence of the label,
starting from the current pointer position. If the label is not found between
the current pointer position and the end of the segment, an error condition
is raised. Using labels as a navigation aid might be quicker than scanning
the segment for a particular element.
<P>
If you do not use labels, you must locate an element before you can change
it. To locate a specific element in a segment, you must repeatedly move
the element pointer using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3C C4 3E --> GpiSetElementPointer
</A>then read the contents of the element using<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> GpiQueryElement</A>.
This can be quite a lengthy procedure depending upon the number of elements
in the segment.
