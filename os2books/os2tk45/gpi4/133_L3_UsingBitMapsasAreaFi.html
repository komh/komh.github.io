<H1>Using Bit Maps as Area-Fill Patterns</H1><!-- entering slot 138 -->
<P>
An alternative to using the Font Editor to create your own pattern sets
is to use a bit map as an area-fill pattern. You must call GpiSetBitmapId
to give the bit map an lcid, and then call<A><!-- external link: 1D 4F C4 FC --> GpiSetPatternSet</A>,
specifying the lcid of the bit map. The bit map becomes a pattern set containing
one pattern, and the current pattern-symbol attribute is ignored.<A><!-- external link: 1D BD C3 34 --> GpiQueryBitmapHandle
</A>returns the handle of the bit map currently known by the lcid that you
supply as input.
<P>
PM cannot distinguish among the lcids associated with a particular presentation
space. Any lcid can identify a character set, marker set, pattern set, or
bit map (that is being used as an area-fill pattern). For example, if you
call<A><!-- external link: 1D F8 C3 35 --> GpiQueryNumberSetIds</A> to determine
how many lcids are currently assigned in the presentation space, the number
returned to you includes all logical fonts defined for this presentation
space. You also can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 81 C3 33 --> GpiDeleteSetId
</A>to remove lcids associated with the non-font entities. If you call this
function to delete a bit map that is being used as an area-fill pattern,
the bit map itself is not deleted. However, it is disassociated from its
lcid, and the lcid can be reused.
