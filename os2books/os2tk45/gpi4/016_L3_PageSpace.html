<P>
The page space is where a complete picture is assembled for viewing on a
display screen, or for printing or plotting on a piece of paper. Page coordinate
units can be increments of an inch, a meter, pels, or some arbitrary value.
An application uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 29 --> GpiCreatePS</A> to
specify the units used for page coordinates.
<P>
If the application uses retained-drawing mode, the picture in page space
contains parts of models (or pictures) from each of the model spaces that
have not been clipped. The picture also contains any additional unclipped
graphics-primitive output that the application generated in nonretained-drawing
mode. If the application uses nonretained-drawing mode, the picture in page
space contains all the graphics-primitive output that has not been clipped.

<P>
In the page space, an application can use a rectangular clipping area called
a<I> graphics field</I> to define the part of the page space to place in
the next coordinate space (the device space). The coordinates that define
the location and dimensions of the graphics field are always page coordinates.

<P>
The page space contains the presentation page whose size and units are defined
when creating the presentation space with<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC --> GpiCreatePS</A>.
The presentation page is a rectangle in page space.
