<H1>Creating Marker Sets and Pattern Sets</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
Like character sets, marker sets and pattern sets are defined in fonts.
For both marker sets and pattern sets, there are system-provided defaults.
You also can create your own image markers or patterns, but not outline
markers or patterns, using the Font Editor. The font definition containing
the image or pattern can be loaded either as a public font (using the<B> Install
</B>selection from the Control Panel) or as a private font (using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 FC --> GpiLoadFonts</A>).
The current character mode has no effect on marker sets and pattern sets.
Any character from a font can be used as a marker or as an area-fill pattern.

<P>
Before you can use a locally defined marker set or pattern set, you must
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 34 --> GpiCreateLogFont</A> to define
a logical font and to give it an lcid, just as you would for a character
font. Most of the values you can specify with<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 34 --> GpiCreateLogFont
</A>are not applicable to marker sets and pattern sets. Furthermore, in
the instance of marker sets and pattern sets, you usually know that you
want to use a particular font.
<P>
To select a locally defined marker set or pattern set:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 36 --> GpiQueryFonts
</A>to obtain a match value for the font.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogFont</A>,
specifying the face name, match value, and lcid for the font.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select the logical font as the current marker
set or pattern set by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 47 C4 37 --> GpiSetMarkerSet
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 4F C4 FC --> GpiSetPatternSet</A>, as appropriate.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To revert to using the default pattern or marker sets, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 4F C4 38 --> GpiSetPatternSet
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 47 C4 37 --> GpiSetMarkerSet</A> with the
value LCID_DEFAULT.
