<H1>Default Viewing Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
The default viewing window is the same size as the model space. Therefore,
to display one or more entire model spaces, draw the picture the required
number of times and let the viewing window default each time.
<P>
Default viewing transformations scroll or zoom pictures in a window on a
display screen. An application can determine the current values for the
default viewing transformation by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D4 C3 FC --> GpiQueryDefaultViewMatrix</A>,
which returns the default-viewing-transformation values in a one-dimensional
array representing elements in<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 4B --> MATRIXLF
</A>structure. The application can set these values by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 36 C4 3C --> GpiSetDefaultViewMatrix
</A>and passing the transformation values in a one-dimensional array representing
elements in<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C4 4B --> MATRIXLF</A> structure.

<P>
A default viewing transformation is applied when the screen contents are
zoomed or scrolled by user interaction. A picture is zoomed when the user
wants to increase or decrease the size of an area of interest. A picture
is usually scrolled when there is more in the presentation page than can
be displayed in a single page of output. Anything lying off the screen,
but within the range of the presentation page, can be scrolled into view.
The default viewing transformation applies to the entire page coordinate
space, and can be added to, or can replace, the current default viewing
transformation. The PM applies it after any viewing transformations.
<P>
When a presentation page is created, the default viewing transformation
is set to identity. For example, if the presentation-page contents are scrolled:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Erase the screen contents.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 36 C4 3C --> GpiSetDefaultViewMatrix
</A>to translate the presentation-page picture by the required amount.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Draw the picture again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following figure shows the airplane presentation-page contents scrolled
to the left.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="060_L4_DefaultViewingTransf_20.gif" WIDTH=496 HEIGHT=423>
<P>
Scrolling the Presentation Page
<P>
Every presentation-page coordinate is translated to the left by the same
amount.
<P>

<P>
Zooming is implemented in the same way, except that the default viewing
transformation is used to scale the picture up or down as required.
<P>
If you want to display only one view of a single picture, and if you do
not want scrolling and zooming capabilities, you can let the viewing and
default viewing transformations default. When both transformations are permitted
to default, page coordinate space is effectively the same as model space.
