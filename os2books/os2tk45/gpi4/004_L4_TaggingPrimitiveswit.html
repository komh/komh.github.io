<H1>Tagging Primitives within a Segment</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 59 C4 4A -->GpiSetTag</A> inserts a long integer
value, called a<I> tag</I>, at the current element pointer position. The
tag becomes a segment element, which serves as an identifier for the primitives
that follow until the next tag is issued. Tags also are called<I> pick tags
</I>or<I> pick identifiers</I>. Typically, applications assign tags only
to elements that correspond to primitives. You can determine the value of
the last tag assigned to an element using<A><!-- external link: 1D 0D C4 FC --> GpiQueryTag</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Tags are used only in correlation. They are not used in the
chaining or calling of segments, nor do they cause or modify output.
<P>
The long integer value of the tag is<I> 0</I> by default. However, a 0 value
makes the subsequent primitives undetectable. An application can use this
effect to make some parts of a segment detectable and other parts of it
non-detectable. If you know that this capability is unnecessary, you can
change the default tag value using<A><!-- external link: 1D 37 C4 FC --> GpiSetDefTag</A>.

<P>
The tag you specify becomes the current tag, and it applies to all subsequent
primitives until you next call<A><!-- external link: 1D 59 C4 FC --> GpiSetTag</A>.
The tag can be considered one of the attributes of the primitive and therefore
affected by the current attribute mode. In AM_PRESERVE mode, it is stored
on the LIFO stack and can be recalled with<A><!-- external link: 1D B2 C3 FC --> GpiPop</A>.
Tags cannot be inserted between a<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 45 --> GpiBeginArea
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 46 --> GpiEndArea</A> area bracket.
All primitives within an area have the same tag.
<P>
A tag value greater than 0 enables correlation on the subsequent primitives,
but only if the segment ID is greater than 0 as well. The data returned
from each correlation consists of a set of segment-tag pairs. The reason
for this pairing is that a single segment can draw objects in several locations.
By adding identifiers within the segment, an application has a more exact
description of what has intersected the pick aperture.
<P>
For simple chained segments, each unique segment-tag pair within the pick
aperture is known as a<I> hit</I>. If two or more primitives in the pick
aperture have the same tag, they are considered a single hit. Hits for called
segments differ slightly and are described in <A HREF="009_L5_ThelMaxDepthInputPar.html">The
lMaxDepth Input Parameter</A>.
