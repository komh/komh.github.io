<H1>Converting a Region to a Clip Region</H1><!-- entering slot 332 -->
<P>
Clipping is the process an application uses to limit graphics output to
a specific area (called the clipping area) of the display or page.
<P>
There are several clipping functions provided by the PM. However, if your
application requires a clipping boundary in device coordinates, it must
define the boundary with a region. To convert the region into a clipping
boundary, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A>.
The clip region, as defined by this operation, becomes the current clip
region of all subsequent drawing operations.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 52 -->GpiSetClipRegion</A> accepts, as input,
the region handle. A NULL region handle sets the clip region to infinity,
effectively performing no clipping.
<P>
Unlike clip paths, the region that is no longer the current clip region
is not deleted. It retains the effects of any changes made to it while it
was a clip region, and it can be used with the other region functions, including
being reselected as the clip region with<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A>.

<P>
You do not have to deselect the current clip region before selecting another.
Each selected clip region automatically replaces the one before it. If there
is an existing clip region when you call<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A>,
it reverts to a normal region, and its handle is returned.
<P>
When you have selected the current clip region, none of the region functions
described thus far can be used for that region. The following functions
can be used with the current clip region:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiQueryClipBox<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiIntersectClipRectangle<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiExcludeClipRectangle<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiOffsetClipRegion<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiPtVisible<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GpiRectVisible<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These functions are described in<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C5 2B --> Clipping
and Boundary Determination</A>. All of these functions work in world coordinates,
rather than device coordinates, and therefore, are subject to current transformations.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D B4 C3 4F -->GpiPtVisible</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 14 C4 51 --> GpiRectVisible
</A>do not apply exclusively to clip regions.
<P>
When the screen contents are altered (for example, when a window is sized),
you have to be able to repair the part of the screen image affected by the
change. The following figure illustrates the necessary region.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="319_L4_ConvertingaRegiontoa_80.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=162>
<P>
Repairing the Screen with Clip Regions
<P>

<P>
To improve performance of the drawing operation, you can restrict the redrawing
and repair work to the affected parts of the screen.
<P>
Use WinQueryUpdateRegion to determine whether graphics objects are totally
outside the update region and need not be drawn at all. Graphics objects
that are within, or are partly outside, the update region should be drawn,
and the system will perform the required clipping automatically.
<P>
Define a clipping region using the dimensions of the update region. Then
call an appropriate GPI drawing request, such as<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 FC --> GpiDrawChain</A>,
to redraw the screen contents. Any drawing that would occur outside the
clip region is discarded according to the standard clipping rules. Only
those graphics within the clip region are redrawn.
