<P>
The average character width of a font is the average character increment
in world coordinates. The character increment is the sum of the a-space,
b-space, and c-space of a character. If you are setting the font-use indicator
FATTR_FONTUSE_OUTLINE, you can set the average character width to 0 because
the outline fonts take an equivalent value from the character cell attribute
that is current when text is written to an output device.
