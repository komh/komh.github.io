<P>
Like areas and paths, not all functions and attributes can be represented
in a metafile. Metafile content is mainly dependent upon the drawing mode
in which the metafile is to be played. If the metafile is to be played when
the current drawing-mode parameter is DM_DRAW (and in no other drawing mode),
the metafile content is restricted as shown in <A HREF="191_L5_DrawModeRestrictions.html">Draw-Mode
Restrictions</A>. If the metafile is to be played when the current drawing-mode
parameter is DM_RETAIN or DM_DRAWANDRETAIN, or if the file is to conform
to SAA* guidelines, the metafile content is restricted as shown in <A HREF="192_L5_CreatingMetafilesfor.html">Creating
Metafiles for Interchange</A>.
