<P>
There are several stages involved in using the PM programming interface
to print your application data. From a user interface point of view, the
following four dialogs must be provided. The exact order in which these
dialogs are used will govern the order of program execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Page setup dialog</B>
<P>
The<I> page setup dialog</I> enables the user to specify the form name or
size required. Options on this dialog can include margins on the page, header
and footer strings, and whether duplex formatting is required.
<P>
The actual contents of the dialog depend on the type of application. The
important factor is that this page specify formatting options that also
are used to display to a screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Printer setup dialog</B>
<P>
The<I> printer setup dialog</I> displays a list of queues available to the
user. A<B> Job properties</B> push button on this dialog enables the user
to query and modify the job properties for this job.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Font dialog</B>
<P>
Most PM applications must enable the user to specify the font (or fonts)
required. Once the user has chosen a printer, an option on the fonts dialog
enables the user to choose from device fonts as well as system fonts.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Print dialog</B>
<P>
The application should have a Print menu item on the File menu to invoke
an application-specific print dialog. It is recommended that Shift+Print
Screen be used as an accelerator for printing the client area. The Print-Screen
key, unshifted, is used to capture and print a window or the whole screen.
