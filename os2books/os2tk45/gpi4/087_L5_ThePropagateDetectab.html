<H1>The Propagate-Detectability Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
This attribute controls whether the detectability attribute of a calling
segment is inherited by any segments called from it. The propagate-detectability
attribute is set ON by default. This value overrides the detectability setting
of the called segment. For example, if you set the detectability attribute
of a calling segment to OFF, all segments called from it are nondetectable,
regardless of how they have been defined.
