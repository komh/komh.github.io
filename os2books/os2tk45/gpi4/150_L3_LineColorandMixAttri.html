<H1>Line Color and Mix Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 157 -->
<P>
The color attribute defines the color used to draw a primitive or an object.
The mix attribute determines how the color of a primitive or an object is
combined with the color of the drawing surface, or any other objects on
the surface.
<P>
The line color defines the color used to draw the output from any of the
operating system's line functions. When a presentation space is created,
the line color initial default is black. Unlike certain other primitives,
the line and arc primitives do not have a background color. The current
color of the drawing surface automatically plays a greater role in the appearance
of line and arc primitives than in those primitives that do have a background
color. Specifically, when an application draws a dotted or dashed line,
the color that appears between the dots or dashes is the current drawing-surface
color, as shown in the following figure.
<P>
Line and arc primitives have only a color attribute for the actual line.
The mix attribute controls the combination of line color with drawing surface
color.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="150_L3_LineColorandMixAttri_32.gif" WIDTH=623 HEIGHT=536>

Line and Arc Primitives
<P>
When a presentation space is created, the line mix attribute initial default
is FM_OVERPAINT. The<I> overpaint</I> mix attribute specifies that the line
color is not modified by the color of the drawing surface. If the line mix
attribute is changed, the line color is mixed with colors that are already
on the drawing surface.
<P>
To specify a new color or mix attribute use<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 FC --> GpiSetAttrs</A>.
This function accepts as input the type of primitive, for example PRIM_LINE,
a list of attributes that are to be changed, a list of attributes that are
to be set to their default values, and the values for the attributes that
are to be changed.<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 4B --> GpiSetAttrs</A> is
useful for specifying colors and mix attributes just for a specific data
structure (for example, the LINEBUNDLE structure).<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 4B --> GpiSetAttrs
</A>also provides some protection against invalid colors.
<P>
To determine the current line color and mix attribute, use<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C3 FC --> GpiQueryAttrs</A>.
This function accepts as input the primitive type and the attributes in
question. It returns as output an array of values for the specifically queried
attributes.
<P>
To reset the default line color and mix attribute, just as with any other
attribute specified in the LINEBUNDLE data structure, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 35 C4 FC --> GpiSetDefAttrs</A>.
This function accepts as input the type of primitive, for example PRIM_LINE,
the attributes to be changed, and the values that will become the new default
values. The changing of default values is important when working with segments.
Changing the default values during a series of drawing functions is not
recommended.
<P>
The line color and mix attribute also can be specified with<A><!-- external link: 1D 31 C4 4C --> GpiSetColor
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 49 C4 FC --> GpiSetMix</A>, respectively.
However, those two functions have the disadvantage of specifying the color
and mix attribute for all primitive BUNDLE data structures that have a component
for foreground color and foreground mix attribute. The queries,<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 49 --> GpiQueryColor
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D F5 C3 FC --> GpiQueryMix</A>, determine
the color and mix attribute as specified by<A><!-- external link: 1D 31 C4 4C --> GpiSetColor
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 49 C4 FC --> GpiSetMix</A>. If the line
color or mix attribute is specified individually, the aforementioned queries
can return a value inconsistent with the current line color or mix attribute.
