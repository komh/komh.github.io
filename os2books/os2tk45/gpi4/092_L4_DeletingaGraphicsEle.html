<P>
When you remove an element from a segment, the element pointer addresses
the element immediately before the one you deleted. As with other editing
functions, the current drawing mode parameter must be DM_RETAIN when you
are deleting elements. The current editing mode (insert or replace) has
no effect on the delete functions.
