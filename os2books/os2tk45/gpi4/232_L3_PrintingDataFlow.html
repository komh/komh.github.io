<H1>Printing Data Flow</H1><!-- entering slot 242 -->
<P>
The data flow between your application, the printer driver, the spooler,
and the kernel device driver is shown in the following figure. In addition
to the data flow for the printer data stream, the data flow for screen output
is shown. From an application's point of view, creating output for a printer
is conceptually the same as creating screen output.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="232_L3_PrintingDataFlow_56.gif" WIDTH=604 HEIGHT=774>

Overview of the Application Interface and Data Flow
<P>

<P>
There are three routes that the application's printer data can follow:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Base Printing</B>
<P>
<I>Base printing</I> is provided primarily for non-PM programs writing complete
printer data streams, including all printer control codes, directly to a
printer port. It also provides compatibility for applications that run under
DOS or Microsoft** Windows**.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Queued PM Printing</B>
<P>
<I>Queued printing</I> is recommended for all PM programs. It provides the
most flexibility, both for the application and the user.
<P>
Print jobs created by PM applications are queued on a spooler queue. The
spool files are processed and finally sent to the printer asynchronously
from the application.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the spooler is disabled, queued print jobs perform as though
they were submitted for PM direct printing.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Direct PM Printing</B>
<P>
Conceptually,<I> direct printing</I> is the same as queued printing for
the application interface, but the spooler is bypassed. Therefore, the data
is sent directly to the printer, and the application has to wait until the
printing is finished. Following are some of the reasons for PM applications
to avoid direct printing:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The print job can interfere with other users whose
jobs are destined for this printer. Print output could be mixed with the
other print jobs<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The spooler allows only one job at a time to print
to a particular port to avoid mixing of print job output. If your application
tries to print directly to the same port while another job is printing,
your user must wait for the current job to complete before the user's job
can begin.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The printing application loses some of its multitasking
advantages because one job must complete before a second job is submitted.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The printer device driver does not protect a print
job from job property and printer property mismatches.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Pictures printed directly can be different from those
printed through a spooler. The default setting for direct printing is to
print pictures their actual size, whereas the default for queue printing
is<I> scaled to fit</I> for the output area.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Direct
printing is recommended only for specialized applications that use dedicated
hard copy devices. Print jobs that have a certain degree of security associated
with them, such as a corporate payroll or confidential documents, might
best be handled with direct printing because files in the spooler can be
copied.
<P>
Jobs that are very large, that is, over 10MB, that you do not want copied
in the spool file, also might best be printed directly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
