<P>
A partial arc is a section of a full arc defined by the current arc parameters.
To draw a partial arc, use<A><!-- external link: 1D A7 C3 FC --> GpiPartialArc</A>,
which draws two separate figures. The first figure is a straight line from
the current position to the starting point of a partial arc, and the second
figure is the partial arc itself. When the arc has been drawn, the new current
position is at the end point of the partial arc.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A7 C3 3F -->GpiPartialArc</A> accepts as input
the center of the current full arc, of which the partial arc is a part,
specified in world coordinates. You also can specify a multiplier value
to increase or decrease the size of the partial arc in relation to the current
full arc.
<P>
You also must specify two positive fixed values: a start angle and a sweep
angle. If the current full arc is a circle, the start angle is measured
counterclockwise from the x-axis of the circle. The intersection of the
start angle with the full arc, adjusted by the multiplier value, defines
the starting point of the partial arc.
<P>
The sweep angle continues the counterclockwise measurement, beginning where
the start angle left off. The intersection of the sweep angle with the full
arc, adjusted by the multiplier value, defines the partial arc.
<P>
If the current arc is not a circle, the start and sweep angle are skewed
to the same degree that the ellipse is a skewed circle. The following figure
shows how the partial arc is constructed.

The Partial Arc
<P>
A is the start angle; B, the sweep angle.  C is the center point; D, the
current position.  Arc.EF is the partial arc.  F is the new current position.
The inner circle in the previous figure is the arc defined by the current
arc parameters. A multiplier has been specified with<A><!-- external link: 1D A7 C3 FC --> GpiPartialArc</A>,
so the partial arc is based on the full arc described by the outer circle.
Point C is the center point specified on<A><!-- external link: 1D A7 C3 FC --> GpiPartialArc</A>.
Angle A is the start angle, and angle B is the sweep angle.<A><!-- external link: 1D A7 C3 3F --> GpiPartialArc
</A>therefore, draws a line from the current position (point D) to the start
of the partial arc (point E). It also draws arc EF. Point F is the new current
position. The arc is drawn counterclockwise because the current arc parameters
define a counterclockwise circle. You can join points F and D with<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 FC --> GpiLine</A>.
This line is drawn automatically if you define the partial arc within a
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 3C -->GpiBeginArea</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 3D --> GpiEndArea
</A>bracket.
