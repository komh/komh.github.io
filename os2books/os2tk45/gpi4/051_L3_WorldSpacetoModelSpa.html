<H1>World-Space to Model-Space Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->
<P>
The model transformation drawing attribute operates between world and model
space. This attribute can be updated by one of the three following transformation
functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 4A C4 FC -->GpiSetModelTransformMatrix
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 57 C4 FC -->GpiSetSegmentTransformMatrix
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C3 FC -->GpiCallSegmentMatrix
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the model transformation drawing attribute has never been updated, the
attribute defaults to the identity transformation. If the drawing attribute
has been updated, the<I> existing transformation</I> is the concatenation
of any instance, segment, or model transformations from the root segment
downwards. Each time a new segment is opened (using<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 FC --> GpiOpenSegment</A>),
the model transformation drawing attribute is reset to its default value.

<P>
The three transformations that operate between world space and model space
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Model transformations<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Segment
transformations<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Instance transformations<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The transformations that occur between world-coordinate and model spaces
depend on the drawing mode and the possible segment type of the drawing
primitive.
<P>
The drawing mode can be either nonretain or retain. Nonretain mode is also
called draw mode, as the graphics are immediately displayed. In retain mode,
the graphics orders are stored in chained and unchained segments. A series
of segments are shown in the following figure.

Segments
<P>
A model transformation effects objects in any of these segments. A segment
transformation affects the six chained segments, on the left and must be
issued before Root Segment 1 is accessed. An instance transformation can
be applied only to Segment B or Segment D and must be issued from Segment
A or Segment 2 or Segment C. The instance transformation is reset on return
to the calling segment.
