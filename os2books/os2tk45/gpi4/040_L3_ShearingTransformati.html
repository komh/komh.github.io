<H1>Shearing Transformations</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
There are two shear transformations:  vertical and horizontal. The vertical
shear transformation affects only the y-component of the coordinates of
points in an object, and the horizontal shear transformation affects only
the x-component.
<P>
If an application shears an object that contains two orthogonal vectors
(two perpendicular lines), the vectors are no longer orthogonal.
<P>
A shearing transformation alters the shape of an object by translating its
x-coordinates relative to its y-coordinates, or its y-coordinates relative
to its x-coordinates. The amount by which the coordinates are translated
is determined by the angle of the shear.
<P>
The equation for shearing an object to the left along the x axis by angle
(theta) is:
<P>
<I>x'</I> =<I> x</I> -<I> y</I> tan (theta)
<P>
<I>y'</I> =<I> y</I>
<P>
To shear an object along the y-axis, the tangent of the angle of the shear
is represented by constant<I> B</I> in the general equation.
