<H1>Path Conversion to Region</H1><!-- entering slot 317 -->
<P>
To convert the current path to a region, use<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C3 FC --> GpiPathToRegion</A>.
Then the new region can be modified using any of the region functions that
allow the creation of irregular shaped regions.
<P>
Any open figures in the path definition are closed automatically by<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C3 FC --> GpiPathToRegion</A>.
Upon conversion, the current path definition is discarded just like it is
when being converted to a clip path. When<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C3 27 --> GpiPathToRegion
</A>is complete, the path definition is deleted automatically.
<P>
This function accepts the path identifier (which must be 1) and one of two
construction options as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->FPATH_ALTERNATE (default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->FPATH_WINDING (must be selected if the path has been
modified)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
