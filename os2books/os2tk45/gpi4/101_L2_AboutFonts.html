<P>
A<I> font family</I> is a collection of fonts that share common design characteristics
such as stroke width and serif.<I> Stroke width</I> refers to the width
of lines used to draw the characters and symbols of a font. A<I> serif</I> is
a short cross-line drawn at the ends of the main strokes forming a character
or symbol.
<P>
Text output is drawn with the characters and symbols of a font. The operating
system stores fonts either in memory or on devices. Applications can access
fonts through a device context associated with the current presentation
space. When an application creates a presentation space, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 48 --> GpiCreatePS
</A>or WinGetPS, the operating system assigns the presentation space a default
font from one of the available fonts. An application can retrieve information
about the default font using<A><!-- external link: 1D E3 C3 FC --> GpiQueryFontMetrics</A>.
