<H1>Availability of Additional Fonts</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
Over 600 Adobe Type 1 fonts are available from font vendors, and user systems
could have a large number of these installed. Applications must be capable
of functioning properly with whatever font the user selects.
<P>
An application can examine the font metrics to see what a font looks like
or display different font characters from which the user can choose. When
dealing with an interactive or user-driven application, the recommended
method of choosing a font is to call WinFontDlg, which displays an example
of the font in a dialog box.
<P>
Additional Adobe Type 1 fonts can be used just like other outline fonts.
Notice, however, that some of those fonts are more<I> stylized</I>; that
is, the fonts have a greater variation in the widths of different characters
within the same font, which is provided by<I> kerning</I>.
<P>
Adobe Type 1 fonts, provided with and for a particular application, can
be loaded with<A><!-- external link: 1D 9B C3 FC --> GpiLoadFonts</A>, provided
that the following rules are observed:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The .PFB file must be in the same directory as the
.AFM file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
