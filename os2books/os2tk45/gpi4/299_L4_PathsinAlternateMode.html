<H1>Paths in Alternate Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
For paths drawn in alternate mode (as with area primitives), the following
is true:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you have to cross an odd number of boundaries in
the path when drawing an imaginary line parallel to the x-axis, a point
is included in the filled path from that point to positive infinity.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you have to cross an even number of boundaries
in the path when drawing an imaginary line parallel to the x-axis, a point
is not included in the filled path from that point to positive infinity.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following figure shows how the operating system determines the filled
portion for the path shown in the previous figure. The path outside the
triangle, but inside the rectangle, is filled, because the imaginary lines
drawn from those points in the positive x-direction intersect the path boundaries
an odd number of times.

Calculating Filled Paths Constructed in Alternate Mode
<P>
Parts of the path with odd tallys are filled; parts with even tallys are
not filled.
