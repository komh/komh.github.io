<P>
In general, graphics defined in device coordinates (bit maps and image primitives)
cannot be transformed. For example, the size of an image primitive is specified
in device coordinates, and cannot be altered. The size, therefore, remains
unaltered down the viewing pipeline. The position of an image primitive,
however, is specified in world coordinates. The image is therefore subject
to translation transformations. Note, however, that<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 38 --> GpiWCBitBlt
</A>permits the target rectangle to be specified in world coordinates, which
are transformed.
<P>
Because the position of the image primitive is specified in world coordinates
and its width is specified in device coordinates, positioning two images
together on the screen causes special difficulties. The second image cannot
be positioned without knowing the width, in world coordinates, of the first
image. To get the width of the first image:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Identify two coordinate positions, one on the
image's left edge, and one on its right edge. For example, the two positions
could be (10,80) and (150,80). These positions are in device coordinates.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Convert these device coordinates to world coordinates
using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 FC --> GpiConvert</A>.<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 37 --> GpiConvert
</A>converts an array of (x,y) coordinates that apply in one coordinate
space to their corresponding values in another coordinate space.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Subtract the lower x-coordinate from the higher
x-coordinate. In the above example, the width of the image is the difference
between the world-coordinate equivalents of 150 and 10.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When you have the width of the first image in world coordinates, you can
calculate the start position of the second image.
<P>
Paths, although defined in world coordinates, are device-dependent and are
bound in device coordinates when they are defined. Subsequent transformations
(other than the windowing-system transformation) have no effect on paths.
However, if a path is used to create a wide line, the width of the line
is scaled as required.
