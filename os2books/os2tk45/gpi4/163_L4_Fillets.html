<H1>Fillets</H1><!-- entering slot 171 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D AB C3 59 -->GpiPolyFillet</A> constructs a<I> fillet
</I>(a curved line) made up of one or more arcs, each of which touches a
different straight line. You specify the end points of these straight lines
with<A><!-- external link: 1D AB C3 FC --> GpiPolyFillet</A>. The lines
are not drawn but are used to construct the curve.
<P>
The fillet starts at the current position and finishes at the end point
of the last line. On the way from the start point to the end point, the
fillet is tangential to all intermediate lines at their<I> midpoints</I>.
When the fillet is drawn, the current position is at the end point of the
last construction line. The following figure is an example of how a fillet
is constructed.

The Fillet
<P>
The fillet starts at (2,6) and ends at (5,1).  The fillet is tangential
to the midpoints of the lines from (2,8) to (6,9), from (6,9) to (9,5),
and from (9,5) to (5,3).
<P>

<P>
When you supply only two points, the construction lines of the fillet are
drawn from the current position to the first point, and from the first point
to the second point. The fillet is drawn from the current position to the
second point, and is tangential to the construction lines at those same
points.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D AC C3 5A -->GpiPolyFilletSharp</A> creates a fillet
on a series of connected construction lines. The first fillet in the series
is built using two construction lines:  one drawn from the current position
to point 1 (the control point), and one drawn from point 1 to point 2 (the
end point). The fillet is drawn from the current position to the end point,
and is tangential to the two construction lines at those points.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D AC C3 5A -->GpiPolyFilletSharp</A> also accepts
as input a sharpness value.<I> Sharpness</I> is a measure of the distance
between the fillet and the control point. It is calculated as shown in the
following figure.
<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="163_L4_Fillets_47.gif" WIDTH=474 HEIGHT=467>
<P>
Fillet with Sharpness Specified
<P>
Point A is the current position, point B is the control point, and point
C is the end point. W is the midpoint of the notional line AC. D is the
point at which the fillet crosses the notional line WB.
<P>

<P>
The sharpness of the fillet is the value WD / DB. The line WD is 10 coordinate
units, and the line DB is 5 coordinate units; therefore the sharpness value
is 2. The sharpness value defines the type of arc. This is shown in the
following table.
<PRE>┌──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│A sharpness value of...       │Defines...                    │
├──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│Greater than 1.0              │A hyperbola                   │
├──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│Equal to 1.0                  │A parabola                    │
├──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│Less than 1.0                 │An ellipse                    │
└──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
Subsequent fillets start from the end point of the previous fillet, and
are constructed using the next two lines in the sequence in exactly the
same way. For each fillet you define one control point, one end point, and
one sharpness value. Upon completion, the current position is at the end
point of the final construction line in the sequence.
<P>
There might be discontinuity of gradient between multiple fillets drawn
with<A><!-- external link: 1D AC C3 FC --> GpiPolyFilletSharp</A>. To avoid
this, ensure that points B and C of one fillet are on the same construction
line as points A and B of the next fillet in the sequence. This concept
is illustrated in connection with the spline primitive in the figure that
follows the next figure. Discontinuity of gradient between fillets does
not occur when the fillets are drawn with<A><!-- external link: 1D AB C3 FC --> GpiPolyFillet</A>.
