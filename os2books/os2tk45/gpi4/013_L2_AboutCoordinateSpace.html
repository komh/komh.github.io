<H1>About Coordinate Spaces</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
Most of the GPI functions draw their output in a conceptual area called
the<I> world coordinate space</I>. If you picture the presentation space
as a blank canvas on which to draw, the world coordinate space is a Cartesian
grid that provides a reference of scale for what is being drawn.
<P>
The components of a picture defined in a world coordinate space are often
defined to a scale convenient only to that component. Applications also
can define each component, or<I> subpicture</I>, starting at the origin
(0,0). This enables applications to define the scale of a subpicture and
the location of the subpicture separately. The ability to define all subpictures
at the origin means there is not always 1-to-1 correspondence between a
presentation space and a world coordinate space. Frequently a separate world
coordinate space exists for every subpicture.
<P>
After subpictures are defined in the world coordinate space, they undergo
a process called transformation and then appear on an output device. If
an application has not specifically applied a transformation to its subpictures,
by default the PM applies the<I> identity transformation</I>, which, in
effect, makes no changes to the subpicture.
<P>
All graphics systems, not just the PM, use at least one coordinate space
to generate output. The simplest graphics systems use a single coordinate
space, whose points are the pels on the display. These are sometimes called
single-space systems.
<P>
The PM creates multiple coordinate spaces and uses transformations to move
subpictures between the coordinate spaces. The PM assembles the application's
graphic output in a process that can use up to five coordinate spaces, known
collectively as the<I> viewing pipeline</I>. The PM coordinate spaces are:

single-coordinate space, the following table lists the differences to expect
when using PM's multi-coordinate space.
