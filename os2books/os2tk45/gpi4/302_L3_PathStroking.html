<H1>Path-Stroking</H1><!-- entering slot 315 -->
<P>
To modify and fill the current path in a single operation, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 FC --> GpiStrokePath</A>.
Then the path is drawn immediately to the output device, with the current
geometric line attributes applied to the figures within the path. Certain
device drivers can use this function to optimize storage.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 5A -->GpiStrokePath</A> automatically fills
the path in winding mode with the current area pattern symbol. When<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 5A --> GpiStrokePath
</A>is complete, the path definition is deleted from the device context.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 5A -->GpiStrokePath</A> is subject to the
same constraints as functions that perform simple line modification:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The line end, line join, and geometric line width
attributes all must be set before stroke operations.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Cosmetic line attributes of width and type have no
effect.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any open figures within the path are not closed automatically.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If figures are not explicitly closed with<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 FC --> GpiCloseFigure</A>,
they are drawn with line ends rather than line joins at their start and
end points.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the figures within the path overlap, the geometric
width envelope compensates so that the overlap portion is not drawn blank
when drawn in XOR (exclusive-OR) mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This function accepts as input both the path identifier (which must be 1)
and the stroke option (which must be 0L).
<P>
When the operating system strokes a path, it draws a geometric line of specified
width along the original figure that defined the path and then fills the
wide line. If the original figure is not a closed shape, the operating system
does not automatically close it before filling the path. The following figure
shows the effects of<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 5A --> GpiStrokePath
</A>on a box originally defined with normal (cosmetic) lines.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="302_L3_PathStroking_75.gif" WIDTH=608 HEIGHT=546>
<P>
Defining Lines with a Geometric Width
<P>
The broken line is the figure defined within the path. The solid lines show
the path after it has been converted. Each line has a geometric width of
<I>n</I> coordinate units, and the line joins have been defined as beveled.

<P>

<P>
After setting these attributes, the application can draw the line with<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 FC --> GpiStrokePath</A>.
After the lines are drawn, an application can scale stroked paths with a
scaling transformation.
<P>
As an alternative to the<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 FC --> GpiStrokePath</A>,
you can convert the path using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> GpiModifyPath</A>,
which does not draw the path on the current output device. To draw a modified
path, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> GpiFillPath</A>, which draws
the path and fills it with the current area-fill pattern in winding mode.
A modified path cannot be filled in alternate mode.
<P>
On some devices, it might be that the<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C4 5A --> GpiStrokePath
</A>method works better than<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> GpiModifyPath</A>,
followed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> GpiFillPath</A>.
