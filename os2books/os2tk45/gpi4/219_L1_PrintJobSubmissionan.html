<P>
The print subsystem of the OS/2 operating system provides a flexible, high-level
interface between your application and an output device. Because most of
the internal workings of the subsystem are shielded from both user and programmer,
this chapter concentrates on the programming process required to produce
hard copy output. Querying of printer resources, working under a specific
user's environment, designing for application-specific requirements, and
manipulation of print jobs also are described.
