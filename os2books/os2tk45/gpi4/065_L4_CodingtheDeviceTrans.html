<H1>Coding the Device Transformation</H1><!-- entering slot 66 -->
<P>
The PM automatically transforms the presentation-page contents to the area
of the device space within the page viewport. The drawing is not clipped
to the page viewport because this is a scaling transformation only. The
entire picture is displayed, regardless of the size of the page viewport
specified. The following figure shows the airplane presentation-page contents
scaled to fit the page viewport.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="065_L4_CodingtheDeviceTrans_22.gif" WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=357>

Device Space
<P>
A page viewport smaller than the presentation page has been defined. The
picture assembled in the presentation page is therefore scaled to fit the
page viewport.
<P>

<P>
After transformation to device space, graphics coordinates must be in the
range -32768 through +32767, even if the presentation page is defined in
GPIF_LONG format. An attempt to address a coordinate outside this range
results in a coordinate-overflow error. To determine if a graphics object
will give an error, applications can do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the application is not rotating or shearing a graphics
object, it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 46 --> GpiConvert</A> to
convert the device-space limits to world-coordinate-space limits, then uses
these limits when creating the graphics object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the application is rotating or shearing a graphics
object, it uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 46 --> GpiConvert</A> to
convert the device-space limits back to model space, and ensures that the
picture boundary is inside these limits. Note that this method only applies
if all rotational and shearing is performed using 1 of the model transformation
types.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Remember that world-coordinate space has its own own limits:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>32768 through +32767 for a GPIF_SHORT-format presentation
page<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>134217728 through +134217727 for a GPIF_LONG-format
presentation page.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Although applications can specify a page viewport of any size, the presentation
page can be mapped only to an area equal to, or less than, the available
device space. If an application specifies a viewport larger than the available
device space, part of the presentation page contents are displayed outside
the visible device output area. To find out the dimensions of the page viewport
for the currently associated device, use<A><!-- external link: 1D F9 C3 FC --> GpiQueryPageViewport</A>.
Applications can store the dimensions of the current page viewport before
changing them, and restore them later.
