<UL>
<P>
<B>object</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Object associated with this media
control interface command.  The object can be one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Device type<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Device name<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Filename<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Alias<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ALIAS
devicealias</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies an alternate name for
the given device. If an alias is specified, it must be used in subsequent
references to avoid automatic open. Following are descriptions of what an
alias can be:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Any word that is not a keyword<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Any valid filename<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Any string of words enclosed in double quotes, for
example:
<PRE>"CD Player"
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>If a string is used, any leading and trailing blanks
are ignored and internal blanks are preserved. Uppercase and lowercase can
be used, but an alias is case insensitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> DOSQUEUE
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>If a device instance is opened with the DOSQUEUE
keyword specified, window handles that are passed in for the instance will
be treated as OS/2 Control Program queue handles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> READONLY
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Specifies that the file is to be opened in read-only
mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> SHAREABLE</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Initializes
the device as shareable. Specifying shareable makes the resources of the
device available to other device contexts.  If SHAREABLE is not specified
with OPEN, the resource will be exclusively acquired when the device is
opened.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> TYPE devicetype</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies
the compound device used to control a device element. As an alternative
to TYPE, an application can specify the name of a file to be opened. The
media control interface uses the file EA or extension associated with the
file to select the controlling device.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> WAIT</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
command is executed synchronously.  The function waits until the requested
action is complete before returning to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NOTIFY
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The command is executed asynchronously, allowing
control to be returned immediately to the application.  When the requested
action is complete, an<A><!-- external link: 1D 22 27 FC --> MM_MCINOTIFY
</A>message is sent to the application window procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
