<UL>
<P>
<B>groupname</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Refers to a group using a name
instead of a group ID. A value for this variable must be specified with
the MAKE keyword.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In use, the variable<B> groupname</B> is the same as an alias.
Although the ALIAS keyword is not used, all rules related to ALIAS apply
to the group name.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> MAKE</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies
creation of a group by tying several instances together. Once "grouped",
the instances can be controlled by the application with one command.
<P>
The MAKE keyword requires values for the variables<B> groupname</B> and
<B>(i1 i2 i3)</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
<B><LI>i1 i2 i3)</B><!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Refers to the device instances
that make up the group. Device instances can be identified using aliases,
device types, or filenames-the same identifiers used when the devices were
opened. A value for this variable must be specified with the MAKE keyword.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B>NOPIECEMEAL</B><!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Specifies
that the group is to be processed as a whole rather than as separate parts.
 If one instance becomes inactive, all instances become inactive. This keyword
is used only with MAKE.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> DELETE
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Terminates an existing group by disassociating
instances that formed the group.  No other keywords, except WAIT or NOTIFY,
can be used with DELETE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> WAIT</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
command is executed synchronously.  The function waits until the requested
action is complete before returning to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NOTIFY
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The command is executed asynchronously, allowing
control to be returned immediately to the application.  When the requested
action is complete, an<A><!-- external link: 1D 22 27 FC --> MM_MCINOTIFY
</A>message is sent to the application window procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
