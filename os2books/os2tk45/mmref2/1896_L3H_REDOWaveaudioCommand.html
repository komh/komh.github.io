<H1>REDO (Waveaudio Command) - Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 1898 -->
<P>
The REDO command redoes the last editing action (cut, paste, or delete)
which was undone with the <A HREF="1972_L3_UNDO.html">UNDO</A> command.
REDO should immediately follow <A HREF="1972_L3_UNDO.html">UNDO</A>; otherwise,
editing actions performed after <A HREF="1972_L3_UNDO.html">UNDO</A> (and
before a corresponding REDO) will be lost when the REDO command is issued.
The position of the media after a redo operation is 0.
<P>
Multiple REDO operations are permitted, corresponding to the number of editing
operations that have been previously undone with the <A HREF="1972_L3_UNDO.html">UNDO
</A>command.
