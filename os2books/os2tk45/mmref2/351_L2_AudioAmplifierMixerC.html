<H1>Audio Amplifier Mixer Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 351 -->
<P>
The audio amplifier mixer device supports extensions to the basic and required
command sets.  A device context of the audio amplifier mixer is a channel,
either stereo or monaural, so most commands apply to channel levels.  The
exception is commands that apply to the final (output) mix, such as master
volume.
<P>
Note that volume commands can be sent directly to player devices. These
devices forward the volume command to the connected audio amplifier mixer
channel device context when the output of the player is to an amplifier
mixer.  Other shaping functions, such as bass and treble, must be sent to
the amplifier mixer.
<P>
The ampmix device is a conduit of information and relies on another device
to provide the flow of information.  Therefore, commands for the transport
of information (such as play, seek, or stop), are sent to the attached device.
 Commands for transforming the information (such as treble or bass) are
sent directly to the ampmix device. If the application needs to talk directly
to the ampmix device, the value of the stream connector can be queried using
the <A HREF="015_L3_CONNECTION.html">CONNECTION</A> command, which returns
a device context connection.  An alias can be established for the connected
device.  Ampmix commands can then be sent directly to the ampmix device.

<P>
The ampmix device supports the device-type specific command, <A HREF="410_L3_MIXNOTIFY.html">MIXNOTIFY</A>,
and extensions to the following basic and required commands:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
