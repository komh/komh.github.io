<P>
If MMIO_SET_EXTENDEDINFO is set to associate a CODEC procedure with an open
file, the<I> pCODECIniFileInfo</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D BD 28 1D --> CODECASSOC
</A>structure is used to identify each CODEC procedure installed in the
initialization file.  As a result of the set, the CODEC procedures are opened
and each<I> pCodecOpen</I> structure is passed to its corresponding CODEC
procedure.
<P>
On query, two levels of information can be returned.  If MMIO_QUERY_EXTENDEDINFO_BASE
is set, only the<A><!-- external link: 1D 3D 29 47 --> MMEXTENDINFO</A> structure
is returned.  The<I> ulNumCODECs</I> is the number of currently associated
CODEC procedures.  The<I> ulBufSize</I> field is the buffer size for the
second level information.  If the application decides to query the second
level information, the MMIO_QUERY_EXTENDEDINFO_ALL flag must be set and
the<I> pUserExtendmminfo</I> parameter must point to a buffer with the size
equal to the<I> ulBufSize</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 3D 29 47 --> MMEXTENDINFO
</A>structure.
<P>
This function associates a CODEC procedure with an MMIO handle.  Typically,
this function is used to provide CODEC information for a new file being
created.  When an existing movie file is opened, any necessary CODEC procedures
are loaded by the I/O procedure automatically based on the compression type
and subtype specified in the file's header.  However, there might be a need
to change the output format (for example, color depth) of a CODEC and this
function can be used for that.  The default color depth is set to the display
mode color depth for files opened for reading (that is, playback of a movie
file).
<P>
If this function is not issued, no data compression and decompression will
be performed for MMIO_READ and MMIO_WRITE.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> for digital video files, all reads and writes are MULTITRACK_READ
and MULTITRACK_WRITE.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
