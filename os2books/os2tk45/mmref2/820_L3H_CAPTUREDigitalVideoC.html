<H1>CAPTURE (Digital Video Command) - Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 820 -->
<P>
The CAPTURE command captures the current video image.  This does not cause
the image or bitmap to be saved; the application must subsequently issue
a SAVE command to save the device element.  The device will freeze motion
temporarily if needed to capture the image and put the image into the image
device element. Repeated capture operations will overwrite the image contained
in this temporary space.  The device will wait for a <A HREF="1003_L3_SAVE.html">SAVE
</A>command to transfer the information to a file. Use<A><!-- external link: 1D 37 27 FC --> MCI_GETIMAGEBUFFER
</A>to supply an application with a copy of the capture video buffer.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If no rectangle is specified, the entire rectangle is captured.
