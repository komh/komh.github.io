<P>
Graphic buttons that are not of either GBS_TWOSTATE or GBS_AUTOTWOSTATE
styles always are considered in the Up state.
<P>
Animation can occur independently from a change in state of the button.
The drawing of animation bitmaps takes precedence over the current state
bitmap.
<P>
A multi-state button or a button that draws bitmaps in its highlighted or
disabled states is not intended to be animated, and animated buttons are
not intended to have visual states. The combination of these two styles
might yield undefined results.
