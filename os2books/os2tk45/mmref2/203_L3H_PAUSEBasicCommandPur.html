<H1>PAUSE (Basic Command) - Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 203 -->
<P>
The PAUSE command stops playing or recording.  The difference between PAUSE
and STOP is device dependent.  On video devices, PAUSE generally continues
to display the last frame, whereas STOP causes the display to blank. A device
that is paused can frequently begin playing again with less latency than
if it were stopped.
