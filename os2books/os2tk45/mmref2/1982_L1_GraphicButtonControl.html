<P>
This section describes graphic button styles and control messages. Graphic
buttons are different from other types of push buttons in that they have
graphic, two-state, and animation capabilities.  Using graphic buttons,
an application programmer can do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Display both text and bit maps on the same button.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Animate a series of bit maps.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Give the user a two-state button.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Change bit maps.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Graphic buttons permit a more intuitive interaction between a user and an
application than standard push buttons do. For example, graphic buttons
can mimic and enhance the look and feel of the physical controls found on
stereo equipment. They can emulate the two-state behavior of the Pause button
found on cassette decks; scan play buttons on CD players and VCRs; and change
or animate bit maps when control buttons are pressed.
