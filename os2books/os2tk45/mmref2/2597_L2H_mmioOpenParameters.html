<UL>
<P>
<B>pszFileName</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B 29 A9 -->PSZ</A>) - input
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The name of the file to open.  If the<I> fccIOProc
</I>field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO</A> is NULL,
mmioOpen looks at the<I> pszFileName</I> parameter to figure out what kind
of file to open, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->If the<I> pszFileName</I> parameter does not contain
a plus (+), the name is assumed to be that of a DOS file, which is opened
using the file system file open process.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->If the file name is of the form ABC.EXT+ELEMENTNAME,
the extension EXT is assumed to identify an installed I/O procedure that
is called to perform I/O on the file (see <A HREF="2570_L2_mmioInstallIOProc.html">mmioInstallIOProc</A>).
If the extension is BND, the system-provided BND I/O procedure processes
the open.  Note also that ELEMENTNAME could be of the form ABC.EXT followed
by a plus sign (+).  Parsing of the file name is done from right to left,
so the first I/O procedure called belongs to the rightmost extension name
that is followed by the +.  The I/O procedure must be already installed
and be able to further parse the file name, if required.  The trailing separator
character is stripped off by mmioOpen, and is not passed to the I/O procedure.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->If the<I> pszFileName</I> parameter is NULL, then
the<I> aulInfo</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO
</A>contains the DOS file handle, and I/O is performed on that file handle.
 The MMIO offset is the same as the DOS offset when mmioOpen is called.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->The<I> pszFileName</I> parameter cannot be longer
than 260 bytes, including the terminating NULL, for a fully-qualified path
name, or 256 bytes for an individual component name, including the terminating
NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>pmmioinfo</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 A2 -->PMMIOINFO</A>) -
input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> A pointer to a caller-provided<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure containing extra parameters used by mmioOpen. Only certain
values of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO</A> structure
may be used as input to the mmioOpen function.  These fields are<I> fccIOProc</I>,
<I>pIOProc</I>,<I> cchBuffer</I>,<I> pchBuffer</I>,<I> aulInfo</I>, and
<I>ulTranslate</I>.<I> fccIOProc</I> and<I> pIOProc</I> are used if you
wish to identify the I/O procedure to be used, rather than allowing MMIO
to determine the appropriate I/O procedure. <I> cchBuffer</I> and<I> pchBuffer
</I>are used for buffered access. <I> aulInfo</I> can contain a media type
which restricts the open to I/O procedures of that type. <I> ulTranslate
</I>is used to specify whether or not translation of header and data is
performed.
<P>
The<I> pmmioinfo</I> parameter can be NULL if the default values of the
fields of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO</A> are sufficient.
 All unused fields must be set to 0, including reserved fields.  (The easiest
way to do this is to fill the structure with NULL bytes before setting the
desired fields.)  See the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO
</A>data structure for more information.  mmioOpen will modify the<I> ulErrorRet
</I>field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 7B --> MMIOINFO</A> if an error
is encountered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>ulOpenFlags</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 29 DB -->ULONG</A>) - input
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Contains one or more of the following flags:
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MMIO_READ, MMIO_WRITE, and MMIO_READWRITE flags are mutually
exclusive.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
MMIO_READ<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens the file for reading only.  This
is the default behavior if MMIO_WRITE and MMIO_READWRITE are not specified.
 However, the flag is not automatically set in the default case.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_WRITE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file for writing.  You should not read
from a file opened in this way.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_READWRITE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens
the file for both reading and writing.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To save a wave file, you must open the file with the MMIO_READWRITE
flag.  After the data is written, the I/O procedure will need to descend
back into the wave chunk-a process that requires read support.<!-- lm: 0x2 14 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_BUFSHARED
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Requests that if MMIO services allocates the I/O
buffer, it does so from shared memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_VERTBAR
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Requests that the vertical bar symbol (|) rather
than the plus sign (+) be used as a file separator.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_EXCLUSIVE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file with exclusive mode, denying other
processes both read and write access to the file.  mmioOpen fails if the
file has<!-- entering slot 2603 --> been opened in any other mode for read
or write access, even by the current process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYWRITE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file and denies other processes write
access.  mmioOpen fails if the file has been opened in compatibility or
for write access by any other process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYREAD
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file and denies other processes read
access. mmioOpen fails if the file has been opened in compatibility or for
read access by any other process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYNONE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file and denies other processes read
access.  mmioOpen fails if the file has been opened in compatibility or
for read access by any other process.  This is the default if no share mode
flags are defined.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_CREATE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Directs
mmioOpen to create a new file.  If the file already exists, it is truncated
to 0 length.  For a memory file, MMIO_CREATE indicates the end of the file
is initially at the start of the buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DELETE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Directs mmioOpen to delete the file.  The<I> pszFileName
</I>parameter should not be NULL.  The return value will be TRUE (sent to
<I>hmmio</I>) if the file was deleted successfully, FALSE otherwise.  Do
not call <A HREF="2375_L2_mmioClose.html">mmioClose</A> if MMIO_DELETE has
been specified.  All other flags are ignored if MMIO_DELETE is specified.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>MMIO_ALLOCBUF<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Directs mmioOpen
to allocate an I/O buffer.  If the<I> cchBuffer</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 79 --> MMIOINFO
</A>is 0, then a default buffer size (specified by the constant MMIO_DEFAULTBUFFER)
is used.  If the caller provides an I/O buffer, then MMIO_ALLOCBUF should
not be specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_APPEND<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Directs
mmioOpen to allow appending to the end of the file.  This will cause the
logical file pointer to be positioned at the end of file when the open process
completes.  The open fails if both MMIO_CREATE and MMIO_APPEND are set.
 In the case of a BND element, this flag allows the element to expand past
its existing fixed boundary by deleting the existing element and rewriting
it at the end of a compound-file resource group (CGRP).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_NOIDENTIFY
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Directs mmioOpen to directly open the file without
attempting to automatically identify the file.  An automatic identify is
the default for this function.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>hmmio</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D E0 28 63 -->HMMIO</A>) - returns
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>A handle is returned to use with further calls to
MMIO functions to perform I/O.  This handle is not a file system handle.
 Do not use this with such operations as OS/2 file system read, or write.

<P>
NULL is returned if the file cannot be opened.  See the exception for the
preceding<I> ulOpenFlags</I> parameter flag MMIO_DELETE.  If the<I> pmmioinfo
</I>parameter is not NULL, the<I> ulErrorRet</I> field of its<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 79 --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure will contain extended error information returned by the I/O
procedure.  If delete fails,<I> ulErrorRet</I> contains MMIOERR_DELETE_FAILED.
 The error return can also be queried by calling the <A HREF="2518_L2_mmioGetLastError.html">mmioGetLastError
</A>function. See<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 29 9B --> Return Codes</A> for
a description of MMIO Manager error codes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
