<H1>String Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
The string interface enables application control of media devices using
textual string commands.  String commands are passed to the media control
interface through the<A><!-- external link: 1D 16 27 71 --> mciSendString
</A>function.  Return information from string commands is converted to string
format and returned in the<I> pszReturnString</I> parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D 16 27 FC --> mciSendString</A>.

<P>
Not all functions available through the procedural interface,<A><!-- external link: 1D 15 27 FC --> mciSendCommand</A>,
are available through the string interface.  In general, operations that
return complex data structures, such as a CD table of contents, are available
only through the procedural interface.  Operations that cause asynchronous
responses to be generated, such as cue point and position advise, can be
invoked from the string interface; however, their responses are returned
to window procedures.
<P>
The keywords WAIT and NOTIFY are global keywords and are available for all
commands except some system commands. As with the procedural interface,
the default time base is MMTIME. The multimedia string parser is case insensitive.

<P>
<B>Command Format</B>
<P>
The string format is:
<PRE>COMMAND ─── object ───┬────────────┬──┬──────────┬──┤
                      └─ keywords ─┘  ├─ WAIT ───┤
                                      └─ NOTIFY ─┘
</PRE>
where
<PRE>object         = device type | device name | filename | alias
keywords       = command-specific keywords
WAIT | NOTIFY  = standard OS/2 multimedia definitions
</PRE>

<P>
The object associated with a media control interface command can be one
of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Device type</B> - The default device of a given
type. The possible types of controllable devices include the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Device</B><!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>videotape<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Videotape player or recorder<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>videodisc<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Videodisc player<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>cdaudio<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> CD-ROM device that supports standard
compact disc playback<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>waveaudio<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Device that supports digital audio
files<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>sequencer<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Device that supports MIDI files<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>digitalvideo<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Device that supports audio/video
files, either hardware-assisted or software motion video only<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> If
you have multiple devices of the same type, the Multimedia Setup program
allows you to decide which device should be the default for that type.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Device
name</B> - A name of a particular device.  Device names are of the form
<I>DevicetypeNN</I>, where<I> Devicetype</I> is one of the device types
given above, and<I> NN</I> is a value (01, 02,...) indicating which device
of that type is to be controlled.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Filename
</B>- The name of a file to be opened or controlled.  When a filename is
opened, OS/2 multimedia first examines the file's extension, then its type,
to determine which device is associated to the file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Alias
</B>- A string that was specified on a previous OPEN command. This string
can then be used as the object name in subsequent commands.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The only exception to the above command format is <A HREF="073_L3_MASTERAUDIO.html">MASTERAUDIO</A>,
which does not require an object associated with the command.  The format
for <A HREF="073_L3_MASTERAUDIO.html">MASTERAUDIO</A> is:
<PRE>MASTERAUDIO ──── keywords ───┬────────┬─────┤                             └─ WAIT ─┘
</PRE>
