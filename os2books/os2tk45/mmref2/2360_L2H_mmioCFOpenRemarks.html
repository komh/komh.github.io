<P>
This function will either construct a compound-file table of contents (CTOC)
in memory for this compound file or give the caller access to a CTOC that
already exists in memory for this compound file.  Only one CTOC for a particular
compound file is maintained in memory at any given time.  This CTOC is shared
by any process that needs access to the file.
<P>
This function will determine if the CTOC for this compound file is being
maintained in memory. If so, the access and sharing modes are checked to
ensure that an open operation is allowed. The existing handle (<A><!-- external link: 1D DF 28 42 -->HMMCF</A>)
for the CTOC is returned to the caller.  If the file had not been previously
opened, this function will construct a CTOC in memory for this file.  If
the name is not pointing to a valid BND file, an error is returned.
<P>
The RIFF compound-file name cannot contain a + or | because they are used
to express elements of compound files.
<P>
The access and sharing flags are maintained only within the set of compound-file
functions.  If the RIFF compound file or elements are accessed without using
the compound-file calls, the access and sharing modes are unpredictable.
 An <A HREF="2591_L2_mmioOpen.html">mmioOpen</A> operation with a fully
qualified element name is considered a compound-file call, because it internally
calls mmioCFOpen; thus the flags are predictable in that case.
<P>
Access and sharing modes are supported for compound files.  However, these
modes are enforced only within the MMIO services compound-file functions
and the <A HREF="2591_L2_mmioOpen.html">mmioOpen</A> of compound-file elements.
 The sharing modes work as in the base operating system except that elements
ignore the sharing mode of the RIFF compound file.  Elements do obey the
access modes of the RIFF compound file.
<P>
Elements can be opened and used from the compound file by sending the element
name that is stored in the CTOC to the <A HREF="2591_L2_mmioOpen.html">mmioOpen
</A>function.
<P>
The FOURCC of FOURCC_BND should be used only for the element and not the
compound file itself.  That is, do<I> not</I> specify FOURCC_BND when using
mmioCFOpen.
