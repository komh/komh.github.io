<H1>mmioCFCompact - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2309 -->
<P>
This function is useful for writers of audio-enabling macros who use compound
files in their implementation.
<P>
The mmioCFCompact function does not use a compression algorithm to compact
the compound file.  It merely deletes elements in the CGRP whose<I> ulMedType
</I>field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 3A 29 3B --> MMCTOCENTRY</A> are marked
as FOURCC_DEL and updates the<I> ulMedType</I> field to FOURCC_FREE.  At
the completion of the function, CTOC entries are sorted according to offset.
 Entries might not remain sorted if subsequent appends are made.
<P>
The mmioCFCompact function compacts the file in place; that is, the function
rewrites the file within the same buffer as the source to save memory.  No
original can be salvaged if an error occurs during compaction.  If this
behavior is unacceptable use <A HREF="2308_L2_mmioCFCopy.html">mmioCFCopy</A>.

<P>
The <A HREF="2308_L2_mmioCFCopy.html">mmioCFCopy</A> function also compacts
a file, but it rewrites the file to a specified target name. The target
name cannot be the same as the source file name. Therefore, with this function
you must delete the source file.
