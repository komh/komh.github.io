<P>
The GROUP command allows an application to control multiple devices as a
unit, or group.  Once the group is established, the application can control
all the devices in the group with a single command.  If CLOSE is issued
directly to an instance in the group, the instance is deleted from the group.

<P>
All other commands addressed to the group must include the NOTIFY flag.
