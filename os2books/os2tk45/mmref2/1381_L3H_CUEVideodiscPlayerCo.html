<P>
The CUE command prepares for playback or recording. The CUE command does
not have to be issued prior to playback or recording; however, depending
on the device, it might reduce the delay associated with the PLAY or RECORD
command. The command fails if playing or recording is in progress.
<P>
The CUE command is not related to the <A HREF="296_L3_SETCUEPOINT.html">SETCUEPOINT
</A>command.
