<H1>CAPTURE (Video Overlay Command) - Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 1567 -->
<P>
The CAPTURE command captures the current video image.  This does not cause
the image or bit map to be saved; the application must subsequently issue
a SAVE command to save the device element.  The device will freeze motion
temporarily if needed to capture the image and put the image into the image
device element. Repeated capture operations will overwrite the image contained
in this temporary space.  The device will wait for a SAVE command to transfer
the information to a file, or MCI_GETIMAGEBUFFER to supply an application
with a copy of the image buffer.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If no rectangle is specified, the entire rectangle is captured.
