<P>
The MMPMMMIO.INI file is in the directory specified in the MMBASE environment
variable.
<P>
The DLL name (<I>szDLLName</I> field) specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 40 29 47 --> MMINIFILEINFO
</A>structure must follow the same naming conventions as the DosLoadModule
function. If the DLL or procedure name is invalid, an error is returned.

<P>
Any changes this function makes to the MMPMMMIO.INI file do not affect the
MMIO internal data structures until the next time the DLL is loaded.  This
means that in the case of an addition, for example, the I/O procedure added
is not active until the next time the MMIO.DLL is loaded.
<P>
In a deletion, the entry is removed and the entire file is rewritten to
prevent it from growing with deleted entries.  This is due to the way the
OS/2 functions handle deleting entries from INI files in general. They do
not reuse deleted entries.
<P>
If an error occurs during the loading of MMIO.DLL because the I/O procedure
or procedure name cannot be validated, MMIO.DLL will still be loaded, but
that particular I/O procedure will not be linked.  The user must program
for such situations.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When MMIO services builds its internal structures for the
I/O procedures, it processes the MMPMMMIO.INI file as a stack.  The result
is, the last I/O procedure in the file is the first one called during processing.
 Thus, in the MMPMMMIO.INI file, enter last those I/O procedures that you
want to process first.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
