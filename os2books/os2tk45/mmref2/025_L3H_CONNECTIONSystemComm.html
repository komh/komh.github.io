<P>
<B>object</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Object associated with this media
control interface command.  The object can be one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

</UL><B> QUERY
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Queries the connection as defined by the NUMBER
and TYPE item. If a connection exists, the alias of the connected device
is returned. If no alias is defined, then a null string is returned. If
QUERY and ALIAS are both specified, then the specified alias name is returned
and assigned, if possible. See the ALIAS keyword for more information on
possible errors.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NUMBER connector_number</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Indicates
the connector number to which this query applies. If this item is omitted,
then the first connector is assumed. If the TYPE keyword is included, then
the connector number is interpreted as a relative offset within the specified
connector type.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This keyword is used in conjunction with the QUERY keyword.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>TYPE connector_type</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
type of connector to which the requested action applies.  The following
connector types are defined:

device.  This data is typically streamed to an amplifier mixer device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> CD
stream<!-- lm: 0x11 13 -->
<UL> Digital output for a CD audio device capable
of reading the data directly off of a disk.  The data is typically streamed
to an amplifier mixer device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

output for a CD-ROM/XA device.  The data is typically streamed to an amplifier
mixer device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> amp stream<!-- lm: 0x11 13 -->
<UL> Digital
input or output for an amplifier mixer device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> headphones
<!-- lm: 0x11 13 -->
<UL>The connector on the device which is labeled or
is typically used to attach headphones to the device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL>The connector on the device which is labeled or
is typically used to attach a microphone to the device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> line
in<!-- lm: 0x11 13 -->
<UL> The connector on the device which is labeled
or is typically used to provide line level input to the device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> The connector on the device which is labeled
or is typically used to provide video output from the device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ALIAS
device_alias</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Defines an alias for the device
connected to the specified connector. If the alias already exists for another
device the error MCIERR_DUPLICATE_ALIAS is returned. If the device connected
to already has an alias the error MCIERR_CANNOT_ADD_ALIAS is returned.

<UL> The
command is executed synchronously.  The function waits until the requested
action is complete before returning to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NOTIFY
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The command is executed asynchronously, allowing
control to be returned immediately to the application.  When the requested
action is complete, an<A><!-- external link: 1D 22 27 FC --> MM_MCINOTIFY
