<UL>
<P>
<B>object</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Object associated with this media
control interface command.  The object can be one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>

</UL><B> DESTINATION
AT rect</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Determines the size and position of
the playback video relative to the playback window. The rectangle is relative
to the window origin in device coordinates and is specified as X1 Y1 X2
Y2.  The coordinates X1 Y1 specify the lower-left corner and X2 Y2 specify
the upper-right corner.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> WINDOW AT rect</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies
the size and position of the playback window (either a default window or
an application-defined window).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MOVE and SIZE options can both be specified, in which
case, the window is moved and sized at the same time.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
<B>MOVE</B><!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Moves the appropriate window to the
X1 Y1 coordinates specified in the rectangle.  Window coordinates are relative
to the parent window.
<P>
All coordinates of the rectangle (X1 Y1 X2 Y2) must be specified, but X2
Y2 are ignored if the SIZE keyword is not specified.
<P>
This option will not affect an application-supplied alternate video window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B>SIZE</B><!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Sizes the appropriate
window to be (X2 - X1) and (Y2 - Y1).  All coordinates of the rectangle
(X1 Y1 X2 Y2) must be specified.
<P>
This option will not affect an application-supplied alternate video window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B>MONITOR</B><!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Specifies
the position and size of the window containing the monitor rectangle.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MOVE and SIZE options can both be specified, in which
case, the monitor video window is moved and sized at the same time.<!-- lm: 0x2 12 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> RECORD
DESTINATION AT rect</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Determines the size of the
movie to be played back (playback video). The X1 and Y1 rectangle coordinates
are subtracted from X2 and Y2, respectively, to determine the playback video
size. For example, the following command:
<PRE>PUT object RECORD DESTINATION AT 13 47 173 167
</PRE>

<P>
yields a playback video size of 160x120 ((173 - 13)x(167 - 47)).
<P>
If either the width or the height of the rectangle specified with the RECORD
and DESTINATION keywords (indicating playback video size) is not a multiple
of eight, that value is rounded to the nearest multiple of eight.
<P>
Use the<B> WHERE object RECORD DESTINATION ADJUSTED</B> command to obtain
the actual size of the playback video.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> RECORD
SOURCE AT rect</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies the origin and size
of a window describing video to be captured relative to the maximum available
capture window. The rectangle coordinates for source capture are relative
to the lower-left corner of the video source.
<P>
If the device is cued for input (recording), the actual source rectangle
is displayed.  Otherwise, the maximum source rectangle is displayed with
any subset represented as an animated, dashed-line rectangle.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If only the source is set then the destination defaults to
half of the source size.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --> The video source extent can be
found using the <A HREF="1091_L3_STATUS.html">STATUS</A> command with the
HORIZONTAL VIDEO EXTENT and VERTICAL VIDEO EXTENT keywords.
<P>
If the device cannot distort and the rectangle specified with<B> PUT object
RECORD SOURCE AT rect</B> is not an integral multiple of the rectangle specified
with<B> PUT object RECORD DESTINATION AT rect</B> (playback video size),
the source and destination rectangles will be adjusted to find the nearest
values that will make the source become an integral multiple of the destination
and the destination become a multiple of eight.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The source rectangle specifies the portion of the image to
be captured and the destination rectangle specifies the size of the video
to be recorded.  This indicates the scaling to be applied to the source
rectangle.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> WAIT
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The command is executed synchronously.  The
function waits until the requested action is complete before returning to
the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> NOTIFY</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
command is executed asynchronously, allowing control to be returned immediately
to the application.  When the requested action is complete, an<A><!-- external link: 1D 22 27 FC --> MM_MCINOTIFY
</A>message is sent to the application window procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
