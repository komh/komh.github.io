<UL>
<P>
<B>ulFlags</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 29 54 -->ULONG</A>) - input
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Contains none or some of the following flags.  The
MMIO_READ, MMIO_WRITE, and MMIO_READWRITE flags are mutually exclusive.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
MMIO_READ<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Open the file for reading only.  This
is the default if MMIO_WRITE and MMIO_READWRITE are not specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_WRITE
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Open the file for writing.  A file cannot be read
from if the file is opened in this mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_READWRITE
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Open the file for both reading and writing.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_EXCLUSIVE
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Open the file with exclusive mode, denying other
processes both read and write access to the file.  mmioCFOpen fails if the
file has been opened in any other mode for read or write access, even by
the current process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYWRITE<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Open
the file and deny other processes write access to the file.  mmioCFOpen
fails if the file has been opened by a compatible process or for write access
by any other process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYREAD<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Open
the file and deny other processes read access to the file.  mmioCFOpen fails
if the file has been opened by a compatible process or for read access by
any other process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYNONE<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Open
the file and deny other processes read access to the file.  mmioCFOpen fails
if the file has been opened by a compatible process or for read access by
any other process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_CREATE<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Directs
mmioCFOpen to create a new file.  If the file already exists, it is truncated
to 0 length, unless it is already opened.  In that case, a handle (<A><!-- external link: 1D DF 28 2C -->HMMCF</A>)
to the RIFF compound file is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
