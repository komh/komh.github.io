<P>
This function decrements the usage count of the compound-file table of contents
(CTOC) maintained in memory for this RIFF compound file.  If the usage count
drops to 0, the CTOC is written to disk, and the RIFF compound-file handle
is closed.  An mmioCFClose operation fails if there are any open elements
for this RIFF compound file.  The user will get an error if <A HREF="2375_L2_mmioClose.html">mmioClose
</A>is used instead of mmioCFClose when trying to close a RIFF compound
file.
<P>
If this is an<I> ExitList</I> close, all open elements are closed, and the
mmioCFClose operation is allowed.  If the compound file was opened as read-only,
the CTOC will not be rewritten.
<P>
If the mmioCFClose function fails and the user had modified compound-file-resource-group
(CGRP) elements, the data stored on the file is inconsistent.  To correct
the problem, the user must create free file space and attempt to close again.
