<H1>RECORD (Digital Video Command) - Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 977 -->
<P>
The RECORD command initiates real-time recording of motion video with audio
capture.
<P>
The functionality of video record, capture, and monitor is performed through
an media control interface logical device.  An association between a logical
device name and any video capture cards is established automatically during
installation. <I> Digitalvideo01</I> is the logical device that supports
playback only, with unmodified functionality from the original OS/2 multimedia
installation, and is not associated with a capture device. <I> Digitalvideo02
</I>(and higher) enables capture and recording, and is associated with capture
hardware. These logical device names are produced by default through installation
of OS/2 multimedia and Video IN for OS/2.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Only a single actively recording instance is supported at
a time, as video capture hardware does not support concurrent use.  Multiple
instances of the MCD can be opened, but only one recording instance can
be open.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
