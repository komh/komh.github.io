<UL> Returns the percentage of
dropped frames for playback or recording operations.  The value returned
is in the range 0-100, where a value of 0 indicates that no frame drops
are occurring or have occurred.  A value of 100 indicates that all frames
are being dropped or have been dropped.
<P>
This STATUS value can be queried during a recording operation to obtain
the cumulative drops that have occurred since recording began.  This value
can also be queried during a playback operation to obtain the cumulative
frame drops that have occurred since playback began or was resumed after
a seek, pause, or stop.  If the value is queried when the device is stopped,
the percentage of dropped frames accumulated at the end of the last playback
or recording operation that was performed is returned.
<P>
A value of 0 is returned if no playback or recording operations have been
performed, the device is seeking or has been seeked, or the device is playing
in scan mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
