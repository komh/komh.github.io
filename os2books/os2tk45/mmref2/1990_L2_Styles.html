<P>
The base graphic button provides the ability to display bitmaps and text;
it defaults to the Up state.  Additional styles can be used to increase
its function.
<P>
Graphic button controls have the following window styles:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
GBS_TWOSTATE<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> A two-state graphic button has two
states-Up and Down.  If the button is in the Up state, the button is drawn
with the Z-order above the owner.  If the button is in the Down state, the
button is drawn with the Z-order below the owner. Typically, the Up state
expresses to the user that the button's action is selectable; while the
Down state expresses that the action is being processed currently.  Related

</UL>GBS_AUTOTWOSTATE<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> An automatic
two-state graphic button automatically toggles its state from Up to Down
and from Down to Up whenever the user clicks on it.  No message from the
owner is required for the button to toggle its state.  Related messages

</UL> GBS_ANIMATION<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> An
animation graphic button can animate a series of bitmaps. The bitmaps are
displayed in ascending sequential order. The series is treated as a circular
list:  when the last bitmap of the series is reached, the next bitmap displayed
is the first in the series. Related messages are <A HREF="2010_L2_GBM_ANIMATE.html">GBM_ANIMATE</A>,
