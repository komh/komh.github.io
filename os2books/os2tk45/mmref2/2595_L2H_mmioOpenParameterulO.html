<H1>mmioOpen Parameter - ulOpenFlags</H1><!-- entering slot 2600 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>ulOpenFlags</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 29 BC -->ULONG</A>) - input
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Contains one or more of the following flags:
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MMIO_READ, MMIO_WRITE, and MMIO_READWRITE flags are mutually
exclusive.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
MMIO_READ<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens the file for reading only.  This
is the default behavior if MMIO_WRITE and MMIO_READWRITE are not specified.
 However, the flag is not automatically set in the default case.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_WRITE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file for writing.  You should not read
from a file opened in this way.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_READWRITE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens
the file for both reading and writing.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To save a wave file, you must open the file with the MMIO_READWRITE
flag.  After the data is written, the I/O procedure will need to descend
back into the wave chunk-a process that requires read support.<!-- lm: 0x2 14 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_BUFSHARED
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Requests that if MMIO services allocates the I/O
buffer, it does so from shared memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_VERTBAR
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Requests that the vertical bar symbol (|) rather
than the plus sign (+) be used as a file separator.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_EXCLUSIVE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Opens the file with exclusive mode, denying other
processes both read and write access to the file.  mmioOpen fails if the
file has been opened in any other mode for read or write access, even by
the current process.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DENYWRITE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens
the file and denies other processes write access.  mmioOpen fails if the
file has been opened in compatibility or for write access by any other process.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>MMIO_DENYREAD<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens the
file and denies other processes read access. mmioOpen fails if the file
has been opened in compatibility or for read access by any other process.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>MMIO_DENYNONE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Opens the
file and denies other processes read access.  mmioOpen fails if the file
has been opened in compatibility or for read access by any other process.
 This is the default if no share mode flags are defined.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_CREATE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Directs mmioOpen to create a new file.  If the
file already exists, it is truncated to 0 length.  For a memory file, MMIO_CREATE
indicates the end of the file is initially at the start of the buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_DELETE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Directs mmioOpen to delete the file.  The<I> pszFileName
</I>parameter should not be NULL.  The return value will be TRUE (sent to
<I>hmmio</I>) if the file was deleted successfully, FALSE otherwise.  Do
not call <A HREF="2375_L2_mmioClose.html">mmioClose</A> if MMIO_DELETE has
been specified.  All other flags are ignored if MMIO_DELETE is specified.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>MMIO_ALLOCBUF<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Directs mmioOpen
to allocate an I/O buffer.  If the<I> cchBuffer</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 76 --> MMIOINFO
</A>is 0, then a default buffer size (specified by the constant MMIO_DEFAULTBUFFER)
is used.  If the caller provides an I/O buffer, then MMIO_ALLOCBUF should
not be specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_APPEND<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Directs
mmioOpen to allow appending to the end of the file.  This will cause the
logical file pointer to be positioned at the end of file when the open process
completes.  The open fails if both MMIO_CREATE and MMIO_APPEND are set.
 In the case of a BND element, this flag allows the element to expand past
its existing fixed boundary by deleting the existing element and rewriting
it at the end of a compound-file resource group (CGRP).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MMIO_NOIDENTIFY
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Directs mmioOpen to directly open the file without
attempting to automatically identify the file.  An automatic identify is
the default for this function.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
