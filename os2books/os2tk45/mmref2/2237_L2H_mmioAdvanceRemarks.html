<H1>mmioAdvance - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2242 -->
<P>
The mmioAdvance function does not change the current file position of the
file represented by the<I> hmmio</I> parameter, that is,<I> pchNext</I> of
the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 40 --> MMIOINFO</A> structure passed
in the<I> pmmioinfo</I> parameter will correspond to the same data position
before and after mmioAdvance is called, hence pointing to the same piece
of data that is now located at the beginning of the buffer.  mmioAdvance
simply makes available as much buffer space as possible for doing direct
buffer reading or writing.
<P>
When mmioAdvance returns from a call where the MMIO_READ flag was specified,
there will be at least<I> n</I> bytes of data available to be read in the
I/O buffer (that is,<I> n</I> bytes between<I> pchNext</I> and<I> pchEndRead</I>),
where<I> n</I> is the lesser of the I/O buffer size and the number of remaining
bytes of data.
<P>
When mmioAdvance returns from a call where the MMIO_WRITE flag was specified,
at least<I> n</I> bytes of free space in the I/O buffer (that is,<I> n</I> bytes
between<I> pchNext</I> and<I> pchEndWrite</I>) where<I> n</I> is specified
in the<I> aulInfo[0]</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 40 --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure passed on an <A HREF="2591_L2_mmioOpen.html">mmioOpen</A> called
if the file is a memory file, or the size of the I/O buffer if the file
is not a memory file.
<P>
If the file is opened for reading, the I/O buffer is filled from the disk.
 If the file is opened for writing and the MMIO_DIRTY flag is set in the
<I>ulFlags</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 40 --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure, the buffer is written to disk.  The<I> pchNext</I>,<I> pchEndRead</I>,
and<I> pchEndWrite</I> fields of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 40 --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure are updated to reflect the new state of the I/O buffer.
<P>
If the file was opened for both reading and writing, and the I/O buffer
was written to, the contents of the I/O buffer are written to disk before
the next buffer is read.
<P>
If you have written to the I/O buffer, you must set the MMIO_DIRTY flag
of the<I> ulFlags</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 40 --> MMIOINFO
</A>structure before calling mmioAdvance.  Otherwise, the buffer will not
be written to disk.
<P>
The<I> pchNext</I> field must also be updated to reflect the data written
in the I/O buffer.  The I/O buffer will be written up to (but not including)
the position indicated by the<I> pchNext</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 42 29 FC --> MMIOINFO</A>.
