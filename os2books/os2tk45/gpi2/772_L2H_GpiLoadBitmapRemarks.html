<P>
Some bit-map functions, including drawing into the bit map, require it to
be selected into a memory device context, using <A HREF="2277_L2_GpiSetBitmap.html">GpiSetBitmap</A>.
 This is true whether device or main memory is used to hold the bit map.

<P>
The bit map is stretched to the specified<I> lWidth</I> and<I> lHeight</I>.
 If<I> lWidth</I> or<I> lHeight</I> is 0, the bit map is not stretched in
that direction; when, for example,<I> lWidth</I> = 0, the bit map is not
stretched horizontally, when<I> lHeight</I> = 0, it is not stretched vertically.

<P>
The bit map may have been created by the icon editor in bit-map mode.
<P>
There are a number of standard bit-map formats that should normally be adhered
to.  Other formats can be used if supported by the device.
<P>
The bit map is owned by the process from which this function is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists
when the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.
