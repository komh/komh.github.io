<H1>GpiPolySpline - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1066 -->
<P>
The first Bezier spline starts from the current position and goes to the
third specified point, with the first and second points used as control
points. Subsequent splines start from the ending point of the previous spline,
and end at the next specified point but two, with the intervening points
their first and second control points. It is the responsibility of the application
to ensure that the gradient is continuous at each end and start point, if
this is required.
<P>
On completion, the current position is set to the last specified point.
Each individual spline always lies within the area bounded by the start,
end, and control points.
<P>
It is not an error for any of the points to be coincident.
<P>
The maximum number of splines allowed is more than 2 500.
