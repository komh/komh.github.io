<UL> An
attempt was made to associate a presentation space and a metafile device
context with incompatible page units, size or coordinate format; or to play
a metafile using the RES_RESET option (to reset the presentation space)
to a presentation space that is itself associated with a metafile device
context.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

(0x2105)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Segment drawing or GpiPlayMetaFile was
stopped prematurely in response to a <A HREF="2909_L2_GpiSetStopDraw.html">GpiSetStopDraw
