<P>
The sides of the box are parallel to the world coordinate x- and y-axes.

<P>
The four corners of the box can be rounded with a quarter ellipse. The size
of this ellipse is specified by<I> lHRound</I> and<I> lVRound</I>. If<I> lHRound
</I>equals<I> lVRound</I>, the corners of the box are rounded with a quarter
circle.
<P>
If either<I> lHRound</I> or<I> lVRound</I> is zero, no rounding occurs.

<P>
If the current position is (x0,y0) and<I> pptlPoint</I> is set to (x1,y1),
the box is drawn from (x0,y0) to (x1,y0) to (x1,y1) to (x0,y1) to (x0,y0).
 The direction of drawing is significant in area winding mode; see <A HREF="026_L2_GpiBeginArea.html">GpiBeginArea</A>.

<P>
The current position is unchanged by this function.
<P>
Either the outline of the box, or its interior, or both, can be drawn.
<P>
If this function occurs within an area or path definition, it generates
a complete closed figure (DRO_OUTLINE must be specified). It must not occur
within any other figure definition.
<P>
If correlation is in force, a hit always results if the pick aperture intersects
the box boundary.  However, if the pick aperture lies wholly within the
box, a hit only occurs if the interior is being drawn (DRO_FILL or DRO_OUTLINEFILL).
