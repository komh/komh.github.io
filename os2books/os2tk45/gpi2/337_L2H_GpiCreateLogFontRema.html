<P>
The system uses the available physical font that most closely matches the
requirements. Physical fonts can be:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Loaded at initialization time<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Built into particular devices or device drivers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Private ones for this process, loaded by <A HREF="777_L2_GpiLoadFonts.html">GpiLoadFonts</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application can force selection of a particular physical font by quoting
the<I> lMatch</I> value in<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C4 45 --> FATTRS
</A>to be returned for the desired font by <A HREF="1593_L2_GpiQueryFonts.html">GpiQueryFonts</A>.
However, this method is only valid for a particular device/device driver
combination on a single machine. This method should be avoided as a method
for selecting fonts.
<P>
Whichever method is used, the choice of physical font, which is made when
this function is issued, is never subsequently changed for a particular
logical font.
<P>
The local identifier (<I>lLcid</I>) that the application decides to use
to reference this logical font for later drawing operations is also specified;
see <A HREF="2395_L2_GpiSetCharSet.html">GpiSetCharSet</A>.
<P>
If the face name is provided, GpiCreateLogFont tries to select the font
with that face name. If the face name is empty, GpiCreateLogFont selects
a default font.
<P>
When a match number is provided, GpiCreateLogFont tries to find a font with
the same match number and face name. If there is a mismatch at this point,
GpiCreateLogFont acts as though the match number is 0 and starts the search
again.
<P>
When the match number is 0 and the calling program requests a bit-map font
(FATTR_FONTUSE_OUTLINE not set), GpiCreateLogFont searches for a bit-map
font with the required average character width (AveCharWidth) and maximum
baseline extent (MaxBaselineExt), consistent with the usage flags. If this
search fails, GpiCreateLogFont searches for an outline font with the required
face name.
<P>
When the match number is zero and the calling program requests an outline
font (FATTR_FONTUSE_OUTLINE is set), GpiCreateLogFont searches for an outline
font with the required selection flags. If that search fails, a default
outline font is selected. If the match number is set to a positive number,
a Presentation Manager font is selected. If the match number is negative,
a font belonging to a physical device is selected.
<P>
It is advisable to set the values of<I> all</I> the elements in the<I> pfatAttrs
</I>structure. This is particularly important where printing, plotting,
or interchange are concerned, as the target machine may need to substitute
an existing device font for the requested font.
<P>
To anticipate possible substitution by a vector font, values should be set
for character angle, character shear and character box (using <A HREF="2325_L2_GpiSetCharAngle.html">GpiSetCharAngle</A>,
<A HREF="2407_L2_GpiSetCharShear.html">GpiSetCharShear</A>, and <A HREF="2337_L2_GpiSetCharBox.html">GpiSetCharBox
</A>respectively) before drawing any character strings. The <A HREF="1582_L2_GpiQueryFontMetrics.html">GpiQueryFontMetrics
</A>function can be used to get the values of the character box height and
width for a font.  These are held in the fields<I> lEmHeight</I> and<I> lEmInc
</I>in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C4 4C --> FONTMETRICS</A> structure.

<P>
Outline font characters are normally drawn filled; however, hollow characters
are produced if the FATTR_SEL_OUTLINE flag is set in the<I> pfatAttrs</I> parameter.
For small characters, outlining in this way can give a similar visual appearance
to filled characters, with improved performance.
<P>
There are restrictions on the use of non-installed fonts with certain device
types. See <A HREF="777_L2_GpiLoadFonts.html">GpiLoadFonts</A> for more
details.
<P>
If this function occurs within a path definition when the drawing mode (see
<A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>) is<B> retain
</B>or<B> draw-and-retain</B>, its<!-- entering slot 343 --> effect is not
stored with the definition.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> There are restrictions on the use of this function when creating
SAA-conforming metafiles; see "MetaFile Resolutions" in the<I> Presentation
Manager Programming Reference</I> for more information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
