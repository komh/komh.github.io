<P>
The coordinates of the point<I> pgradlAngle</I> specify integer values for
the coordinates of the end of a line starting at the origin (0,0); the base
line for subsequent character strings is parallel to this line.
<P>
The effect of the baseline angle attribute depends on the value of the character
mode attribute (see <A HREF="2383_L2_GpiSetCharMode.html">GpiSetCharMode</A>),
and whether the current font is an outline or a raster font, as described
below.
<P>
When the character mode is set to CM_MODE1, and the current font is a raster
font, the character angle can be ignored.
<P>
When the character mode is set to CM_MODE2, and the current font is a raster
font, the angle is used to determine the position of each character, but
the orientations of characters within the character box may not be affected
by changes in character angle.  If this is so, the characters are positioned
so that the lower left-hand corners of the character definitions are placed
at the lower left-hand corners of the character boxes after all transforms
have been applied. This is illustrated below.
<P>
For illustrative purposes, the figure shows all character reference points
at their bottom left-hand corner.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="2331_L2H_GpiSetCharAngleRemar_9.gif" WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=336>
<P>
When the character mode is set to CM_MODE3, or when the current font is
an outline font, the angle is observed accurately, and the character boxes
are rotated to be normal (perpendicular) to the character baseline. If the
world coordinate system is such that one x-axis unit is not physically equal
to one y-axis unit, a rotated character string appears to be sheared.
<P>
This function must not be issued in an area bracket.
<P>
The attribute mode determines whether the current value of the baseline
angle attribute is preserved.
