<P>
A rectangle of bit-map image data is copied from storage to a bit map selected
into a device context associated with the target presentation space. Alternatively,
the target presentation space can be associated with a device context that
specifies a suitable raster device, for example, the screen. An error occurs
if this device does not support raster operations.
<P>
The source bits must be in one of the standard bit-map formats.
<P>
A rectangle is specified in device coordinates for the source bits, and
one in world coordinates for the target presentation space.  The source
rectangle is noninclusive; the left and lower boundaries in device space
are included, but not the right and upper boundaries.  Thus if the bottom
left is equal to the top right, the rectangle is deemed to be empty. The
target rectangle is "inclusive-inclusive"; that is, all boundaries are included
in the rectangle.
<P>
If the target rectangle, after transformation to device coordinates and
adjustment for inclusivity, is not the same size as the source rectangle,
then stretching or compressing of the data occurs.<I> flOptions</I> specifies
how eliminated rows or columns of bits are to be treated if compression
occurs.  Note that the pattern data is never stretched or compressed.
<P>
These current attributes of the target presentation space are used (other
than for converting between monochrome and color, as described below):<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area background color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern set<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The color values are used in conversion between monochrome and color data.
 This is the only format conversion performed by this function.  The conversions
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Output of a monochrome pattern to a color device
<P>
In this instance the pattern is converted first to a color pattern, using
the current area colors:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 1s -&gt; area foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 8 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>source
0s -&gt; area background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Copying
from a monochrome bit map to a color bit map (or device)
<P>
The source bits are converted as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 1s -&gt; image foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 0s -&gt; image background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Copying
from a color bit map to a monochrome bit map (or device)
<P>
The source bits are converted as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source nonzeros -&gt; image foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 0s -&gt; image background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the mix (<I>lRop</I>) does not call for a pattern, the pattern set and
pattern symbol are not used.
<P>
Neither the source nor the pattern is required when a bit map, or part of
a bit map, is to be cleared to a particular color.
<P>
If the mix does require both source and pattern, a three-way operation is
performed.
<P>
If a pattern is required, dithering may be performed for solid patterns
in a color that is not available on the device. See <A HREF="2775_L2_GpiSetPattern.html">GpiSetPattern</A>.

<P>
Support for the BM_SRCTRANSPARENT and BM_DESTTRANSPARENT background mix
options is provided by the CAPS_BACKGROUND_MIX_SUPPORT flags in DevQueryCaps.

<P>
Requesting the BM_SRCTRANSPARENT background mix option results in pels from
the source bit map matching the presentaton space background color, to not
be copied to the output bit map, effectively leaving those pels in the output
unchanged. This provides for a transparent overlay function.
<P>
Requesting the BM_DESTTRANSPARENT background mix option results in a transfer
such that pels from the source bit map will only be copied to destination
pels that match the presentation space background color. This provides for
a transparent underlay function.
<P>
This function can cause immediate drawing, or be retained in segment store,
or both of these, depending upon the drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>).
If the function is retained in segment store, the storage identified by
the<I> pBits</I> and<I> pbmiInfoTable</I> parameters must not be changed
or freed by the application while the segment containing the function can
still be drawn. However, if a metafile is generated and no further drawing
is needed, this does not apply, as the information is encaptured in the
metafile.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> There are restrictions on the use of this function when creating
SAA-conforming metafiles; see "MetaFile Resolutions" in the<I> Presentation
Manager Programming<!-- entering slot 520 --> Reference</I> for more information.
