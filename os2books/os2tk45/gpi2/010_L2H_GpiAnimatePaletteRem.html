<P>

<P>
The animating indexes are those that have the PC_RESERVED flag set in the
palette and also in the corresponding element of the<I> aulTable</I> array
in this function.
<P>
If an animating index already has an entry in the physical hardware palette
(allocated from a previous call to WinRealizePalette), both that entry and
the entry in the logical palette are changed. If there is not an entry in
the physical palette, or the device does not support palette functions,
the logical palette color is changed. This function does not allocate a
new entry in the physical palette.
<P>
This function ignores those elements in<I> aulTable</I> corresponding to
non-animating indexes (those that do not have the PC_RESERVED flag set).
Their colors are not changed.
<P>
All presentation spaces that have this palette selected into them (see <A HREF="2204_L2_GpiSelectPalette.html">GpiSelectPalette</A>)
are updated with the effects of this function. It is not necessary to issue
a WinRealizePalette function before the effects become visible.
<P>
If a palette is selected into a presentation space that is associated with
a device context of type OD_METAFILE or OD_METAFILE_NOQUERY, only the final
color values are recorded in the metafile.
<P>
It is an error if a palette is selected into a presentation space that is
within an area or path definition when this function is issued.
