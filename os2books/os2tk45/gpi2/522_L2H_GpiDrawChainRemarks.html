<P>
The segments drawn are all of the retained segments that have the ATTR_CHAINED
segment attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
together with all of the unchained segments that are called from them.
<P>
The drawing operation is controlled by the calls set by the draw controls
(see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>), except
for the correlate control. If there is not a segment open at the time of
the draw, and this function is followed by primitives or attributes, without
first opening a segment, the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.

<P>
If a segment is already open at the time of the draw, <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment
</A>processing is not performed at the completion of the draw (except that
any unclosed path or area is abandoned with an error). In this instance,
if the open segment is the last one drawn (and no dynamic segments had to
be drawn), attributes and other parameters are in the correct state to continue
drawing in any drawing mode.
<P>
Dynamic segments are not drawn if they are found while processing the segment
chain.  However, depending on the setting of DCTL_DYNAMIC (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>),
they may be removed before, and drawn after, the operation.
<P>
It may be necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current
position, and viewing limits are reset to their default values, before processing
the chain. This can be done by ensuring that the first segment to be drawn
does not have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiDrawChain. The latter method also resets the clip path to no clipping,
which may also be necessary.
<P>
It is an error to issue this function while any of these brackets are open:
