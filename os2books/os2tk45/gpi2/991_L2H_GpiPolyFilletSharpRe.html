<P>
The first fillet is drawn using the two imaginary lines, one from current
position to its control point (the first point specified in<I> aptlPoints</I>),
and one from this point to the second point specified in<I> aptlPoints</I>.
 The fillet starts from current position, and ends at this second point.
It is tangential to the first line at current position, and to the second
line at the second point of<I> aptlPoints</I>. The sharpness of this fillet
is given by the first element of the<I> afxPoints</I> array.
<P>
Each subsequent fillet is drawn starting from the end point of the previous
fillet, and uses the next two lines in the sequence, in a similar way. Therefore
two points and one sharpness value are required for each fillet.
<P>

The sharpness of each fillet is defined as follows.  Let A and C be the
start and end points, respectively, of the fillet, and let B be the control
point. Let W be the mid-point of AC. Let D be the point where the fillet
intersects WB.

<P>
On completion, the current position is the end point of the last line in
the series. Each individual fillet always lies within the area bounded by
the start, end, and control points.
<P>
It is not an error for any of the points to be coincident.
<P>
The maximum number of fillets allowed is more than 2 000.
