<P>
Any type of device context may be used.
<P>
Subsequent drawing functions direct output to the associated device context.

<P>
If a null handle is supplied for the device context, the presentation space
is dissociated from its currently-associated device context. An associated
presentation space cannot be associated with another device context, and
an associated device context cannot be associated with another presentation
space.
<P>
An error occurs if you try to draw to a presentation space associated with
a memory device context that has no bit map selected into it (see <A HREF="2277_L2_GpiSetBitmap.html">GpiSetBitmap</A>).

<P>
The processing described for GRES_ATTRS (see <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A>)
is performed on the presentation space.  Also, bounds data is destroyed,
the page viewport is reset to its default value (see <A HREF="356_L2_GpiCreatePS.html">GpiCreatePS</A>),
and any clip region and path definition are lost. The save/restore presentation-space
stack (see <A HREF="2180_L2_GpiSavePS.html">GpiSavePS</A>) is purged.
<P>
Any palette selected into the presentation space remains selected.
<P>
Any dynamic segments left drawn on the device are not subsequently removed
by <A HREF="2111_L2_GpiRemoveDynamics.html">GpiRemoveDynamics</A>.
