<P>
This function usually indicates that a dynamic segment is about to be updated;
and that, having completed the update, <A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics
</A>is called to redraw the dynamic segments.
<P>
If there is more than one dynamic segment, only those that are being updated
need be removed. The section of the segment chain is identified by the first
and last segments in the section.  If<I> lFirstSegid</I> and<I> lLastSegid
</I>have the same value, this call erases only the parts drawn from the
segment, and by calls from that segment.
<P>
Specifying the range of segment identifiers that are to be removed usually
has a performance advantage, in that searching of the chain stops after
<I>lLastSegid</I> has been processed. It can also be used to operate on
less than the maximum number of dynamic segments, as in one of the following
examples:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Several dynamic segments are currently drawn, but
only one is to be updated. Identifying this segment with both<I> lFirstSegid
</I>and<I> lLastSegid</I> means that only this one is removed. It can then
be updated, and replaced with <A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A new dynamic segment can be created, while the rest
remain drawn. GpiRemoveDynamics is issued before the segment has been created
(or while it is unchained, if it already exists), identifying it with both
<I>lFirstSegid</I> and<I> lLastSegid</I>. It is then created with this identifier
(or chained, if it already exists), and <A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics
</A>is issued, causing it to be drawn.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In these examples, the other dynamic segments remain drawn throughout.
<P>
In all cases, after <A HREF="517_L2_GpiDrawChain.html">GpiDrawChain</A>,
<A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics</A>, <A HREF="537_L2_GpiDrawFrom.html">GpiDrawFrom</A>,
or <A HREF="549_L2_GpiDrawSegment.html">GpiDrawSegment</A>, where the DCTL_DYNAMIC
draw control is set (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>),
<I>all</I> dynamic segments must be drawn. The<I> lFirstSegid</I> and<I> lLastSegid
</I>parameters of GpiRemoveDynamics, cannot be used to cause a subset of
dynamic segments to be drawn after the following <A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics</A>.
If this is required, it can be done by unchaining the unwanted dynamic segments
after first removing them.
<P>
Dynamic segments that are currently drawn must never be updated in the segment
store, nor must any drawing in mix modes (other than exclusive-OR or leave-alone)
be done to a presentation space while dynamic segments are drawn in it.

<P>
If a temporary re-association is to be done, this function must be issued
to remove the dynamic segments from the display before the first dissociation.

<P>
It is necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current position,
and viewing limits are reset to their default values, before processing
the segments. This can either be done by ensuring that the first dynamic
segment in the removed section does not have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute
(see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiRemoveDynamics. The latter method also resets the clip path to cause
no clipping, which may also be necessary.
<P>
If this function is followed by primitives or attributes, without first
opening a segment, the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.
In particular, note that during GpiRemoveDynamics, the system forces the
foreground mix to FM_XOR and the background mix to BM_LEAVEALONE. It may
be necessary to set one or both of these before starting to draw.
<P>
If<I> lFirstSegid</I> does not exist, or is not in the segment chain, no
removal or drawing occurs. However, the segment identifier range is still
established for a subsequent <A HREF="527_L2_GpiDrawDynamics.html">GpiDrawDynamics
</A>function.
<P>
If<I> lLastSegid</I> does not exist, or is not in the chain, or is chained
before<I> lFirstSegid</I>, no error is raised, and processing continues
to the end of the chain.
