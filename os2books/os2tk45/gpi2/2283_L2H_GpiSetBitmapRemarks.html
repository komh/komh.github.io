<P>
The specified presentation space must be currently associated with a memory
device context. The device context can represent a different physical device
from the one that the bit map originally loaded or created, providing its
format is convertible to one supported on the new device.  This is ensured
when one of the standard formats is being used.
<P>
If a bit map is already current in the device context, the handle of this
bit map is returned, before the new bit map is selected.
<P>
It is an error if the new bit map is already selected as the current bit
map in any device context.
