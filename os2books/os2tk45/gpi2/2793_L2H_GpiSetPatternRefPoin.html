<P>
The pattern reference point is the point to which the origin of the area
filling pattern maps.  The pattern is mapped into the area to be filled
by conceptually replicating the pattern definition in a horizontal and vertical
direction.
<P>
Because the pattern reference point is subject to all of the transforms,
if an area is moved by changing a transform and redrawing, the fill pattern
also appears to move, so as to retain its position relative to the area
boundaries.
<P>
The pattern reference point, which is specified in world coordinates, need
not be inside the actual area to be filled.  The pattern reference point
is not subject to clipping.
<P>
This function must not be issued in an area or path bracket.
<P>
The attribute mode (see <A HREF="2227_L2_GpiSetAttrMode.html">GpiSetAttrMode</A>)
determines whether the current value of the pattern reference point is preserved.

<P>
The initial default pattern reference point is (0,0). This can be changed
with <A HREF="2489_L2_GpiSetDefAttrs.html">GpiSetDefAttrs</A>.
