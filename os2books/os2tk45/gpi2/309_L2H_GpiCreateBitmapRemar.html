<P>
On some devices it is possible to create the bit map in device memory. Even
when this is not possible, a bit map always belongs to a particular device.
The device is specified through the device context associated with the specified
presentation space. The device context can be any device context that describes
the physical device (such as any window device context for the screen).

<P>
There are a number of standard bit-map formats that should normally be adhered
to. Other formats can be used if supported by the device.
<P>
A newly created bit map can be filled with data supplied by the application.
This is useful where the bit map always contains, or always starts with,
the same image, captured in the application. A bit-map information structure
is also passed, which defines the format and color usage of the initialization
data. It is assumed that enough data is passed to initialize the entire
bit map.
<P>
Some bit-map functions, including those that draw into the bit map, require
the bit map to be selected into a memory device context, using <A HREF="2277_L2_GpiSetBitmap.html">GpiSetBitmap</A>.
This is true whether device or main memory is used to hold the bit map.

<P>
The bit map is owned by the process from which this function is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists
when the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.

<P>
Some restrictions apply when using this function. Refer to "Format of Interchange
Files" in the<I> Presentation Manager Programming Reference</I> for additional
details.
