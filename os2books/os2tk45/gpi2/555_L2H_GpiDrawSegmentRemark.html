<P>
The drawing operation is controlled by the calls set by the draw controls
(see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>), except
for the correlate control.
<P>
If there is not a segment open at the time of the draw, and this function
is followed by primitives or attributes, without first opening a segment,
the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.

<P>
If a segment is already open at the time of the draw, <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment
</A>processing is not performed at the completion of the draw (except that
any unclosed path or area is abandoned with an error). In this instance,
if the open segment is the segment specified in<I> lSegment</I>, and no
dynamic segments had to be drawn, then attributes and other parameters are
in the correct state to continue drawing in any drawing mode.
<P>
Depending on the setting of DCTL_DYNAMIC (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>),
all of the dynamic segments in the chain may be removed before, and drawn
after, the specified segment is drawn.  (Note that if the specified segment
is itself dynamic, it is only drawn in this way.)
<P>
This function differs from the other GpiDraw... calls, in that the segment
to be drawn need not be a chained segment.
<P>
It may be necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current
position, and viewing limits are reset to their default values, before processing
the segment. This can be done either by ensuring that the segment does not
have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiDrawSegment. The latter method also resets the clip path to no clipping,
which may also be necessary.
<P>
It is an error to issue this function while any of these brackets are open:
