<P>
The outline of the path is drawn, using the line attributes, including cosmetic
line width (see <A HREF="2651_L2_GpiSetLineWidth.html">GpiSetLineWidth</A>)
but not geometric line width (see <A HREF="2663_L2_GpiSetLineWidthGeom.html">GpiSetLineWidthGeom</A>).
This normally has the same effect as if the lines, curves, and so on, which
comprise the path, had been drawn without defining them as being within
a path. However, if character strings (referencing outline fonts) are contained
within the path, the outlines of the characters, without the interior fill,
are drawn by GpiOutlinePath, giving the appearance of hollow characters.

<P>
Open figures within the path are not closed automatically.
<P>
When the outline of the path has been drawn, the path is deleted.
