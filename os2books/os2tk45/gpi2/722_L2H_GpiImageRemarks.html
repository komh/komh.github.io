<P>
All images are a rectangular array of pels (display points), each pel being
represented by one bit.
<P>
<I>psizlImageSize</I>, which defines the width and height of the image,
determines how many pels there are in the horizontal and vertical directions.

<P>
<I>pbData</I> determines which of the pels are visible; a 1 bit sets the
associated pel, using the image foreground color and mix, and a 0 bit sets
the pel using the image background color and mix.
<P>
The top left-hand corner of the image is placed at the current position,
and the data supplied is drawn row by row, starting at the top.  Each row
is drawn from left to right and must be padded out to an integral number
of bytes if the image width specified is not a multiple of 8.  For example,
if the image width specified is 12, each row of data must be padded out
to a length of 16 so that the data in the row occupies exactly 2 bytes.

<P>
Within each byte the high-order bit is drawn on the left.
<P>
The length of image data specified must include the padding of each row
of data.  The length must be given in bytes, and an error message is issued
if it is wrong.
<P>
If the image is being stored in a metafile, then (((pels_per_row + 9) /
8) * pels_per_column) + 10, must be less than 32768.
<P>
Because of the different sizes of pels for different devices, the relationship
of the image with respect to other graphics primitives is device-dependent.

<P>
The current position remains unchanged after the image has been drawn.
