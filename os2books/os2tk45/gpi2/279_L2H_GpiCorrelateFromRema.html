<H1>GpiCorrelateFrom - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 284 -->
<P>
The correlation operation starts at the segment identified by<I> lFirstSegment
</I>and includes chained and called segments up to, and including, the segment
identified by<I> lLastSegment</I>.
<P>
Data is returned for each tagged primitive that intersects the pick aperture.
The data returned for each "hit" (or correlation) consists of a set of segment
and tag pairs, starting with the correlated one and followed by the one
that called the segment. This is repeated until the root segment is reached
or<I> lMaxDepth</I> values are returned.
<P>
Only primitives with a nonzero tag (see <A HREF="2920_L2_GpiSetTag.html">GpiSetTag</A>)
in segments with a nonzero identifier are correlated using this function.
Primitives in segments called (to any depth in the hierarchy) from a segment
0 are not eligible for correlation.
<P>
The depth value specifies the number of sets of segment and tag pairs to
be returned for each hit. If the root segment is reached before<I> lMaxDepth
</I>values, the remaining values are set to zero. If more than<I> lMaxDepth
</I>values are available, only that number is returned.
<P>
The number of hits that occurred is returned in<I> lNumHits</I>.
<P>
A "hit" is an instance of a segment identifier and tag pair for which the
primitives lie completely or partially within the specified aperture. Two
different primitives in the same segment might have the same tag, and would
therefore produce the same hit. This is counted as a single hit; the hit
is recorded only once in the<I> plSegTag</I> parameter returned. The<I> lNumHits
</I>parameter, therefore, returns this distinct number of hits. Hits are
returned in reverse order of their occurrence.
<P>
<I>plSegTag</I> is set to the hits that are found, up to the maximum defined
in the<I> lMaxHits</I> parameter. Corresponding pairs of elements form the
hit pairs. The number returned by the call therefore contains the number
of sets of<I> lMaxDepth</I> pairs set if the<I> lMaxHits</I> parameter is
greater than the number of hits detected.  The number of elements set in
the<I> plSegTag</I> parameter is twice the number returned by the function
(subject to a maximum of<I> lMaxHits</I>) multiplied by the<I> lMaxDepth</I>.

<P>
If the<I> lNumHits</I> value returned by the function is greater than that
specified in<I> lMaxHits</I>, more hits occurred than could be returned.
If all hits are important, specify an array that is large enough to contain
the maximum number of sets of hits that are expected.
<P>
The draw controls (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>)
are ignored by this call.
<P>
It may be necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current
position, and viewing limits are reset to their default values, before processing
the segments. This can be done either ensuring that the first segment to
be correlated does not have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiCorrelateFrom. The latter method also resets the clip path to no clipping.

<P>
If this function is followed by primitives or attributes, without first
opening a segment, the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.

<P>
If<I> lFirstSegment</I> does not exist, or is not in the segment chain,
an error is raised. If<I> lLastSegment</I> does not exist, or is not in
the chain, or is chained before<I> lFirstSegment</I>, no error is raised
and processing continues to the end of the chain.
