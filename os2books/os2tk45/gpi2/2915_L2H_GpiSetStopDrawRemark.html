<P>
This function allows an application to set up, and control, an asynchronous
thread on which long drawing operations may be performed. At the point at
which the controlling thread stops a draw, it sets the "stop draw" condition.
The controlling thread clears this condition after it has received an acknowledgment
from the drawing thread.
<P>
The "stop draw" condition has no effect on any other calls.
<P>
If one of the following calls is made (or has already been initiated from
another thread) to the same presentation space, the call is terminated if
the "stop draw" condition exists:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

The call terminates with a warning.
<P>
Any call other than GpiSetStopDraw, directed at a presentation space that
is currently in use, gives a PMERR_PS_BUSY error condition.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If this function is issued when an asynchronous draw to a
metafile is taking place, the result is an unusable metafile.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
