<P>
Dynamic segments are those segments in the segment chain that have the ATTR_DYNAMIC
segment attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>).
 It is preferable to position dynamic segments at the start of the segment
chain.
<P>
Dynamic segments can either be drawn with this function, or by setting the
DCTL_DYNAMIC draw control (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>),
and issuing one of the other GpiDraw... calls.
<P>
If there is no range set by a previous <A HREF="2111_L2_GpiRemoveDynamics.html">GpiRemoveDynamics</A>,
all dynamic segments are redrawn by GpiDrawDynamics). However, if <A HREF="2111_L2_GpiRemoveDynamics.html">GpiRemoveDynamics
</A>specified a range in the segment chain, the redraw is restricted to
the dynamic segments that are in, or called from, the selected range. (See
<A HREF="2111_L2_GpiRemoveDynamics.html">GpiRemoveDynamics</A>).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The redraw is controlled by the calls set by previous calls
to <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>.
<P>
The "stop draw" condition can be set (from another thread) while GpiDrawDynamics
is in progress. This is useful in responding to a new position by setting
this condition, and then clearing it and redrawing at the new position.

<P>
If "Erase before draw" is set ON (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>),
the presentation space is erased before the redraw.
<P>
It may be necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current
position, and viewing limits are reset to their default values, before processing
the segments. This can be done either by ensuring that the first dynamic
segment to be drawn does not have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>),
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiDrawDynamics. The latter method also resets the clip path to no clipping,
which may also be necessary.
<P>
If this function is followed by primitives or attributes, without first
opening a segment, the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.
In particular, note that during GpiDrawDynamics, the system forces the foreground
mix to FM_XOR and the background mix to BM_LEAVEALONE. It may be necessary
to set one or both of these before starting to draw.
