<H1>GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2975 -->
<P>
This function is only valid outside segments.  The viewing transform that
is set applies to all subsequently opened (new) segments (it has no effect
on primitives outside segments). All graphics primitives in a segment must
have the same viewing transform. When it has been set for a particular segment,
the viewing transform for that segment cannot be changed.
<P>
The transform is specified as a one-dimensional array of<I> lCount</I> elements,
being the first n elements of a 3-row by 3-column matrix ordered by rows.
 The order of the elements is:
<PRE>  Matrix                   Array

ÚÄ       Ä¿
³ a  b  0 ³
³ c  d  0 ³          (a,b,0,c,d,0,e,f,1)
³ e  f  1 ³
ÀÄ       ÄÙ
</PRE>

<P>
The transform acts on the coordinates of the primitives in a segment, so
that a point with coordinates (x,y) is transformed to the point:
<PRE>(a*x + c*y + e, b*x + d*y + f)
</PRE>

<P>
The initial value of the viewing transform is the identity matrix, as shown
below:
<PRE>  Matrix                   Array

ÚÄ       Ä¿
³ 1  0  0 ³
³ 0  1  0 ³          (1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1)
³ 0  0  1 ³
ÀÄ       ÄÙ
</PRE>

<P>
The viewing transform must be set (or defaulted) to the unity transform,
before any segment that is to be called is first opened.
<P>
If scaling values greater than unity are given (which only applies if the
presentation space coordinate format, as set by the <A HREF="356_L2_GpiCreatePS.html">GpiCreatePS
</A>function, is GPIF_LONG) it is possible for the combined effect of this
and any other relevant transforms to exceed fixed-point implementation limits.
This causes an error.
<P>
This function must not be issued in a path or area bracket.
