<P>
Each character in the string is positioned so that its character reference
point is at the current position. The current position is advanced after
each character is drawn to give the position for the next character.
<P>
The characters in the character string are selected from the current character
set. The font from which the characters are selected depends on the current
character mode. For a description of which fonts are used for each of the
possible modes, see <A HREF="2383_L2_GpiSetCharMode.html">GpiSetCharMode</A>.

<P>
The degree to which approximation of the position and size of characters
is allowed, and also the area used during correlation of the character string,
is controlled by the character-mode attribute.
<P>
After the string has been drawn, the current position is set to the end
of the character string. This is the point at which the next character would
have been drawn, had it existed.
