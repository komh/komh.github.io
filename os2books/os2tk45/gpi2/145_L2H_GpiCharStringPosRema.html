<P>
A vector of increments can be specified, allowing control over the positioning
of each character after the first. This vector consists of distances measured
in world coordinates (along the baseline for left-to-right and right-to-left
character directions, and along the shearline for top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top
character directions). Increment<I> i</I> is the distance of the reference
point of character<I> i+1</I> from the reference point of character<I> i</I>.
The last increment may be needed to update the current position.
<P>
These increments, when specified, set the widths of each character.
<P>
A further option allows a rectangle to be specified that can be used as
the background of the string instead of the normal background. This rectangle
is painted using the current character background color and an overpaint
mix (unless this is in a dynamic segment, when leave-alone is used). Both
corners of the rectangle are specified, so that the rectangle is positioned
independently of the current position. Points on the borders of the rectangle
are considered to be included within the rectangle.
<P>
Clipping of the string to the rectangle is also allowed. This is independent
of whether the rectangle is actually drawn.
<P>
The current position can be updated to the point at which the next character
would have been drawn, had there been one, or it can be left at the start
of the string.
