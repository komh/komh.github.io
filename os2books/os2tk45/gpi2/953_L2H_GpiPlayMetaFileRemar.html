<P>
This function executes the contents of a metafile. This process is known
as "playing" the metafile. Whether the graphics are drawn, or retained in
segment store, or both, depends upon the current drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>)
in the presentation space, for the chained and unchained segment contexts,
as appropriate.  If chained segments are retained, they are added to the
end of any existing segment chain. An error is raised if a segment is to
be retained, and it has the same (nonzero) identifier as a currently existing
segment.
<P>
A segment must not be open when this function is issued. At the completion
of the call, there is no open segment.
<P>
The application may need to reset the presentation space by <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A>,
before issuing this function. Alternatively, the PMF_RESET option on this
function may be suitable.
<P>
Segments retain the segment attributes that they originally possessed.
