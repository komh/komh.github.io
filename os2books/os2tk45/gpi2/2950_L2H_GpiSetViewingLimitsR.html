<H1>GpiSetViewingLimits - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2961 -->
<P>
Viewing limits can be set within a segment, and apply to all subsequent
primitives in the segment and any segments it calls.  They can be changed
at any time within the segment and they are not subject to segment or model
transformations.  Limits specified in called segments override those set
by the limits of the root segment.
<P>
The limits are reset to their default value at the start of each root segment,
subject to the fast-chaining attribute, like primitive attributes. The initial
default value is no clipping; this can be changed with <A HREF="2525_L2_GpiSetDefViewingLimi.html">GpiSetDefViewingLimits</A>.

<P>
The boundaries are inclusive, so that points on them are not clipped (removed).
If either the left boundary of<I> prclLimits</I> is greater than the right,
or the bottom greater than the top, a NULL rectangle is defined.  All points
are clipped.
<P>
Attribute mode (see <A HREF="2227_L2_GpiSetAttrMode.html">GpiSetAttrMode</A>)
has no effect on this function.
<P>
The viewing limits are converted under the current viewing and default viewing
transformations to a clipping rectangle in the page. This remains in force
until changed by a subsequent GpiSetViewingLimits function. Clipping actually
takes place to the intersection of the viewing limits, the clip path, the
clip region, the graphics field, and the client area on the device.
