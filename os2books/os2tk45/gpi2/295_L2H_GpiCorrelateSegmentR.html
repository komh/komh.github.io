<H1>GpiCorrelateSegment - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 300 -->
<P>
Data is returned for each tagged primitive that intersects the pick aperture.
The data returned for each "hit" (or correlation) consists of a set of segment
and tag pairs, starting with the correlated one and followed by the one
that called that segment. This is repeated until the specified segment (which
was not called by another segment) is reached, or<I> lMaxDepth</I> values
are returned.
<P>
The specified segment identifier must be nonzero. Only primitives with a
nonzero tag (see <A HREF="2920_L2_GpiSetTag.html">GpiSetTag</A>) are correlated
using this function.
<P>
The depth value specifies the number of sets of segment and tag pairs to
be returned for each hit. If the specified segment is reached before<I> lMaxDepth
</I>values, the remaining values are set to zero. If more than<I> lMaxDepth
</I>values are available, only that number is returned.
<P>
The number of hits that occurred is returned in<I> lNumHits</I>.
<P>
A "hit" is an instance of a segment identifier and tag pair for which the
primitives lie completely or partially within the specified aperture. Two
different primitives in the same segment might have the same tag, and would
therefore produce the same hit. This is counted as a single hit; the hit
is recorded only once in the<I> alSegTag</I> parameter returned. The<I> lNumHits
</I>parameter, therefore, returns this distinct number of hits. Hits are
returned in reverse order of their occurrence.
<P>
<I>alSegTag</I> is set to the hits that are found, up to the maximum defined
in the<I> lMaxHits</I> parameter. Corresponding pairs of elements form the
hit pairs. The number returned by the function, therefore, contains the
number of sets of<I> lMaxDepth</I> pairs set if the<I> lMaxHits</I> parameter
is greater than the number of hits detected. The number of elements set
in the<I> alSegTag</I> parameter is twice the number returned by the function
(subject to a maximum of<I> lMaxHits</I>) multiplied by the<I> lMaxDepth</I>.

<P>
If the<I> lNumHits</I> value returned by the function is greater than that
specified in<I> lMaxHits</I>, more hits occurred than could be returned.
If all hits are important, specify an array that is large enough to contain
the maximum number of sets of hits that are expected.
<P>
The draw controls (see <A HREF="2536_L2_GpiSetDrawControl.html">GpiSetDrawControl</A>)
are ignored by this function. This function differs from the other GpiCorrelate...
functions because the segment to be correlated need not be a chained segment.

<P>
It may be necessary to ensure that attributes, model transform, current
position, and viewing limits are reset to their default values before processing
the segment. This can be done either by ensuring that the segment to be
correlated does not have the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute (see <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>)
or by issuing <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> before the
GpiCorrelateSegment. The latter method also resets the clip path to no clipping.

<P>
If this function is followed by primitives or attributes without first opening
a segment, the processing is as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.
