The most recently saved presentation space need not be the one that is restored.
 In this case, any that are skipped over on the stack are discarded.
<P>
Any clip regions selected into discarded presentation spaces are automatically
destroyed.

This function is valid in an open element bracket and in an open segment
bracket if the drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>)
is set to<B> draw</B> and within an open element bracket.  If it occurs
within an open area or path bracket, the corresponding <A HREF="2180_L2_GpiSavePS.html">GpiSavePS
</A>must have taken place earlier in the same bracket.
<P>
It is recommended that <A HREF="2180_L2_GpiSavePS.html">GpiSavePS</A> and
GpiRestorePS are used in pairs and are NOT split across page boundaries
in a multiple-page print job.
