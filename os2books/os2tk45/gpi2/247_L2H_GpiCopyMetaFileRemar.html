<P>
The source metafile must already be loaded or generated. It is identified
by a metafile handle. The new metafile is identified by a handle that is
returned by this function, so it may be used, for example, by <A HREF="942_L2_GpiPlayMetaFile.html">GpiPlayMetaFile</A>.

<P>
The new metafile is owned by the process from which this function is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists
when the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.

<P>
The maximum number of metafiles allowed for a given process depends on memory
construction and the application.
