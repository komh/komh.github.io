<H1>GpiCharStringAt - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->
<P>
The function GpiCharStringAt (hps, point, count, string) is equivalent to:

<PRE><A HREF="834_L2_GpiMove.html">GpiMove</A> (hps, point)
<A HREF="108_L2_GpiCharString.html">GpiCharString</A> (hps, count, string)
</PRE>

<P>
Each character in the string is positioned so that its character reference
point is at the current position. The current position is advanced after
each character is drawn to give the position for the next character.
<P>
The font from which the characters in the character string are selected
depends on the current character mode. For a description of which fonts
are used for each of the possible modes, see <A HREF="2383_L2_GpiSetCharMode.html">GpiSetCharMode</A>.

<P>
The degree to which approximation of the position and size is allowed, and
also the area used during correlation of the character string, is controlled
by the character-mode attribute.
<P>
After the string has been drawn, the current position is set to the end
of the character string. This is the point at which the next character would
have been drawn, had it existed.
