<P>
The clip path (bound in device coordinates when the path is defined) is
used for all subsequent drawing.
<P>
Any open figures within the path are closed automatically.
<P>
The boundaries of the area defined by the path are considered to be part
of the interior, so that a point on the boundary is not clipped.
<P>
The clip path is reset to no clipping (no path selected) at the start of
a root segment (subject to the fast chaining segment attribute), or when
a <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A> function is issued.
<P>
After a path is selected as the clip path, it cannot be reused for any other
purpose.  When it is superseded as the clip path, it is discarded.
