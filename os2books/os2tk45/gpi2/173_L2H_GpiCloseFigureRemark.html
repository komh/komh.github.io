<P>
The current figure is closed by a line drawn to the start point of the figure.

<P>
This function need not be used if the path is to be filled (see <A HREF="649_L2_GpiFillPath.html">GpiFillPath</A>),
or used as a clip path (see <A HREF="2419_L2_GpiSetClipPath.html">GpiSetClipPath</A>),
as any figures in the path that have not been closed are automatically closed
at that time. It should be used, however, for any closed figures within
paths that are subsequently to be stroked by <A HREF="821_L2_GpiModifyPath.html">GpiModifyPath
</A>or <A HREF="2969_L2_GpiStrokePath.html">GpiStrokePath</A>.
<P>
This function must not be used outside a path specification. In particular,
it must not be used within an area.
