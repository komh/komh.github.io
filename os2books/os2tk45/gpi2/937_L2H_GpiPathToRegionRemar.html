<P>
This function converts a path (originally defined by a series of GPI drawing
calls) to a region.  The new region can be operated on by the GPI region
calls; in particular <A HREF="189_L2_GpiCombineRegion.html">GpiCombineRegion
</A>can be used to combine it with another region.
<P>
This function should not be used in retain or draw-and-retain modes because
it does not cause graphics orders to be added to the current segment.
<P>
Any open figures within the path are closed automatically.
<P>
The boundaries of the area defined by the path are considered to be part
of the interior, so that a point on the boundary is included in the new
region.
<P>
After a path is converted to a region, it no longer exists as a path. The
path cannot be reused for any other purpose.
