<P>
The specified segment can be a segment that exists in the segment chain,
or an unchained segment.  The effect of this function on an unchained segment
is to add it to the segment chain in the specified position.
<P>
The application may redraw the picture by drawing the segment chain (see
<A HREF="517_L2_GpiDrawChain.html">GpiDrawChain</A>).  This causes the segments
in the chain to be processed from beginning to end, so that if segments
overlap, later ones are placed on top of earlier ones (assuming a default
mix mode) and therefore appear to have higher priority.  Changing the position
of the segment in the chain therefore has the effect of changing its priority
to the end user.
