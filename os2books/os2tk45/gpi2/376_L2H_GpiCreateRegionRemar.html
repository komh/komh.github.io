The new region is defined by the logical-OR of all of the rectangles specified.
Points on the right-hand and top boundaries are not included in the region.
Points on the left-hand and bottom boundaries, that are not also on the
right-hand or top boundaries (that is, the top-left and bottom-right corner
points), are included.
<P>
The region is owned by the process from which this function is issued. It
cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists when
the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.
