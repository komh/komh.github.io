<P>
Each time a primitive attribute call (such as color, or line type) is issued
and the attribute mode is set to AM_PRESERVE, the values are put into a
"Last in, First out" stack.
<P>
This function can reset the current attribute values (starting with the
last one set) to the previous value; this is known as "popping".  This allows
a called segment to change the values of the attributes, and allows them
to be restored on return to the caller (an implicit GpiPop function is performed
for each preserved attribute when returning from a called segment).
<P>
When inside an area or path definition, this function is only valid if the
attribute being popped is valid inside an area or path definition.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is not possible to check whether the attribute to be popped
is valid before issuing this function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
