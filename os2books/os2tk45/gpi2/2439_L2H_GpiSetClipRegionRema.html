<H1>GpiSetClipRegion - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2450 -->
<P>
While a region is in use as a clip region, the calls <A HREF="846_L2_GpiOffsetClipRegion.html">GpiOffsetClipRegion</A>,
<A HREF="638_L2_GpiExcludeClipRectan.html">GpiExcludeClipRectangle</A> and
<A HREF="728_L2_GpiIntersectClipRect.html">GpiIntersectClipRectangle</A> cause
it to be changed.  These changes persist after the region has been deselected.
The clip region cannot, however, be used for any other region operations,
nor can it be selected into any other presentation space as a clipping region,
until it is deselected.
<P>
The coordinates of the region are taken to be device coordinates within
the device context.
<P>
The previous clip region, if any, is converted to a region, and a handle
to it is returned.  This can be used in a subsequent GpiSetClipRegion to
reinstate the same clipping as before.  If no clip region exists, a null
handle is returned. It is the responsibility of the application to free
the previous clip region (if any) with <A HREF="489_L2_GpiDestroyRegion.html">GpiDestroyRegion</A>,
even if this region was not originally created explicitly by the application.
