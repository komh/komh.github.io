Any open figures within the path are closed.
<P>
The path is deleted when the interior has been drawn.
<P>
The boundaries of the area, as defined by the path, are considered to be
part of the interior and are included in the fill.
<P>
If the current drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>)
is<B> draw</B> or<B> draw-and-retain</B>, the interior is drawn on the currently
associated device. If the drawing mode is<B> retain</B>, this function is
stored in the current segment, and output occurs when the segment is subsequently
drawn in the usual way.
