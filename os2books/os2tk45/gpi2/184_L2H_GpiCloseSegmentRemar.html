<H1>GpiCloseSegment - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
Closing a segment does not delete the segment or affect the graphics primitives
that are drawn.
<P>
Any attributes that have been preserved (see the AM_PRESERVE option of <A HREF="2227_L2_GpiSetAttrMode.html">GpiSetAttrMode</A>)
are popped (restored) when the GpiCloseSegment function is issued in<B> draw
</B>or<B> draw-and-retain</B> modes, and at the end of the segment when
the segment is subsequently drawn in<B> draw-and-retain</B> or<B> retain
</B>modes (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>).

<P>
If an area or path is open when a segment is closed, the area or path is
terminated. When the drawing mode is<B> draw</B> or<B> draw-and-retain</B>,
a warning is given, but the close processing continues. No warning is given
for<B> retain</B> mode. If a retained segment with an open area or path
is drawn, an error occurs.
<P>
If an element bracket is open when a segment is closed, the element bracket
is first closed automatically.
<P>
If this function is followed by primitives or attributes, without first
opening a segment, the following may or may not have been reset to their
default values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current attribute values and arc parameters<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current tag<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current model transform<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current position<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current clip path and viewing limits.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any such quantity can be assumed to contain its default value only if it
is known either that it has not been changed from the default, or that last
time it was changed, it was set to its default value. An application should
not be written to depend on the values of these quantities immediately after
GpiCloseSegment.
<P>
Subsequent primitives, not preceded by an <A HREF="880_L2_GpiOpenSegment.html">GpiOpenSegment
</A>function, are not retained, irrespective of the current drawing mode.

<P>
The current viewing transform, however, is guaranteed to be reset to unity
for primitives outside segments.
