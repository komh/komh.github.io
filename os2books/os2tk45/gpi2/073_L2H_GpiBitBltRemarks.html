<P>
A rectangle of bit-map image data is copied from a bit map selected into
a device context associated with the source presentation space, to a bit
map selected into a device context associated with the target presentation
space. Alternatively, either presentation space may be associated with a
device context that specifies a suitable raster device, for example, the
screen.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In either case, both source and target device contexts must
apply to the same physical device. It is an error if this device does not
support raster operations.
<P>
Unless the device is a<I> banded</I> printer, both source and target may
refer to the same presentation space. If so, the copy is nondestructive
when source and target rectangles overlap.
<P>
A rectangle can be specified in device coordinates, for both source and
target. These rectangles are noninclusive; that is, they include the left
and lower boundaries in device space, but not the right and upper boundaries.
 Thus, if the lower-left maps to the same device pel as the upper-right,
that rectangle is considered to be empty.
<P>
If the upper-right source point is specified, and the source and target
rectangles are of different sizes, stretching, or compressing, or both,
of the data occurs.<I> flOptions</I> specifies how eliminated rows or columns
of bits are to be treated if compression occurs.  Note that the pattern
data is never stretched or compressed.
<P>
The following current attributes of the target presentation space are used
(other than for converting between monochrome and color, as described below):
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Area background color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern set<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pattern symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The color values are used in conversion between monochrome and color data.
 This is the only format conversion performed by this function.  The conversions
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Output of a monochrome pattern to a color device.

<P>
In this instance, the pattern is converted first to a color pattern using
the current area colors:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 1s -&gt; area foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 8 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>source
0s -&gt; area background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Copying
from a monochrome bit map to a color bit map (or device).
<P>
The source bits are converted as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 1s -&gt; image foreground color<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->source 0s -&gt; image background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Copying
from a color bit map to a monochrome bit map (or device).<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The image will be grey scaled under the current operation
of the device drivers, and the colors will be shades of grey corresponding
to a mapping scheme that the device driver uses. This behavior may vary
from one printer to another, depending on the printer's capabilities.
<P>
The only variance from this grey-scaling is that pure white (for example,
backgrounds) prints as black and pure black (for example, text) prints as
white.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In all of the above instances (except where the source image
background color is used) it is the attributes of the<I> target</I> presentation
space that are used.
<P>
If the mix (<I>lRop</I>) does not call for a pattern, the pattern set and
pattern symbol are not used. If it does not require a source (this is not
valid when<I> flOptions</I> is in the range 1 through 3),<I> hpsSource</I> is
not required and must be null. <B> Sx1,Sy1</B> is also ignored in this instance.

<P>
Neither the source nor the pattern is required when a bit map, or part of
a bit map, is to be cleared to a particular color.
<P>
If the mix does require both source and pattern, a three-way operation is
performed.
<P>
If a pattern is required, dithering may be performed for solid patterns
in a color that is not available on the device; see <A HREF="2775_L2_GpiSetPattern.html">GpiSetPattern</A>.

<P>
Support for the BM_SRCTRANSPARENT and BM_DESTTRANSPARENT background mix
options is provided by the CAPS_BACKGROUND_MIX_SUPPORT flags in DevQueryCaps.

<P>
Requesting the BM_SRCTRANSPARENT background mix option results in pels from
the source bit map matching the presentaton space background color, to not
be copied to the output bit map, effectively leaving those pels in the output
unchanged. This provides for a transparent overlay function.
<P>
Requesting the BM_DESTTRANSPARENT background mix option results in a transfer
such that pels from the source bit map will only be copied to<!-- entering slot 78 --> destination
pels that match the presentation space background color. This provides for
a transparent underlay function.
<P>
If any of the source data is not available (when, for example, the source
presentation space is connected to a screen window, and the source rectangle
is not totally visible), the contents of the unavailable parts are undefined.
This can be checked with <A HREF="2100_L2_GpiRectVisible.html">GpiRectVisible
</A>before calling this function.
<P>
This function is independent of drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>);
the effect always occurs immediately, and it is not retained even if the
drawing mode is<B> draw-and-retain</B> or<B> retain</B>. Its effect, however,
is recorded in a metafile, but note that this is successful only if the
metafile is replayed on a similar device, with<B> draw</B> drawing mode.

<P>
The current position in both source and target presentation spaces is unchanged
by this function.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function must not be used when creating SAA-conforming
metafiles; see "MetaFile Resolutions" in the<I> Presentation Manager Programming
Reference</I> for more information.
