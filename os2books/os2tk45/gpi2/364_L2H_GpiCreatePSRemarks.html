<P>
There are two types of presentation spaces:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Micro presentation space<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Normal presentation space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Only a restricted subset of calls is allowed to a micro presentation space;
the main difference is that graphic segments (primitives, attributes, and
so on) can be retained by the system, for subsequent redraw or editing,
in a normal presentation space, but not in a micro presentation space. However,
the storage and execution overheads are lower for a micro presentation space.

<P>
An initial association of the new presentation space with a device context
may be performed (this is mandatory for a micro presentation space), by
specifying GPIA_ASSOC.
<P>
When a presentation space is associated with a device context, either using
this function with GPIA_ASSOC, or explicitly with <A HREF="015_L2_GpiAssociate.html">GpiAssociate</A>,
a page viewport in device space is automatically constructed, to which the
page is mapped to form the device transform. The value of<I> PS_UNITS</I> and
the<I> psizlSize</I> parameter, are taken into account.
<P>
In general, the size parameter can be safely set to zeroes except when using
PU_ARBITRARY units.  In that case, use a size in device coordinates obtained
from DevQueryCaps. For units other than PU_PELS, a non-zero size can cause
a transform to be in effect for the resulting PS.
