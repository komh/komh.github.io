<H1>GpiGetData - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 717 -->
<P>
If the buffer is large enough to contain the data requested, the data is
returned and<I> lCount</I> is set to show its length.
<P>
If the buffer is not large enough, the buffer is filled and<I> lCount</I> is
set to the length of the buffer. This may mean that there is an incomplete
order at the end of the buffer; even so, it is possible to use <A HREF="1096_L2_GpiPutData.html">GpiPutData
</A>subsequently, without having to scan the orders in the buffer.
<P>
The application can detect when it has been given all the data by checking
the<I> lCount</I> value. If this is less than the value of<I> lLength</I> specified,
there is no more data to be returned. If it is equal, there is more data,
except in the case where the data just fits in the buffer, which is detected
if another GpiGetData function is issued, and a<I> lCount</I> of 0 is returned.

<P>
No conversion of coordinates is performed for the DFORM_NOCONV value of
the control parameter.  The coordinates are in the presentation space format.

<P>
This function can be issued while there is a segment open, unless the open
segment is the segment referenced by this function. If the segment referenced
by this function is open, an error occurs.
<P>
The segment transform and viewing transform are not returned by this call.
