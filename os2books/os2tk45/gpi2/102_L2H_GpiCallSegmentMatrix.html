<P>
The instance transform specified is a model transform that is used to modify
the current model transform, in a way that depends upon the value of the
<I>lOptions</I> parameter, before calling the segment.  This new transform
applies only to the called segment.  On return, it is reset to the model
transform in operation before the function was called.
<P>
The transform is specified as a one-dimensional array of elements, being
the first<I> lCount</I> elements of a 3-row by 3-column matrix ordered by
rows.  The order of the elements is:
<PRE>   Matrix                   Array

ÚÄÄ     ÄÄ¿
³ a  b  0 ³
³ c  d  0 ³          (a,b,0,c,d,0,e,f,1)
³ e  f  1 ³
ÀÄÄ     ÄÄÙ
</PRE>

<P>
A point with coordinates (x,y) is transformed to the point
<PRE>(a*x + c*y + e, b*x + d*y + f)
</PRE>

<P>
The called segment must have a unity transform for the viewing transform
(see <A HREF="2956_L2_GpiSetViewingTransfo.html">GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix</A>).

<P>
If scaling values greater than unity are given (which only applies if the
presentation space coordinate format as set by the <A HREF="356_L2_GpiCreatePS.html">GpiCreatePS
</A>function is GPIF_LONG), it is possible for the combined effect of this
and any other relevant transforms to exceed fixed-point implementation limits.
 This causes an error.
