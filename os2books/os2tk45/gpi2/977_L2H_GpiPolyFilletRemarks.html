<P>
If two points are supplied, an imaginary straight line is drawn from the
current position to the first point and a second straight line from the
first point to the second.  A curve is then constructed, starting at the
current position and tangential to the first straight line. The curve is
drawn such that it reaches the last point at a tangent to the second straight
line. Example A shows the curve constructed, given current position A and
the two points B and C.
<P>
If more than two points are supplied, a series of imaginary straight lines
is constructed through them (as in the <A HREF="1010_L2_GpiPolyLine.html">GpiPolyLine
</A>function). All of the straight lines except the first and last are then
divided in two at their mid-points. A series of curved fillets is then drawn,
each starting at the end point of the last, at one of the mid-points. Example
B shows the curve constructed, given current position A and three points
B, C, and D.
<P>
The current position is set to the last point.
<P>
Each individual fillet always lies within the area bounded by the start,
end, and control points.
<P>
It is not an error for any of the points to be coincident.
<P>
The maximum number of fillets allowed in the polyfillet is more than 4 000.
