<P>
This function determines whether a new element is to be inserted into a
segment, moving any subsequent elements further along the segment, or whether
a new element is to replace the current element.
<P>
In SEGEM_INSERT mode, when an element is generated, it is inserted following
the element indicated by the element pointer. The element pointer is updated
to point to the new element.
<P>
In SEGEM_REPLACE mode, when an element is generated, it replaces the element
indicated by the element pointer. The element pointer does not change. It
is an error if a new element is generated in SEGEM_REPLACE mode if the element
pointer is 0 (as it is when a segment is opened).
<P>
The editing mode can be changed at any time, (except while within an element
bracket), and is not an attribute of a specific segment.  It only applies
to the storing of data within retained segments. It is not an error to issue
this function in other drawing modes; the value of the edit mode is set
irrespective of the value of the draw mode.
<P>
This function is invalid within an element bracket. The default editing
mode (set by <A HREF="356_L2_GpiCreatePS.html">GpiCreatePS</A> or <A HREF="2133_L2_GpiResetPS.html">GpiResetPS</A>)
is SEGEM_INSERT.
