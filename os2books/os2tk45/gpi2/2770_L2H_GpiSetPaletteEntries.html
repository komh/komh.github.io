<P>
The changes made by this function do not become apparent until WinRealizePalette
is called, even for animating indices. Changes can be made more rapidly
using <A HREF="001_L2_GpiAnimatePalette.html">GpiAnimatePalette</A> with
animating indices, assuming that the hardware being used supports this.

<P>
GpiSetPaletteEntries can be called at any time to change a logical palette,
and the physical palette of the device will incorporate the changes as best
it can; however, the system cannot guarantee that a change will be realized
in the hardware palette, since realization depends on whether the associated
window is in the foreground and on the number of available hardware palette
entries.
<P>
All presentation spaces that have this palette selected into them (see <A HREF="2204_L2_GpiSelectPalette.html">GpiSelectPalette</A>),
are updated with the effects of this function.
<P>
If a palette is selected into a presentation space that is associated with
a device context of type OD_METAFILE or OD_METAFILE_NOQUERY only the final
color values are recorded in the metafile. This means that, while metafiling,
this function must only be used for incremental additions to the color table.

<P>
It is an error if a palette is selected into a presentation space that is
within an area or path definition when this function is issued.
