<P>
The currently open segment has an element pointer that points to a particular
element in the segment; each element is placed into the segment at the place
indicated by the pointer. When a retained segment is first opened, the element
pointer is set to 0 (empty segment). It is incremented each time a call
causes an element (a single API call) to be placed in the segment. When
a segment is reopened, the element pointer is reset to 0 (that is, before
the first element).
<P>
The element pointer for a segment is not remembered if the segment is closed
and subsequently reopened.
<P>
This function is only valid when the drawing mode (see <A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>)
is set to<B> retain</B> (not<B> draw-and-retain</B>), and a segment bracket
is currently in progress. It is invalid within an element bracket.
