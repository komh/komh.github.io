<P>
This function converts the path to one describing the envelope of a wide
line stroked using the current geometric wide-line attribute (see <A HREF="2663_L2_GpiSetLineWidthGeom.html">GpiSetLineWidthGeom</A>).
Note that this and <A HREF="2969_L2_GpiStrokePath.html">GpiStrokePath</A> are
the only calls that can cause geometric wide lines to be constructed.
<P>
The envelope includes the effects of line joins, and line ends, according
to the current values of these attributes (see <A HREF="2627_L2_GpiSetLineJoin.html">GpiSetLineJoin
</A>and <A HREF="2615_L2_GpiSetLineEnd.html">GpiSetLineEnd</A>). Note these
points:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A line may be joined to an arc, for example.  The
common point is handled according to the line-join attribute, rather than
applying line ends at each end.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any open figures within the path are not closed automatically.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a figure is closed using <A HREF="168_L2_GpiCloseFigure.html">GpiCloseFigure</A>,
the joining rules are followed, rather than the ending rules, at the start
and end point.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The envelope takes account of any crossings, so that
a character such as a stroked "X" does not have a hole in the middle when
subsequently drawn in exclusive-OR mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After this function, the only calls that can be performed on the path are
<A HREF="649_L2_GpiFillPath.html">GpiFillPath</A>, specifying the FPATH_WINDING
option, or <A HREF="2419_L2_GpiSetClipPath.html">GpiSetClipPath</A>, specifying
the SCP_WINDING  option.
