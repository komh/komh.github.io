<P>
A segment is a way of grouping graphics primitives.
<P>
If the current drawing mode is<B> retain</B> or<B> draw-and-retain</B> (see
<A HREF="2548_L2_GpiSetDrawingMode.html">GpiSetDrawingMode</A>), the following
occurs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a nonzero identifier is given, and if a segment
with the specified identifier does not already exist, a new retained segment
is created. If one does already exist, it is reopened in<B> retain</B> mode
(with the element pointer set to 0), but is an error in<B> draw-and-retain
</B>mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If an identifier of 0 is given, a new retained segment
is created, regardless of whether one with a 0 identifier already exists.
 There can be more than one segment with an identifier of 0, but such segments
can never subsequently be referenced by identifier. When they have been
created, they continue to exist until all segments are deleted. Zero segments
must be chained and cannot be defined as dynamic.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the current drawing mode is<B> draw</B>, a new nonretained segment is
started. No check is made against any possible retained segment identifiers.
The current attributes are set to default values (subject to the ATTR_FASTCHAIN
segment attribute; see below).
<P>
The initial attributes of the segment are as set by <A HREF="2603_L2_GpiSetInitialSegment.html">GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs</A>.
The attributes may subsequently be changed with <A HREF="2869_L2_GpiSetSegmentAttrs.html">GpiSetSegmentAttrs
</A>(except for a segment with an identifier of 0). It is an error to try
to open a new segment with a drawing mode of<B> draw</B> or<B> draw-and-retain</B>,
with the ATTR_DYNAMIC segment attribute.
<P>
This function causes a segment bracket to be started. While the bracket
is in effect, any primitive and attribute functions are considered to be
part of the segment, and are stored in it if the drawing mode is<B> retain
</B>or<B> draw-and-retain</B>. The bracket is terminated by a <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>.
It is an error if GpiOpenSegment is issued when a segment is already open.

<P>
The following actions occur when drawing of a chained segment is started
(either as it is passed across the API in<B> draw</B> or<B> draw-and-retain</B>,
or as it is found during a draw operation):<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Current attributes and arc parameters are reset to
default values.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The current tag
is reset to its default value.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Current model transform is reset to unity.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Current position is set to (0,0).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The current clip path is set so as to cause
no clipping.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The current viewing limits are reset to their
default values.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The current viewing transform is set either
to the value last set by <A HREF="2956_L2_GpiSetViewingTransfo.html">GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix</A>,
or to the default value if no <A HREF="2956_L2_GpiSetViewingTransfo.html">GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix
</A>function has been issued.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the segment has the ATTR_FASTCHAIN attribute, the application should
not depend upon whether or not these operations are performed. This avoids
complications when interchanging picture data with other implementations.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The current clip region is not changed by this function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
If any primitive/attribute calls are issued immediately before this function
(that is, outside a segment bracket), then any currently open area, path,
or element brackets are terminated, as described for <A HREF="179_L2_GpiCloseSegment.html">GpiCloseSegment</A>,
before the new segment is opened.
<P>
If the segment being defined is to be called from another segment (see <A HREF="093_L2_GpiCallSegmentMatrix.html">GpiCallSegmentMatrix</A>),
ensure that the viewing transform (see <A HREF="2956_L2_GpiSetViewingTransfo.html">GpiSetViewingTransformMatrix</A>)
is unity before first opening the segment.
<P>
The maximum number of retained segments allowed for a given presentation
space at any time is 16378.
