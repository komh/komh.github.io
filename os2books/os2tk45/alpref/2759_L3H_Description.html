<P>
The SHLD instruction shifts the first operand provided by the<B> r/m</B> field
to the left as many bits as specified by the count operand. The second operand
(<B>r16</B> or<B> r32</B>) provides the bits to shift in from the right
(starting with bit 0). The result is stored back into the<B> r/m</B> operand.
The register remains unaltered.
<P>
The count operand is provided by either an immediate byte or the contents
of the CL register. These operands are taken MODULO 32 to provide a number
between 0 and 31 by which to shift. Because the bits to shift are provided
by the specified registers, the operation is useful for multi-precision
shifts (64 bits or more). The SF, ZF and PF flags are set according to the
value of the result. The CF flag is set to the value of the last bit shifted
out. The OF and AF flags are left undefined.
