<H1>Message Numbers and Message Content</H1><!-- entering slot 2938 -->
<P>
Messages numbers displayed by ALP have the following format:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>ALPnnnn:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Message numbers always have a three-letter prefix that designates the component
issuing the message (<B>ALP</B>), followed by a four digit decimal number
given by<B> nnnn</B>.  All messages issued by the assembler are uniquely
numbered; however, not all messages displayed by the assembler will be accompanied
by a formatted message number (for instance, the assembler banner).
<P>
Messages issued during assembler initialization, command line processing,
or exception handling are numbered from 0 to 999.  Other messages occur
during input stream processing and are grouped according to their severity
type: 1000 through 1999 for fatal errors, 3000 through 3999 for regular
errors, 4000 through 4999 for warnings, and 5000 through 5999 for informational
messages.
<P>
It should be noted that messages are numbered for reference only; it is
not guaranteed that messages will be numbered identically for each subsequent
assembler release, or that individual messages will be retained or remain
unmodified in future releases.
