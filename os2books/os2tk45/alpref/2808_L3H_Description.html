<P>
The STI instruction sets the IF. The processor then responds to external
interrupts after running the next instruction if the next instruction allows
the IF flag to remain enabled. If external interrupts are disabled and the
STI instruction is followed by the RET instruction (such as at the end of
a subroutine), the RET instruction is allowed to run before external interrupts
are recognized. Also, if external interrupts are disabled and the STI instruction
is followed by a CLI instruction, which clears the IF flag, then external
interrupts are not recognized because the CLI instruction clears the IF
flag during its processing.
