<H1>ALP3203:  Can't take offset of expression</H1><!-- entering slot 2976 -->
<P>
The expression to which the OFFSET operator was applied did not contain
a constant or relocatable address.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> The offset operator may not be applied to register values.
 If the offset expression is applied to a quoted string, ensure that the
string length does not exceed the length of what is representable as a constant
value, given the word size of the enclosing segment (2 for USE16 segments,
4 for USE32 segments).
