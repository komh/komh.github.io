<H1>ALP0992:  Option "<option>" not valid in global scope</H1><!-- entering slot 2945 -->
<P>
An attempt was made to use an option in a situation that would cause ambiguities.
 As coded by the user, the option is only legal when applied to an individual
filename.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If the option syntax is correct, insure that it follows
the filename to which it applies.
