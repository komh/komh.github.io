<H1>ALP4202:  Invalid type expression; cannot convert</H1><!-- entering slot 3113 -->
<P>
Under MASM 5.10 emulation, a constant numeric expression may be used as
the left-hand operand of the PTR operator.  In the referenced expression,
the left-hand operand of the PTR operator did not evaluate to a value suitable
for use as the operand size of the right-hand operand.  The operand size
of the right-hand operator was not converted.
