<H1>ALP0004:  <signal> received, <assembler-name> is shutting down</H1><!-- entering slot 2940 -->
<P>
ALP has handled a request from the operating system to abort execution.
 The type of abort request is noted in the text of the message.  All open
files will be closed and any incomplete output files will be deleted.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If termination was requested by the user, no further action
is necessary.  Otherwise, the operating system may have sent an abort signal
because of insufficient system resources.
