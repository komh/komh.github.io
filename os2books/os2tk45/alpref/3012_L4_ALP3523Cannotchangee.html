<H1>ALP3523:  Cannot change expression word size</H1><!-- entering slot 3027 -->
<P>
After the expression word size was explicitly set with an OPTION EXPRxx
directive, an attempt was made to alter the setting with another OPTION
directive, or by switching to a 32-bit processor after an explicit OPTION
EXPR16 was issued.  Once set, the expression word size cannot be altered.
