<P>
ALP consists of two files:
<PRE>alp.exe
alp.msg
</PRE>

<P>
You can rename the root portions of the two file names if desired. In most
cases, it does not matter whether the file names are in upper- or lowercase
because the default OS/2 file systems disregard case.  It is possible, however,
that the use of an OS/2 Installable File System (IFS) might require that
file names be referenced exactly as they are named with respect to upper-
and lowercase.  If this is true, then the root portion of the<B> alp.exe
</B>and<B> alp.msg</B> file names (see <A HREF="008_L3_BaseEXE.html">BaseEXE</A>)
must be spelled identically and the<I> .msg</I> extension on the messages
file name must be specified in lowercase or the assembler will not be able
to find the messages file at run time.
<P>
To install ALP on OS/2:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy<B> alp.exe</B> into a directory of your
choice.  If the assembler will be invoked from the command line (rather
than by absolute reference from a makefile or command file), then the selected
directory should be among those referenced by the <A HREF="036_L3_PATH.html">PATH
</A>environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For best performance, the<B> alp.msg</B> file
should be copied into the same directory used in step 1 or in a directory
referenced by the <A HREF="033_L3_BaseEXE_PATH.html">&lt;BaseEXE&gt;_PATH
</A>environment variable.  It is not necessary to set any additional environment
variables if the first method is used.
<P>
Alternatively, a directory referenced by the <A HREF="034_L3_DPATH.html">DPATH
</A>environment variable may also be used, but performance may be degraded
during initialization, since the assembler must search all of the listed
directories for the<B> alp.msg</B> file.  See <A HREF="006_L2_TheALPMessagesFile.html">The
ALP Messages File</A> for more information.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Optionally, default values for command line options
may be established.  See <A HREF="032_L3_BaseEXE_OPTIONS.html">&lt;BaseEXE&gt;_OPTIONS
</A>for more information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
