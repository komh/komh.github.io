<P>
One of the following conditions has occurred:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The PUBLIC directive or keyword was used to export
an identifier, but the identifier has already been declared with attributes
that prevent it from being exported.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A PUBLIC directive was used on a procedure name, but
the PRIVATE keyword was used in the PROC directive that defined the procedure.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Verify that the identifier does not appear in a COMM or
EXTERN declaration, and that the identifier is a valid code or data label.
Insure that the PUBLIC declaration appears before the identifier it references,
and that the declaration is processed by the assembler on the first pass.
