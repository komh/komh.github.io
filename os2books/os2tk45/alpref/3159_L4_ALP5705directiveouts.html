<H1>ALP5705:  <directive> outside of segment boundaries</H1><!-- entering slot 3174 -->
<P>
This message appears when an external declaration (COMM or EXTRN) appears
outside of any enclosing segment.
<P>
If an external declaration is not enclosed in a segment definition that
describes how the external symbol is ultimately defined, the assembler is
deprived of segment attribute information; in particular, USE16 versus USE32.
 This could cause the assembler to generate incorrect object code, and may
also cause linker errors.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Place the external declaration within a segment definition
that correctly reflects the segment definition in the external module where
the symbol is defined.
