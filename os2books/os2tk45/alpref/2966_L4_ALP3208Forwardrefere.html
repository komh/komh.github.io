<H1>ALP3208:  Forward reference needs segment override or FAR PTR</H1><!-- entering slot 2981 -->
<P>
An expression contained a forward reference to a location that was later
determined to be of FAR distance.  When forward references are used, the
assembler makes default assumptions about the eventual definition of undefined
labels used in the expression; such definitions are never assumed to be
in a different segment.  Use of such an expression can cause differences
between the code generated on the first and second passes of the assembler.

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Qualify the expression with a distance override (FAR,
FAR16, or FAR32) or segment override (:) operator.
