<H1>Message Coordinates</H1><!-- entering slot 2936 -->
<P>
Message coordinates (if present) appear as the first field within a message,
and have one of two forms:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B><LI>Path]Filename(LLLL:CCCC):</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B><LI>Path]Filename(LLLL,Macroname(LLLL,CCCC)):</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Coordinates are displayed as part of a message if ALP is parsing an input
stream and the event which caused the message to be diplayed is directly
related to a specific location in the input.  The coordinates show the user
exactly where to look if action is required. The fact the ALP is parsing
an input stream does not mean that coordinates will appear in a message;
some messages may occur during parsing that are not a reference to the input
stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Filename
<P>
This is the name of the file containing the input token which caused the
message to be generated.  If this is the root source file whose name was
passed on the assembler command line, the file name will be displayed exactly
as specified by the user.  If this is an<B> INCLUDE</B> file, it will be
displayed exactly as specified in the<B> INCLUDE</B> directive, and the
path name where the file was searched for and found (if any) will be prepended
to the beginning.  ALP does not query the operating system in an attempt
to derive the full path name of a partially qualified file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Macroname
<P>
If the assembler is currently parsing tokens within a macro expansion, the
name of the macro currently being expanded will appear in the coordinates.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line Number (LLLL)
<P>
The first number in parentheses is the line number within the source file
where the referenced token is located; this refers to the<B><I> outer-most
point of invocation</B></I> if a macro name is also given in the message
coordinates.  A line number value appearing within parentheses following
a macro name refers to the<B><I> innermost point of expansion</B></I> (since
macro expansions may be nested) and references the original definition of
the macro.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Column Number (CCCC)
<P>
The second number in parentheses is the column number of the first character
of the referenced token within the source file or macro definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
