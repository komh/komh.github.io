The CMP instruction subtracts the second operand from the first but, unlike
the SUB instruction, does not store the result; only the flags are changed.
The CMP instruction is typically used in conjunction with conditional jumps
and the SETcc instruction. (Refer to Appendix D for the list of signed and
unsigned flag tests provided.) If an operand greater than one byte is compared
to an immediate byte, the byte value is first sign-extended.
