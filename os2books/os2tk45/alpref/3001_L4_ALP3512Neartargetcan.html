<H1>ALP3512:  Near target cannot be in different code segment</H1><!-- entering slot 3016 -->
<P>
A JMP or CALL instruction specified a near target that was defined in a
different segment, but the segments containing the instruction and the target
were not named together in a GROUP directive.  An instruction and its near
target cannot be in different segments (addressed by the CS register) at
run time.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If the instruction was otherwise properly coded, use the
GROUP directive to collect the segments together so that they will be accessible
at run time with the same CS register value.
