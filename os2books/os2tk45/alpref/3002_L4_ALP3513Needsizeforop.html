<H1>ALP3513:  Need size for operand</H1><!-- entering slot 3017 -->
<P>
The instruction operand list did not specify a size for the operation, and
the assembler is unable to select a default instruction encoding because
multiple variations exist.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> As size may be assigned to one or more of the operands
by using the &lt;type&gt; PTR override operator.
