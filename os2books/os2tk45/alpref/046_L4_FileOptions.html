<P>
All options appearing to the right of a file name within a given scope (see
<A HREF="047_L4_CommandLineScopeOper.html">Command Line Scope Operator ()</A>)
are applied to that file only.  File options take precedence over any settings
inherited from previously encountered group options.
<P>
It should be noted that file names specified using wild-card characters
and used in combination with file options may not yield the expected result;
the file options will be applied only to the last file in the resulting
wild-card expansion file name list.
