The IDIV instruction performs a signed division. The dividend, quotient,
and remainder are implicitly allocated to fixed registers. Only the divisor
is given as an explicit<B> r/m</B> operand. The type of the divisor determines
which registers to use as follows:

<P>
If the resulting quotient is too large to fit in the destination, or if
the divisor is 0, an Interrupt 0 is generated. Nonintegral quotients are
truncated toward 0. The remainder has the same sign as the dividend and
the absolute value of the remainder is always less than the absolute value
of the divisor.
