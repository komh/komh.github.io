<P>
Whenever ALP needs to search for one of its own component files (such as
the messages file), the value of the <A HREF="008_L3_BaseEXE.html">BaseEXE
</A>internal variable is translated to uppercase and is used to construct
the name of an ALP specific environment variable having the form "&lt;<A HREF="008_L3_BaseEXE.html">BaseEXE</A>&gt;<B>_PATH</B>."
 For example, if the value of <A HREF="008_L3_BaseEXE.html">BaseEXE</A> is
"alp," then an environment variable called<B> ALP_PATH</B> would be constructed
and an attempt would be made to locate it in the environment.  If found,
its contents would be expected to contain a list of directories in a format
identical to that of the standard <A HREF="036_L3_PATH.html">PATH</A> environment
variable.  ALP then searches this list of paths when attempting to locate
the component file.
