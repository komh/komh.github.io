<H1>ALP3753:  Name collision caused by promotion from inner scope</H1><!-- entering slot 3088 -->
<P>
During a definition of a structure (or union) type, a field identifier defined
at the outer (current) scope had the same name as a field defined in a promoted
inner scope (one created through the use of an unnamed imbedded structure).
 When a structure type is used to create an unnamed field within another
structure type, all of the field names from the inner structure are "promoted",
or made visible to the outer defining scope.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> One of the field identifier names must be altered to avoid
the name collision.  Alternatively, the unnamed imbedded structure may be
given an explicit field name, in which case its own fields are no longer
promoted, and fully-qualified references must be used to reach them from
within expressions.
