<H1>ALP3809:  Missing ENDM</H1><!-- entering slot 3098 -->
<P>
The preprocessor was reading the body of a macro definition when the end
of the current input stream was reached; the macro definition was never
closed with an ENDM keyword.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Verify that unexpected conditional assembly results are
not affecting the block structure of the program.  A macro definition may
not be closed in an input stream different from the one where it was started.
