<H1>LOCAL (Identify Names Local to a Macro Definition)</H1><!-- entering slot 701 -->
<P>
The<B> LOCAL</B> directive is used inside the body of a macro definition,
and provides a method of automatically generating unique assembler labels
each time the macro is expanded.  The names appearing in the argument list
of the<B> LOCAL</B> directive are known only to the enclosing macro, and
each time they are referenced during a macro expansion a unique symbol is
created.  This prevents the assembler from issuing duplicate definition
errors when the macro is expanded more than once and symbols contained therein
are being used to create assembler labels.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The<B> LOCAL</B> directive is recognized only within the body of a macro
given by a <A HREF="699_L3_MACROAssignaBodyofTe.html">MACRO</A>, <A HREF="696_L3_FORIRPIterativeMacro.html">FOR/IRP</A>,
<A HREF="697_L3_FORCIRPCIterativeMac.html">FORC/IRPC</A>, or <A HREF="703_L3_REPEATREPTIterativeM.html">REPEAT/REPT
</A>definition.  The symbols created by the preprocessor are of the form
<B>??nnnn</B>, where<B> nnnn</B> is a hexadecimal number in the range 0000
through FFFF.  You must avoid using identifiers of this form for your own
purposes, because doing so can cause duplicate definition errors.
<P>
To insure that they have the proper effect,<B> LOCAL</B> statements should
appear in the body of the macro before any other directives are used.  It
is acceptable for blank lines or comments to precede any<B> LOCAL</B> statements.

<P>
You can use multiple<B> LOCAL</B> statements if the argument list is too
long to fit on one line, or if you want a vertical list of<B> LOCAL</B> symbols.
