<H1>ALP4501:  Assuming NEAR distance for operand size</H1><!-- entering slot 3117 -->
<P>
A CALL or JMP instruction was coded to pass control indirectly through a
memory operand of indeterminate size.  When operating in MASM 5.10 emulation
mode, the memory operand is assumed to have the same size as address size
of the segment containing the CALL or JMP instruction, and implies a target
having NEAR distance.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> The memory operand should be given an explicit size, regardless
of whether or not the default address size and NEAR distance is the desired
operation.  This code will cause assembly errors if not assembled under
MASM 5.10 emulation mode.
