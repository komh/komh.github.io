<H1>ALP4502:  Can't ASSUME CS to a grouped segment</H1><!-- entering slot 3118 -->
<P>
An attempt was made to ASSUME the CS register to a segment that was previously
named in a GROUP directive.  This implies that the CS register might have
different values to access the same body of code at runtime.  This is illegal,
and the assembler altered the ASSUME operation to refer to the group containing
the segment instead.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If running the assembler under MASM 5.10 emulation, change
the ASSUME directive to refer to the group name containing the segment;
otherwise, remove the ASSUME statement.
