<H1>ALP5506:  Generated ASSUME CS:<signal></H1><!-- entering slot 3166 -->
<P>
This message is issued when an attempt is made to generate code in an open
segment for which there is no valid ASSUME CS in effect.  The assembler
automatically generates an ASSUME statement such that the CS register is
associated with the currently opened segment or with the group containing
that segment if one exists.
