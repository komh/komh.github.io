<P>
The RET instruction transfers control to a return address located on the
stack. The address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction,
and the return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL instruction.

<P>
The optional numeric parameter to the RET instruction gives the number of
stack bytes (OperandMode=16) or words (OperandMode=32) to be released after
the return address is popped. These items are typically used as input parameters
to the procedure called.
<P>
For the intrasegment (near) return, the address on the stack is a segment
offset, which is popped into the instruction pointer. The CS register is
unchanged. For the intersegment (far) return, the address on the stack is
a long pointer. The offset is popped first, followed by the selector.
<P>
In real mode, the CS and IP registers are loaded directly. In Protected
Mode, an intersegment return causes the processor to check the descriptor
addressed by the return selector. The AR byte of the descriptor must indicate
a code segment of equal or lesser privilege (or greater or equal numeric
value) than the current privilege level. Returns to a lesser privilege level
cause the stack to be reloaded from the value saved beyond the parameter
block.
<P>
The DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers can be cleared by the RET instruction
during an interlevel transfer. If there registers refer to segments that
cannot be used by the new privilege level, they are cleared to prevent unauthorized
access from the new privilege level.
