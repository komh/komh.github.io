<P>
When the destination is a 32-bit register, the 16-bit source operand is
copied into the lower 16 bits of the destination register, and the upper
16 bits of the register are undefined. With a 16-bit register operand, only
the lower 16 bits of the destination are affected (the upper 16 bits remain
unchanged). With a memory operand, the source is written to memory as a
16-bit quantity, regardless of operand size. As a result, 32-bit software
should always treat the destination as 16-bits and mask bits 16-31, if necessary.
