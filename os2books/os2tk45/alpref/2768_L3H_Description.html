<P>
The SHRD instruction shifts the first operand provided by the<I> r/m</I> field
to the right as many bits as specified by the count operand. The second
operand (<B><I>r16</B></I> or<B><I> r32</B></I>) provides the bits to shift
in from the left (starting with bit 31). The result is stored back into
the<I> r/m</I> operand. The register remains unaltered.
<P>
The count operand is provided by either an immediate byte or the contents
of the CL register. These operands are taken MODULO 32 to provide a number
between 0 and 31 by which to shift. Because the bits to shift are provided
by the specified register, the operation is useful for multi-precision shifts
(64 bits or more). The SF, ZF and PF flags are set according to the value
of the result. The CF flag is set to the value of the last bit shifted out.
The OF and AF flags are left undefined.
