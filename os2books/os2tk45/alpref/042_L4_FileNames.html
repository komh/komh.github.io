<P>
A file name may be used as an argument to certain command line options or
as a stand-alone command line parameter.  The file name character set and
naming conventions are operating system dependent, and are treated as transparently
as possible by ALP.  The use of operating system metacharacters in file
names should be avoided, and file names should not begin with the plus (+)
or minus (-) characters.
<P>
Any file name may be "qualified" with drive or path information as appropriate
for the host operating system.  ALP accepts both the forward slash (/) and
the backward slash (\) as legal path name characters, as well as the colon
(:) character.  Care must be exercised however, because the underlying operating
system may reject the usage of some of these characters.
