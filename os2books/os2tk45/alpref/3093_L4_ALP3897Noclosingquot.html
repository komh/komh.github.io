<H1>ALP3897:  No closing quote</H1><!-- entering slot 3108 -->
<P>
The preprocessor was parsing a quoted string literal, and the end of line
or other terminator was encountered before the literal was ended with a
closing quote character.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Verify that only single quotes ('') or double quotes ("")
are used to open and close a string literal; they must be used in pairs.
Verify that the ending quote character was not immediately preceded by another
identical quote character; the assembler interprets this sequence as a request
to insert a quote character into the string literal.
