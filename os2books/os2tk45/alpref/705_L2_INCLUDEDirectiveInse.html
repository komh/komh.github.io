<P>
The<B> INCLUDE</B> directive "stacks" the current source file and begins
reading tokens from the source file given by the <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>argument.  If you use the<B> INCLUDE</B> directive, you need not
repeat a sequence of statements that are common to several source files.

The assembler uses the following search order when attempting to open the
<B>INCLUDE</B> file:<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->If the <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>argument contains a fully qualified path name (one that begins with
a back slash or forward slash), then the assembler attempts to open the
file exactly as specified, and no other search is performed if the file
is not found.<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->If the <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>begins with a relative path name or contains no path information,
the assembler begins searching for the<B> INCLUDE</B> file by looking in
the directory of the source file that issued the<B> INCLUDE</B> directive.
<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->The assembler searches for <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName

the command line.<!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->

<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->Lastly, the assembler searches for <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>in the current directory.  If the named file is not found, the assembler
issues a fatal error message and the assembler is ended.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> In
no case does the assembler strip relative path information from the <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>when performing search steps 2 through 6.
<P>
When the file named in the<B> INCLUDE</B> directive is located, the assembler
opens it and assembles all of the statements contained therein until the
end of the file is reached.  The file is then closed and assembler resumes
in the original module at the line following the<B> INCLUDE</B> directive.

<P>
An<B> INCLUDE</B> file should not contain an <A HREF="721_L3_ENDDefineEndofModule.html">END
</A>assembler directive to denote the end of the included module; the assembler
closes the included module when its physical end of file is reached.
<P>
<B>INCLUDE</B> files may be nested to any reasonable level, and is limited
only by the operating system's ability to provide the necessary resources.
