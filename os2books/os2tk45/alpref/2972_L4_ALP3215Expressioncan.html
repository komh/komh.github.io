<H1>ALP3215:  Expression cannot be forward-referenced</H1><!-- entering slot 2987 -->
<P>
The referenced expression is used in a context where an undefined or forward-referenced
value prevents the assembler from completing the operation or generating
a reliable construct.  This is the case during the declaration of user-defined
types or where the value of the location counter will depend on the results
of the expression.
