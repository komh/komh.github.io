The two-byte register or memory operand of the VERR and VERW instructions
contains the value of a selector. The VERR and VERW instructions determine
whether the segment denoted by the selector is reachable from the current
privilege level and whether the segment is readable (VERR) or writable (VERW).
If the segment is accessible, the ZF flag is set; if the segment is not
accessible, the ZF flag is cleared. To set the ZF flag, the following conditions
must be met:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The selector must denote a descriptor within the bounds
of the table (GDT or LDT); the selector must be "defined."<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The selector must denote the descriptor of a code
or data segment (not that of a task state segment, LDT, or a gate).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For the VERR instruction, the segment must be readable.
For the VERW instruction, the segment must be a writable data segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the code segment is readable and conforming, the
descriptor privilege level (DPL) can be any value for the VERR instruction.
Otherwise, the DPL must be greater than or equal to (have less or the same
privilege as) both the current privilege level and the selector's RPL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The validation performed is the same as if the segment were loaded into
the DS, ES, FS, or GS register, and the indicated access (read or write)
were performed. The ZF flag receives the result of the validation. The selector's
value cannot result in a protection exception, enabling the software to
anticipate possible segment access problems.
