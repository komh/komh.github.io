<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An attempt was made to use an unsupported register
in an indirect memory expression (for example,<B> [AH]</B>).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An attempt was made to combine a register with other
terms to form an indirect memory expression, and the register was not enclosed
in square brackets [ ].<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A register argument was expected and correctly parsed
in an assembler directive, but the referenced register cannot be legally
used in this particular context.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
