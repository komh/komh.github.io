<H1>General-Purpose Register Association</H1><!-- entering slot 809 -->
<P>
A<B><I> General-Purpose-Register-Association</B></I> establishes an assembly-time
association between a <A HREF="128_L3_ProcessorRegisters.html"><I>General-Purpose-Register
</I></A>and a <A HREF="256_L2_TypeDeclarations.html"><I>Type-Declaration</I></A>.
 It allows the programmer to describe for the assembler what type of data
is being held in the general purpose register at program run-time.
<P>
This feature can be very useful when the programmer is treating a general-purpose
register as a "pointer" to a particular type of storage.  If this "pointer"
is being utilized many times in the program, (perhaps changing in value
but never in the type of data to which it points), the<B> ASSUME</B> directive
can be used to associate the register with the type of data to which it
points.  This frees the programmer from having to use an explicit <A HREF="467_L4_TypeConversionPTROpe.html">Type
Conversion (PTR Operator)</A> every time the register is used to access
memory.
<P>
A register may only be associated with a data type whose operand size matches
that of the register.  For instance, the following construct is illegal:

<PRE>    ASSUME EBX:BYTE          ; Error, EBX is a DWORD register
</PRE>

<P>
The most useful situation is for the register to contain a pointer to another
data type.  In this situation, the <A HREF="579_L4_IndirectionOperator.html">Indirection
([] Operator)</A> may be used store or retrieve data through the register
without the need for an explicit conversion operation:
<PRE>    ASSUME EDI:NOTHING             ; This is the assembler default setting
    MOV    [EDI], 1                ; What is the size supposed to be?
    MOV    byte ptr [EDI], 1       ; Fixes the problem, but this can get tiring
    ASSUME EDI:PTR BYTE            ; EDI is now a pointer to a byte
    MOV    [EDI], 1                ; assembler knows what to do with this now
    INC    [EDI]                   ; and this too
</PRE>

<P>
The following constructs are legal but not particularly useful since they
simply restate what is already known about the registers (the operand size),
and the assembler doesn't enforce a strict level of type checking against
register operands:
<PRE>    ASSUME ECX:SDWORD              ; Signed double-word matches size of ECX
    ASSUME EBX:DWORD               ; Unsigned double-word matches size of EBX
    MOV    ECX, 0FFFFEEEEh         ; Register type-checking is not strict
    MOV    EBX, -1                 ;   enough to flag these as errors
</PRE>

<P>
In fact, any data type that matches the size of the register may be used;
the assembler checks the sizes and reports mismatches, but effectively ignores
any settings that are not pointers to other types.  Consider the following
example:
<PRE>    STRUCT_T STRUCT
      One    BYTE 1
      Two    BYTE 2
      Three  BYTE 3
      Four   BYTE 4
    STRUCT_T ENDS

    ASSUME EBX:STRUCT_T            ; Ok, STRUCT_T is 4 bytes in size
    MOV    EBX, -1                 ; Legal, but not very meaningful...

    ; A more useful situation (given that EBX is now holding data of type
    ; STRUCT_T) would be for the assembler to allow the following notation:

    MOV    EBX, { 4, 3, 2, 1 }     ; Hypothetical (UNSUPPORTED!) syntax...

    ; It would also be nice at this point if the symbolic debugger could
    ; show us the value of EBX in the appropriate format, but the assembler
    ; does not support the emitting of context-sensitive symbolic debugging
    ; information.
</PRE>
