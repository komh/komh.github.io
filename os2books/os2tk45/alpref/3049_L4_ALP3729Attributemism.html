<H1>ALP3729:  Attribute mismatch during reopen of segment</H1><!-- entering slot 3064 -->
<P>
An existing segment was reopened using different or conflicting attributes.

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> All identically named SEGMENT directives must be declared
with the same attribute list.
<P>
If an address size attribute (USE16 or USE32) was not explicitly specified
in the SEGMENT directive, verify that the default segment word size was
not altered between segment declarations with a processor selection directive.
