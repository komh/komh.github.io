<H1>ALP3303:  Can't be preceded by data label</H1><!-- entering slot 3004 -->
<P>
The referenced token is either an instruction mnemonic or a user identifier
that appears after a label.
<P>
If the referenced token is an instruction mnemonic, then the preceding label
must be followed by a single colon (:) or double colon (::).  Data labels
may not be used to refer to instructions. Otherwise, it is invalid to have
two labels appearing in succession.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Check for misspellings in either identifier, and that
the identifiers were specified using the correct uppercase and lowercase
letters if case sensitive assembly is in effect.
