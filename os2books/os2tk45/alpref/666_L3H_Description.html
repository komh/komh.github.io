<P>
<B><I>Comments</B></I> are language elements that have significance only
to the programmer and not to the assembler.  Comments are effectively removed
from the input stream during the text preprocessing phase.
<P>
There are two classes of comments recognized by ALP:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Comments that start with a character sequence and
continue to the end of the line (<I>EndOfLine-Comment</I>)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Comments that start with a character sequence and
continue until the occurrence of another character sequence (<I>Block-Comment</I>).
 See the <A HREF="706_L2_COMMENTDirectiveProg.html">COMMENT</A> directive
for a description of <A HREF="706_L2_COMMENTDirectiveProg.html"><I>Block-Comment</I></A><I>s</I>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
There are two types of<I> EndOfLine-Comment</I><I>s</I><I>:</I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B><I>Macro-Comment</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B><I>Macro-Comments</B></I> (beginning with two semicolons) do not appear
in the listing output even when the .LALL directive is used.  Use of<I> Macro-Comments
</I>can significantly reduce the amount of memory workspace used by the
definition of a macro.  As a macro definition is read,<I> Macro-Comments
</I>are discarded and not entered into the macro definition, whereas<I> NonMacro-Comments
</I>are treated as normal text and are retained.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B><I> NonMacro-Comment
</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B><I>NonMacro-Comment</B></I> (beginning with a single semicolon) are preserved
in macro definitions and appear in the listing output during macro expansions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
