<H1>ALP3732:  Reserved symbol "<identifier>" cannot be created or modified</H1><!-- entering slot 3067 -->
<P>
An invalid operation was performed on a reserved identifier.  One of the
following conditions occured:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An attempt was made through an EQU (or =) directive
to alter the value of a predefined identifier.  Unless documented otherwise,
this is an illegal operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The assembler attempted the deferred creation of a
reserved symbol, but a user-defined identifier already exists with the same
name and has conflicting attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
