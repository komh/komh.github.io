<H1>Command Line Scope Operator ()</H1><!-- entering slot 47 -->
<P>
At any point on the command line, a new<B><I> scope</B></I> may be opened
using the scope operator ().  The scope operator effectively creates a new
logical command line whose contents are enclosed in parentheses and is parsed
in isolation from other scopes.  Any group options in effect at the time
the new scope is opened are inherited and applied to all files named within.
