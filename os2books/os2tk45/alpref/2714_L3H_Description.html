<P>
The SAL instruction (or its synonym, SHL) shifts the bits of the operand
upward. The high-order bit is shifted into the CF flag, and the low-order
bit is cleared.
<P>
The SAR and SHR instructions shift the bits of the operand downward. The
low-order bit is shifted into the CF flag. The effect is to divide the operand
by two. The SAR instruction performs a signed divide with rounding toward
negative infinity (not the same as the IDIV instruction); the high-order
bit remains the same. The SHR instruction performs an unsigned divide; the
high-order bit is cleared.
<P>
The shift is repeated the number of times indicated by the second operand,
which is either an immediate number or the contents of the CL register.
To reduce the maximum processing time, the Pentium processor does not allow
shift counts greater than 31. If a shift count greater than 31 is attempted,
only the bottom five bits of the shift count are used. (The 8086 uses all
eight bits of the shift count.)
<P>
The OF flag is affected only if the single-shift forms of the instructions
are used. For left shifts, the OF flag is cleared if the high bit of the
answer is the same as the result of the CF flag (i.e., the top two bits
of the original operand were the same); the OF flag is set if they are different.
For the SAR instruction, the OF flag is cleared for all single shifts. For
the SHR instruction, the OF flag is set for the high-order bit of the original
operand.
