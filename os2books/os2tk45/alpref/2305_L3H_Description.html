<P>
The IN instruction transfers a data byte or data word from the port numbered
by the second operand into the register (AL, AX, or EAX) specified by the
first operand. Access any port from 0 to 65535 by placing the port number
in the DX register and using an IN instruction with the DX register as the
second parameter. These I/O instructions can be shortened by using an 8-bit
port I/O in the instruction. The upper eight bits of the port address will
be 0 when 8-bit port I/O is used.
