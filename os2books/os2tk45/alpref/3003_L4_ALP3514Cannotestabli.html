<H1>ALP3514:  Cannot establish near target without ASSUME CS:</H1><!-- entering slot 3018 -->
<P>
When running the under MASM 5.10 emulation, the assembler requires the code
segment register (CS) to have an ASSUME setting for the currently opened
segment before it will allow the creation of explicit near code labels.

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Insert an "ASSUME CS:SegName" statement at the beginning
of the segment before the appearance of any near code labels.
