<P>
The<B> INCLUDELIB</B> directive is used to inform the linker that a library
file of a given name is to be used when attempting to resolve external references
declared by this module.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName</I></A> argument is parsed
as a contiguous string of arbitrary characters, and should constitute a
file name that is valid in the context where it will be used.  The <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>should be coded as a &lt;<I>text-literal</I>&gt; if it is to contain
embedded spaces or other special characters.
<P>
The assembler emits a special record into the object file which contains
the string of characters given by the <A HREF="658_L3_FileNames.html"><I>FileName
</I></A>entry.  This record instructs the linker to include the named library
file in its list of libraries to be searched during the process of resolving
external references.  The assembler attaches no other meaning to the object
file record, and it is up to the linker to interpret the file name for any
special meaning (such as search path information, file name extension, and
so on).
<P>
Use of this directive avoids the need to explicitly reference the library
name in a linker invocation parameter, and helps to avoid the problems that
can arise when such parameters are specified incorrectly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
