<P>
FRSTOR reloads the FPU state (environment and register stack) from the memory
area defined by the source operand. This data should have been written by
a previous FSAVE or FNSAVE instruction.
<P>
The FPU environment consists of the FPU control word, status word, tag word,
and error pointers (both data and instruction). The environment layout in
memory depends on both the operand size and the current operating mode of
the processor. The USE attribute of the current code segment determines
the operand size:  the 14-byte operand applies to a USE16 segment, and the
28-byte operand applies to a USE32 segment. Refer to the Intel documentation
for the environment layouts for both operand sizes in both real mode and
protected mode. (In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layout is used.) The
stack registers, beginning with ST and ending with ST(7), are in the 80
bytes that immediately follow the environment image. FRSTOR should be run
in the same operating mode as the corresponding FSAVE or FNSAVE.
