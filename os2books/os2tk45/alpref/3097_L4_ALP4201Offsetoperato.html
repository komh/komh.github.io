<H1>ALP4201:  Offset operator applied to register-indirect expression</H1><!-- entering slot 3112 -->
<P>
An OFFSET operator was applied to a register-indirect expression.  In MASM
5.10 emulation mode this does not cause conversion to an immediate expression;
instead the register-indirect addressing mode attributes are retained, and
the assembler applies the OFFSET operator to the displacement field, forcing
it to have the size of the address offset. Applying the OFFSET operator
to a register-indirect expression is illegal if the assembler is not operating
under MASM 5.10 emulation.
