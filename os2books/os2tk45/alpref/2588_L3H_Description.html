The OUT instruction transfers a data byte or data word from the register
(AL, AX, or EAX) given as the second operand to the output port numbered
by the first operand. Output to any port from 0 to 65535 is performed by
placing the port number in the DX register and then using an OUT instruction
with the DX register as the first operand. If the instruction contains an
eight-bit port ID, that value is zero-extended to 16-bits.
