<P>
The index of the selected bit can be given by the immediate constant in
the instruction or by a value in a general register. Only an 8-bit immediate
value is used in the instruction. This operand is taken modulo 32, so the
range of immediate bit offsets is 0..31. This allows any bit within a register
to be selected. For memory bit strings, this immediate field gives only
the bit offset within a word or doubleword.
<P>
Immediate bit offsets larger than 31 are supported by some assemblers by
using the immediate bit offset field in combination with the displacement
field of the memory operand. In this case, the low-order 3 to 5 bits (3
for 16-bit operands, 5 for 32-bit operands) of the immediate bit offset
are stored in the immediate bit offset field, and the high-order bits are
shifted and combined with the byte displacement in the addressing mode by
the assembler. The processor will ignore the high-order bits if they are
not zero.
<P>
When accessing a bit in memory, the processor may access four bytes starting
from the memory address given by:   Effective Address + (4 * (BitOffset
DIV 32))
<BR>

<P>
for a 32-bit operand size, or two bytes starting from the memory address
given by:   Effective Address + (2 * (BitOffset DIV 16))
<BR>

<P>
for a 16-bit operand size. It may do this even when only a single byte needs
to be accessed in order to get at the given bit. You must therefore be careful
to avoid referencing areas of memory close to address space holes. In particular,
avoid references to memory-mapped I/O registers. Instead, use the MOV instructions
to load from or store to these addresses, and use the register form of these
instructions to manipulate the data.
