<P>
Run the AAS instruction only after a SUB instruction that leaves the byte
result in the AL register. The lower nibbles of the operands of the SUB
instruction must have been in the range of 0 through 9 (BCD digits). In
this case, the AAS instruction adjusts the AL register so it contains the
correct decimal digit result. If the subtraction produced a decimal carry,
the AH register is decremented, and the CF and AF flags are set. If no decimal
carry occurred, the CF and AF flags are cleared, and the AH register is
unchanged. In either case, the AL register is left with its top nibble set
to 0. To convert the AL result to an ASCII result, follow the AAS instruction
with OR AL, 30H.
