<P>
The CLTS instruction clears the task-switched (TS) flag in the CR0 register.
This flag is set by the processor every time a task switch occurs. The TS
flag is used to manage processor extensions as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Every processing of an ESC instruction is trapped
if the TS flag is set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Processing of a WAIT instruction is trapped if the
MP flag and the TS flag are both set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Thus, if a task switch was made after an ESC instruction was begun, the
floating-point unit's context may need to be saved before a new ESC instruction
can be issued. The fault handler saves the context and clears the TS flag.

<P>
The CLTS instruction appears in operating system software, not in application
programs. It is a privileged instruction that can only be run at privilege
level 0.
