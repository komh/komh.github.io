<H1>Assembly Language Processor (ALP) Overview</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
The Assembly Language Processor (ALP) is an assembler that runs under OS/2
Warp.  ALP is a functional replacement for the Microsoft Macro Assembler
(MASM) and accepts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The full syntax of the Intel 80X86 architecture<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The full syntax of the MASM 5.10 high-level directive
language<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A subset of the MASM 6.00 high-level directive language
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
ALP generates standard Object Module Format (OMF) files that can be linked
to produce DOS or OS/2 executables. It can also generate symbolic debugging
information compatible with the IBM family of source code debuggers.  A
MASM 5.10-compatible command line utility (MASM2ALP) is also provided to
enable use of ALP with little or no change to existing build environments.

<P>
ALP also offers a rich set of command line options, as well as a comprehensive
listing output cabability that is highly configurable, allowing a visual
perspective not possible with other assemblers.
