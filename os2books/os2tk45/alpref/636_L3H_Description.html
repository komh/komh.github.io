<P>
The literal-text operator directs the assembler to treat<I> Char-Sequence
</I>as a single literal element regardless of whether it contains commas,
spaces, or other separators. The operator is most often used with macro
calls and the FOR directive to ensure that values in a parameter list are
treated as a single parameter.
<P>
The literal-text operator can also be used to force ALP to treat other special
characters such as the semicolon (;) or the ampersand (&amp;) literally.
 For example, the semicolon inside angle brackets (&lt;;&gt;) becomes a
semicolon, not a comment indicator.
<P>
ALP removes one set of angle brackets each time the parameter is used in
a macro.  When using nested macros, you will need to supply as many sets
of angle brackets as there are levels of nesting.  The assembler recognizes
nested occurrences of text literals.
