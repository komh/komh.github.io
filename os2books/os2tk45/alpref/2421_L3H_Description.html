<P>
The LGDT and LIDT instructions load a linear base address and limit value
from a six-byte data operand in memory into the GDTR or IDTR, respectively.
If a 16-bit operand is used with the LGDT or LIDT instruction, the register
is loaded with a 16-bit limit and a 24-bit base, and the high-order eight
bits of the six-byte data operand are not used. If a 32-bit operand is used,
a 16-bit limit and a 32-bit base is loaded; the high-order eight bits of
the six-byte operand are used as high-order base address bits.
<P>
The SGDT and SIDT instructions always store into all 48 bits of the six-byte
data operand. With the 16-bit processors, the upper eight bits are undefined
after the SGDT or SIDT instruction is run. With the 32-bit processors, the
upper right eight bits are written with the high-order eight address bits,
for both a 16-bit operand and a 32-bit operand. If the LGDT or LIDT instruction
is used with a 16-bit operand to load the register stored by the SGDT or
SIDT instruction, the upper eight bits are stored as zeros.
<P>
The LGDT and LIDT instructions appear in operating system software; they
are not used in application programs. They are the only instructions that
directly load a linear address (i.e., not a segment relative address) in
Protected Mode.
