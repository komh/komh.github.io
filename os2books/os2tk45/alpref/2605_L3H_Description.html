<P>
The POP instruction replaces the previous contents of the memory, the register,
or the segment register operand with the word on the top of the processor
stack, addressed by SS:SP (address-size attribute of 16 bits) or SS:ESP
(address-size attribute of 32 bits). The stack pointer SP is incremented
by 2 for an operand-size of 16 bits or by 4 for an operand-size of 32 bits.
It then points to the new top of stack.
<P>
The POP CS instruction is not a processor instruction. Popping from the
stack into the CS register is accomplished with a RET instruction.
<P>
If the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, or SS),
the value popped must be a selector. In protected mode, loading the selector
initiates automatic loading of the descriptor information associated with
that selector into the hidden part of the segment register; loading also
initiates validation of both the selector and the descriptor information.

<P>
A null value (0000-0003) may be popped into the DS, ES, FS, or GS register
without causing a protection exception. An attempt to reference a segment
whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a null value causes
a #GP(0) exception. No memory reference occurs. The saved value of the segment
register is null.
<P>
A POP SS instruction inhibits all interrupts, including NMI, until after
processing of the next instruction. This allows sequential processing of
POP SS and MOV eSP, eBP instructions without danger of having an invalid
stack during an interrupt. However, use of the LSS instruction is the preferred
method of loading the SS and eSP registers.
<P>
A POP-to-memory instruction, which uses the stack pointer (ESP) as a base
register, references memory after the POP. The base used is the value of
the ESP after the instruction runs.
<P>
Loading a segment register while in protected mode results in special checks
and actions, as described in the following listing: IF SS is loaded:
<BR>
  IF selector is null THEN #GP(0);
<BR>
  Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits ELSE
<BR>
   #GP(selector);
<BR>
  Selector's RPL must equal CPL ELSE #GP(selector);
<BR>
  AR byte must indicate a writable data segment ELSE #GP(selector);
<BR>
  DPL in the AR byte must equal CPL ELSE #GP(selector);
<BR>
  Segment must be marked present ELSE #SS(selector);
<BR>
  Load SS register with selector;
<BR>
  Load SS register with descriptor;
<BR>

<BR>
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with non-null selector:
<BR>
  AR byte must indicate data or readable code segment ELSE
<BR>
   #GP(selector);
<BR>
  IF data or nonconforming code
<BR>
  THEN both the RPL and the CPL must be less than or equal to DPL in
<BR>
  AR byte
<BR>
  ELSE #GP(selector);
<BR>
  FI;
<BR>
  Segment must be marked present ELSE #NP(selector);
<BR>
  Load segment register with selector;
<BR>
  Load segment register with descriptor;
<BR>

<BR>
IF DS, ES, FS, or GS is loaded with a null selector:
<BR>
  Load segment register with selector
<BR>
  Clear valid bit in invisible portion of register
<BR>
