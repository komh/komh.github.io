<P>
An expression is a sequence of<I> operators</I> and<I> operands</I> that
are evaluated to derive a numeric result, an effective address, or a register
operand.
<P>
Expressions are specified using standard infix notation, which is recursive
in nature, ie., expressions may be nested within other expressions.  The
evaluation of an expression occurs in a left to right manner, and is influenced
by the rules of operator<I> precedence</I> and<I> associativity</I>.  The
order in which expressions are evaluated can be controlled by grouping operands
and operators together using parentheses ().
