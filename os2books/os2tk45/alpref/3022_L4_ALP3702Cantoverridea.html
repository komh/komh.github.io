<H1>ALP3702:  Can't override array with single item</H1><!-- entering slot 3037 -->
<P>
Within a structure variable instantiation, an incorrect attempt was made
to override the default initializer of a structure member.  The structure
member was defined to be of type<I> array</I> (having been initialized with
a character string or list of expressions enclosed in brackets), and the
overriding expression in the structure instantiation was a single numeric
expression.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Array members can only be overridden using a quoted character
string or a bracketed list of numeric expressions.
