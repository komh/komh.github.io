The CBW instruction converts the signed byte in the AL register to a signed
word in the AX register by extending the most significant bit of the AL
register (the sign bit) into all of the bits of the AH register. The CWDE
instruction converts the signed word in the AX register to a doubleword
in the EAX register by extending the most significant bit of the AX register
into the two most significant bytes of the EAX register. Note that the CWDE
instruction is different from the CWD instruction. The CWD instruction uses
the DX:AX register pair rather than the EAX register as a destination.
