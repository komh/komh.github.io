<H1>ALP3226:  Expression must have structure or union type</H1><!-- entering slot 2998 -->
<P>
The expression to the left of a structure member selection operator (.)
did not have a structure or union type.  The assembler cannot evaluate the
member expression to the right of the selection operator unless the left
hand operand has an associated structure or union type.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If the left hand operand must be something other than
an explicit structure or union variable (such as a register-indirect expression
like [EBX]), then use the PTR operator to convert the left hand operand
to the appropriate type.
