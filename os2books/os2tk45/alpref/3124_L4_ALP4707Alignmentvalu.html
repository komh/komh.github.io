<H1>ALP4707:  Alignment value not valid with current segment alignment</H1><!-- entering slot 3139 -->
<P>
The referenced alignment factor was less than the alignment factor specified
in the SEGMENT declaration containing the ALIGN statement. This condition
is illegal because the assembler cannot guarantee that the linker will not
invalidate the requested alignment when it exercises its right to position
the entire segment according to the alignment factor given in the enclosing
SEGMENT declaration.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This condition is allowed to exist as a warning under MASM
5.10 emulation for backward compatibility with existing source files.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Respecify either the aligment factor or the SEGMENT delaration
so that the segment alignment is greater than or equal to any alignment
factor requested therein.
