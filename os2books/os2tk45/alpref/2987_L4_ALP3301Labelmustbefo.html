<H1>ALP3301:  Label must be followed by a directive</H1><!-- entering slot 3002 -->
<P>
A user identifier appeared in the label field, but the end of line was encountered
before an assembler directive was specified to give the label a definition.

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Code labels must be followed by a single colon (:) or
double colon (::) on the same line as the label itself. Named assembler
directives must appear on the same line as the associated label, or the
line continuation (\) character must follow the label to create a single
logical line.
<P>
Check for a possible misspelled identifier or keyword.  Verify that the
identifier was specified using the correct uppercase and lowercase letters
if case sensitive assembly is in effect.
