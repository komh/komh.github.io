<H1>Segment Register Association</H1><!-- entering slot 808 -->
<P>
A<B><I> Segment-Register-Association</B></I> establishes an assembly-time
association between a <A HREF="128_L3_ProcessorRegisters.html"><I>Segment-Register
</I></A>and an expression that resolves to a <A HREF="168_L4_GroupName.html"><I>GroupName
</I></A>or <A HREF="176_L4_SegmentName.html"><I>SegmentName</I></A>.  It
allows the programmer to describe for the assembler what values are held
in the segment registers at program run-time.
<P>
When the user program executes, all instructions that access memory do so
through a particular segment register.  To generate the correct encoding
for an instruction that accesses a memory location, the assembler must know
which segment register will be used in the effective memory address.  In
general, accessing a memory location from within a user program is done
by referencing a named variable defined within a particular named segment.

<P>
Before accessing a named program variable (in a named memory segment), it
is the programmer's responsibility to insure that the desired segment register
actually references the correct physical segment at program run-time.  Unless
the<B> ASSUME</B> directive is used to describe this association, the assembler
has no way of knowing<I> which</I> segment register (if any) is addressing
a named segment when a reference to a named variable contained therein is
encountered.  In this situation, the programmer is forced to use the <A HREF="473_L4_SegmentOverrideOpera.html">Segment
Override (: Operator)</A> in every instruction to "reach" the desired variable
and cause the assembler to generate the proper instruction encoding.  The
association established by the<B> ASSUME</B> directive allows the assembler
to take over the task of verifying memory references and generating the
appropriate instructions.
<P>
If you temporarily use a segment register to contain a value other than
the segment or group identified in the<B> ASSUME</B> association, then you
should reflect the change with a new<B> ASSUME</B> statement, or cancel
the association with an<B> ASSUME xS:NOTHING</B> construct.
<P>
When the contents of a segment register are used for addressability, the
register value should never contradict the association established for that
register.
<P>
When the <A HREF="784_L3_MODELDefineProgramMe.html">.MODEL</A> directive
is utilized and the program is designed to follow the conventions that it
establishes, the<B> ASSUME</B> directive is no longer needed in most cases.

Code  SEGMENT
      ASSUME NOTHING       ; Cancel all register assumptions
      mov ax,Data          ; Load general-purpose register with segment frame,
      mov DS,ax            ;   then establish addressablity through DS
      mov ES,ax            ;   and ES.  The assembler doesn't "know" this yet
      mov Stuff, 1         ; Error, can't reach Stuff
      ASSUME ES:Data       ; Associate ES register with Data segment
      add Stuff, bx        ; Now we can reach Stuff, but the assembler needs
                           ;   to generate an ES override instruction byte
      ASSUME DS:SEG Stuff  ; Expression to extract the segment value of Stuff
                           ;   This has the same effect as ASSUME DS:Data
                           ;   Now both DS and ES are associated with Data
      add Stuff, cx        ; This time, the instruction doesn't need an
                           ;   override byte because DS is the default
                           ;   register for normal accesses to memory
      ASSUME DS:NOTHING    ; Cancel the association between DS and Data
      add Stuff, dx        ; Once again, the ES override is generated
      add DS:Stuff, dx     ; Must use "force" if we want the default encoding

<P>
If an<B> ASSUME CS</B>:<A HREF="261_L2_ExpressionSyntax.html"><I>Expression
</I></A>is placed before the code segment it is referencing, the assembler
will ignore the<B> ASSUME</B>.  The<B> ASSUME CS</B>:<A HREF="261_L2_ExpressionSyntax.html"><I>Expression
</I></A>statement must follow the<B> SEGMENT</B> definition statement of
the code segment it is referencing.
<P>
The<B> ASSUME</B> statement for the<B> CS</B> register should be placed
immediately following the code <A HREF="786_L3_SEGMENTOpenaProgramI.html">SEGMENT
</A>statement, before any labels are defined in that code segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
