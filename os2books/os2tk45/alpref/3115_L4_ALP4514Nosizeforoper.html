<H1>ALP4514:  No size for operand, assuming default</H1><!-- entering slot 3130 -->
<P>
This message indicates that no operand size was given for the instruction,
but the assembler was able to infer an operand size from the instruction
itself.  This message is only issued when the assembler is operating under
MASM 5.10 emulation.  In this mode, a default operand size is associated
with certain processor mnemonics; this default value is used when no explicit
operand size is given.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> An explicit operand size should be given for the referenced
expression because the assembler is automatically resolving a potentially
dangerous ambiguity in its selection of a default operand size.
