<P>
The MUL instruction performs unsigned multiplication. Its actions depend
on the size of its operand, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A byte operand is multiplied by the AL value; the
result is left in the AX register. The CF and OF flags are cleared if the
AH value is 0; otherwise, they are set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A word operand is multiplied by the AX value; the
result is left in the DX:AX register pair. The DX register contains the
high-order 16-bits of the product. The CF and OF flags are cleared if the
DX value is 0; otherwise, they are set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A doubleword operand is multiplied by the EAX value
and the result is left in the EDX:EAX register. The EDX register contains
the high-order 32-bits of the product. The CF and OF flags are cleared if
the EDX value is 0; otherwise, they are set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
