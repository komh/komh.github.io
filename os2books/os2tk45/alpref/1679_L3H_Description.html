<P>
The CMPS instruction compares the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to by
the source-index register with the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to
by the destination-index register.
<P>
If the address-size attribute of this instruction of 16-bits, the SI and
DI registers will be used for source- and destination-index registers; otherwise
the ESI and EDI registers will be used. Load the correct index values into
the SI and DI (or ESI and EDI) registers before running the CMPS instruction.

<P>
The comparison is done by subtracting the operand indexed by the destination-index
register from the operand indexed by the the source-index register.
<P>
Note that the direction of subtraction for the CMPS instruction is [SI]
- [DI] or [ESI] - [EDI]. The left operand (SI or ESI) is the source and
the right operand (DI or EDI) is the destination. This is the reverse of
the usual Intel convention in which the left operand is the destination
and the right operand is the source.
<P>
The result of the subtraction is not stored; only the flags reflect the
change. The types of the operands determine whether bytes, words, or doublewords
are compared. For the first operand (SI or ESI), the DS register is used,
unless a segment override byte is present. The second operand (DI or EDI)
must be addressable from the ES register; no segment override is possible.

<P>
After the comparison is made, both the source-index register and destination-index
register are automatically advanced. If the DF flag is 0 (a CLD instruction
was run), the registers increment; if the DF flag is 1 (an STD instruction
was run), the registers decrement. The registers increment or decrement
by 1 if a byte is compared, by 2 if a word is compared, or by 4 if a doubleword
is compared.
<P>
The CMPSB, CMPSW and CMPSD instructions are synonyms for the byte, word,
and doubleword CMPS instructions, respectively.
<P>
The CMPS instruction can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for block
comparison of CX or ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. Refer to the description
of the REP instruction for more information on this operation.
