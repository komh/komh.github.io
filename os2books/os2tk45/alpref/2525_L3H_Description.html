<P>
The MOVS instruction copies the byte or word at [(E)SI] to the byte or word
at ES:[(E)DI]. The destination operand must be addressable from the ES register;
no segment override is possible for the destination. A segment override
can be used for the source operand; the default is the DS register.
<P>
The addresses of the source and destination are determined solely by the
contents of the (E)SI and (E)DI registers. Load the correct index values
into the (E)SI and (E)DI registers before running the MOVS instruction.
The MOVSB, MOVSW, and MOVSD instructions are synonyms for the byte, word,
and doubleword MOVS instructions.
<P>
After the data is moved, both the (E)SI and (E)DI registers are advanced
automatically. If the DF flag is 0 (the CLD instruction was run), the registers
are incremented; if the DF flag is 1 (the STD instruction was run), the
registers are decremented. The registers are incremented or decremented
by 1 if a byte was moved, 2 if a word was moved, or 4 if a doubleword was
moved.
<P>
The MOVS instruction can be preceded by the REP prefix for block movement
of ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for details of this
operation.
