<H1>Listing Control Options</H1><!-- entering slot 69 -->
<P>
This section describes all options related to controlling the content of
the assembler listing file.  All listing control options begin with the
letter<B> "L"</B>.
<P>
Options that manipulate the characteristics of individual listing file columns
reference a particular column by having a single character mnemonic identifier
as part of the option identifier.  Listing column mnemonics are as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>C</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> Conditional assembly nesting level</B> is
a numeric value that appears during processing of a conditional assembly
directive and is incremented for each level of nesting that occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> D
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Macro definition line number</B> tracks line
numbers for each new MACRO definition introduced into the assembly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> F
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>True or false conditional flag</B> appears
during processing of a conditional assembly directive and is either a plus
(+) character to denote that the conditional expression was TRUE and tokens
appearing within the block are being interpreted, or a minus (-) character
to denote that the conditional expression was FALSE and tokens appearing
within the block are being ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> G</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> Generated
machine code data</B> column shows the hexadecimal values for data generated
by machine instructions or data allocation statements.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> I
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Include file nesting level</B> is a numeric
value that appears during processing of INCLUDE files and is incremented
for each level of nesting that occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> L</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> Macro
expansion indentation level</B> is a text field whose width reflects the
current nesting level of expanded macros, and whose value contains a simulated
"arrow" using the "---&gt;" characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> M</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> Macro
expansion nesting level</B> is a numeric value that appears during macro
expansions and is incremented for each level of nesting that occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> O
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Location counter offset value</B> is a numeric
value displayed in hexadecimal notation and indicates the current offset
of the location counter within the current segment or structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> S
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Source line data</B> column contains the
text data of the current line in the input source file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> X
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Cumulative listing line number</B> is incremented
for every new line that appears in the listing file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Y
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B>Individual source file line number</B> tracks
line numbers for the top-level source file and for each separate INCLUDE
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Z</B><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> Macro
expansion line number</B> tracks the current line number for each MACRO
expanded during the assembly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
