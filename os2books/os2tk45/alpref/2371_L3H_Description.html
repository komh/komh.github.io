<P>
The JMP instruction transfers control to a different point in the instruction
stream without recording return information.
<P>
The action of the various forms of the instruction are shown below.
<P>
Jumps with destinations of type<I> r/m16, r/m32, rel16,</I>, and<I> rel32
</I>are near jumps and do not involve changing the segment register value.

<P>
The JMP<I> rel16</I> and JMP<I> rel32</I> forms of the instruction add an
offset to the address of the instruction following the JMP to determine
the destination. The<I> rel16</I> form is used when the instruction's operand-size
attribute is 16-bits (segment size attribute 16 only);<I> rel32</I> is used
when the operand-size attribute is 32-bits (segment size attribute 32 only).
The result is stored in the 32-bit EIP register. With<I> rel16</I>, the
upper 16-bits of the EIP register are cleared, which results in an offset
whose value does not exceed 16-bits.
<P>
The JMP<I> r/m16</I> and JMP<I> r/m32</I> forms specify a register or memory
location from which the absolute offset from the procedure is fetched. The
offset fetched from<B> r/m</B> is 32-bits for an operand-size attribute
of 32-bits (<I>r/m32</I>), or 16-bits for an operand-size attribute of 16-bits
(<I>r/m16</I>).
<P>
The JMP<I> ptr16:16</I> and<I> ptr16:32</I> forms of the instruction use
a four-byte or six-byte operand as a long pointer to the destination. The
JMP<I> m16:16</I> and<I> m16:32</I> forms fetch the long pointer from the
memory location specified (indirection). In Real Address Mode or Virtual
8086 Mode, the long pointer provides 16-bits for the CS register and 16
or 32-bits for the EIP register (depending on the operand-size attribute).
In Protected Mode, both long pointer forms consult the Access Rights (AR)
byte in the descriptor indexed by the selector part of the long pointer.
Depending on the value of the AR byte, the jump will perform one of the
following types of control transfers:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A jump to a code segment at the same privilege level
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A task switch<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For more information on protected mode control transfers, refer to the Intel
documentation.
