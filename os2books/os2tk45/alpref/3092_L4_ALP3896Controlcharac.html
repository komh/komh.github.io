<H1>ALP3896:  Control character illegal in this context</H1><!-- entering slot 3107 -->
<P>
A COMMENT preprocessor directive was encountered, and an attempt was made
to scan for the next character which signifies the beginning and end of
the comment text, but an unexpected non-printable control character was
encountered instead.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Only characters that are representable as printable text
may be used to open and close a COMMENT sequence.
