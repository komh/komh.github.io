<H1>ALP4510:  Truncation of significant bits in immediate value</H1><!-- entering slot 3126 -->
<P>
One of the following conditions occurred:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An operand expression was encoded into the instruction
as an immediate value, but the magnitude of the numeric expression exceeded
the number of bits required to store it in instruction encoding; the value
was truncated to fit in the allotted space.
<P>
Since the assembler uses 32-bit arithmetic during expression processing,
operations such as negation or logical inversion of small numeric quantities
can result in values that require all 32 bits of precision.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A relocatable immediate expression was converted to
a smaller type, thus affecting the type of the relocation record generated
for resolution by the linker.  This could happen if an offset expression
was forced into a byte sized storage space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Use the &lt;type&gt; PTR override to explicitly convert
the expression to a value of the proper size.
