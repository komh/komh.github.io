<H1>ALP3217:  Record tag expected</H1><!-- entering slot 2989 -->
<P>
A left-hand identifier operand was followed by a right-hand expression list
operand enclosed in angle brackets or braces.  The construct was parsed
as a record constant, but could not be evaluated because the left-hand operand
was not a record tag name previously defined with the RECORD directive.
