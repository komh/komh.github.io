<H1>ALP3506:  Register combination invalid with <number>-bit expression</H1><!-- entering slot 3010 -->
<P>
For 80386 processors or greater, both 16-bit and 32-bit effective addresses
are supported, but the two modes differ in the register combinations that
are allowed for indirect addressing.  The expression used a combination
that was invalid for the referenced address size.
<P>
For expressions that refer to 16-bit (USE16) memory locations, only a single
base register (BX or BP) and/or a single index register (DI or SI) may be
used.
<P>
For expressions that refer to 32-bit (USE32) memory locations, only a single
base register (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESP, EBP, EDI, ESI) and/or a single index
register (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, EDI, ESI) may be used; no single register
may appear more than once in a given expression.
