<P>
FREM produces an exact result; the precision (inexact) exception does not
occur and the rounding control has no effect.
<P>
The FPREM instruction is not the remainder operation specified in IEEE Std
754. To get that remainder, the FPREM1 instruction should be used. FPREM
is supported for compatibility with the 8087 and Intel287 math coprocessors.

<P>
FPREM works by iterative subtraction, can reduce the exponent of ST by no
more than 63 in one execution. If FPREM succeeds in producing a remainder
that is less than the modulus, the function is complete and the C2 flag
is cleared. Otherwise, C2 is set, and the result in ST is called the<I> partial
</I>remainder. The exponent of the partial remainder is less than the exponent
of the original dividend by at least 32. Software can run the instruction
again (using the partial remainder in ST as the dividend) until C2 is cleared.
A higher-priority interrupting routine that needs the FPU can force a context
switch between the instructions in the remainder loop.
<P>
An important use of FPREM is to reduce the arguments of periodic functions.
When reduction is complete, FPREM provides the three least-significant bits
of the quotient in flags C3, C1, and C0. This is important in argument reduction
for the tangent function (using a modulus of Ï€/4), because it locates the
original angle in the correct one of eight sectors of the unit circle.
