<P>
The ADC instruction performs an integer addition of the two operands DEST
and SRC and the carry flag, CF. The result of the addition is assigned to
the first operand (DEST), and the flags are set accordingly. The ADC instruction
is usually run as part of a multi-byte or multi-word addition operation.
When an immediate byte value is added to a word or doubleword operand, the
immediate value is first sign-extended to the size of the word or doubleword
operand.
