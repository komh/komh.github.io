<P>
The<B> []</B> binary operator performs a subscripting (or<I> indexing</I>)
operation between the operand to the left of the brackets and the operand
enclosed within the brackets.  This is a simple additive operation of<B> BYTE
</B>granularity; the arithmetic performed is not influenced by the <A HREF="593_L4_OperandSize.html"><I>Operand
Size</I></A> of either operand.
<P>
The syntax for this operator describes a binary operation between the left
hand expression and the bracketed expression.  The bracketed expression
is also subject to the same operations performed during the processing of
a standalone <A HREF="579_L4_IndirectionOperator.html"><I>Indirected-Expression
</I></A>as described in the section on <A HREF="509_L3_PrimaryExpression.html"><I>Primary-Expression</I></A><I>s</I>.
