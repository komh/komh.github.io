<H1>ALP3725:  Phase error between passes</H1><!-- entering slot 3060 -->
<P>
The address assigned to a label on pass one of the assembler had a different
value on the second pass.
<P>
This usually indicates that a forward reference to a label was not fully
qualified, and the eventual definition of the label was different than what
was assumed by the assembler on the first pass.  On the second pass, the
assembler did not need to make any assumptions about the attributes of the
symbol, but the resulting generation of object code caused a discrepancy
in the value of the location counter.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Use the listing control command line options to request
a listing for both pass one and pass two of the assembler; use this listing
to compare location counter values prior to the point where the phase error
occurred.  This will reveal the instruction that caused the location counter
to become unsynchronized.
