<P>
INVD should be used with care. It does not write back modified cache lines;
therefore, it can cause the data cache to become inconsistent with other
memories in the system. Unless there is a specific requirement or benefit
to invalidate a cache without writing back the modified lines (i.e., testing
or fault recovery where cache coherency with main memory is not a concern),
software should use the WBINVD instruction.
<P>
This instruction is implementation-dependent; its function may be implemented
differently on future Intel processors.
<P>
It is the responsibility of hardware to respond to the external cache write-back
and flush indications.
<P>
This instruction is not supported on Intel386 processors. See the Intel
documentation for information on detecting the processor type at runtime.
See the Intel documentation for information on disabling the cache.
