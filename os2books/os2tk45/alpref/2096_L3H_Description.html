Sets the operating mode of the 80287 to Protected Virtual-Address mode.
 When the 80287 is first initialized following hardware RESET, it operates
in Real-Address mode, just as does the 80286 CPU.  Once the 80287 NPX has
been set into Protected mode, only a hardware RESET can return the NPX to
operation in Real-Address mode.
<P>
When the 80287 operates in Protected mode, the NPX exception pointers are
represented differently than they are in Real-Address mode (see the FSAVE
and FSTENV instructions).  This distinction is evident primarily to writers
of numeric exception handlers, however.  For general application programmers,
the operating mode of the 80287 need not be a concern.
