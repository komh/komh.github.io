<P>
FXTRACT (extract exponent and significand) performs a superset of the IEEE-recommended
<B>logb</B>(<I>x</I>) function.
<P>
If the original operand is zero, FXTRACT leaves -ì in ST(1) (the exponent)
while ST is assigned the value zero with a sign equal to that of the original
operand. The zero-divide exception is raised in this case, as well.
<P>
ST(7) must be empty to avoid the invalid-operation exception.
<P>
FXTRACT is useful for power and range scaling operations. Both FXTRACT and
the base 2 exponential instruction F2XM1 are needed to perform a general
power operation. Converting numbers in extended-real format to decimal representations
(e.g., for printing or displaying) requires not only FBSTP but also FXTRACT
to allow scaling that does not overflow the range of the extended format.
FXTRACT can also be useful for debugging, because it allows the exponent
and significand parts of a real number to be examined separately.
