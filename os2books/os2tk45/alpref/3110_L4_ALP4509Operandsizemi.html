<H1>ALP4509:  Operand size mismatch</H1><!-- entering slot 3125 -->
<P>
One of the following conditions occurred:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An attempt was made within a data allocation directive
to initialize an item with an expression having an explicit and different
size.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A memory operand with an explicit size was used in
conjunction with a register operand, but two operand sizes did not match.
 The register operand size overrides the size of the memory operand.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A memory operand with an explicit size was used in
conjunction with an address offset.  The size of the memory operand and
the size implied by the address size of the offset value did not match.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
