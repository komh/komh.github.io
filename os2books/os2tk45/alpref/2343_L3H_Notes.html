<P>
INVD should be used with care. It does not write back modified cache lines;
therefore, it can cause the data cache to become inconsistent with other
memories in the system. Unless there is a specific requirement or benefit
to invalidate a cache without writing back the modified lines (i.e., testing
or fault recovery where cache coherency with main memory is not a concern),
software should use the WBINVD instruction.
<P>
This instruction is implementation-dependent; its function may be implemented
differently on future Intel processors.
<P>
This instruction does not wait for the external cache to complete its invalidation
before the processor proceeds. It is the responsibility of hardware to respond
to the external cache invalidation indication.
<P>
This instruction is not supported on Intel386 processors. See the Intel
documentation for CPUID detection at runtime. See the WBINVD description
to write back dirty data to memory.
<P>
See the Intel documentation for information on disabling the cache.
