<H1>ALP3522:  Selected processor does not support this instruction</H1><!-- entering slot 3026 -->
<P>
A mnemonic or mnemonic/operand combination has been used that is not supported
by the processor for which the assembler is currently generating object
code.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Verify that the correct target processor has been selected
with one of the processor selection directives, or that the correct instruction
form has been coded.  Since ALP does not perform some of the same implicit
conversions that MASM 5.10 does, use of the &lt;type&gt; PTR conversion
operator may be required to avoid certain type-mismatch problems.
