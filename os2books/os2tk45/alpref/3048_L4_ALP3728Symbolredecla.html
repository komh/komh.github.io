<H1>ALP3728:  Symbol redeclared relative to different segment</H1><!-- entering slot 3063 -->
<P>
A data label or near code label appearing in an external declaration was
redeclared in a different segment (or outside of segment boundaries) and
conflicts with a previous declaration or definition.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Data labels or near code labels appearing within segment
boundaries must not reappear within the boundaries of a different segment.
 Labels appearing outside of segment boundaries inherit the default address
size (USE16 or USE32), and must not reappear within a segment having a conflicting
address size.
