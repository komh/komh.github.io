<P>
When ALP is invoked, if the full path name of the ALP executable was provided
by the operating system, then the "base" portion is isolated and used to
construct the value of the<B> BaseEXE</B> internal variable.  For instance,
if the user invoked ALP and the name of the executable was made available
as "C:\TOOLS\ALP.EXE", then the<B> BaseEXE</B> internal variable would contain
the value "ALP".  The value of<B> BaseEXE</B> is used to differentiate ALP-specific
components in the environment (such as data files or environment variables)
from those that are globally accessible to all programs. Even multiple versions
of ALP can coexist without environmental "collisions" simply by copying
and renaming the ALP executable and its associated message file.
<P>
If the file name of the ALP executable is<B> not</B> available at run time,
then the value of<B> BaseEXE</B> defaults to "ALP".
