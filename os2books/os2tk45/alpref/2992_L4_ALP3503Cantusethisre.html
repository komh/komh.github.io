<H1>ALP3503:  Can't use this register with scale factor</H1><!-- entering slot 3007 -->
<P>
In an indirect memory expression, the scaling operator (*) was applied to
a register for which the processor does not support a scaling operation.

<P>
A scaling factor may only be used on 80386 or later processors, and only
in 32-bit address expressions.  Within this context, only the EAX, EBX,
ECX, EDX, EDI, ESI, and EBP registers are valid.  A scaling factor may not
be applied to the ESP register.

<P><HR>
