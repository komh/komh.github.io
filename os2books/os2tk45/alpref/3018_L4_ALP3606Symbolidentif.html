<H1>ALP3606:  Symbol "<identifier>" was never defined</H1><!-- entering slot 3033 -->
<P>
An identifier was declared with a GROUP or PUBLIC directive, but was never
given a full definition.  This condition prevents the assembler from writing
the appropriate records to the output object file.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Segments declared in a GROUP directive must defined in
a SEGMENT directive.  Identifiers declared with the PUBLIC directive must
be defined as a code label, data label, or absolute symbolic constant.
