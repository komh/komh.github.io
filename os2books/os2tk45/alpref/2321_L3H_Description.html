<P>
The INS instruction transfers data from the input port numbered by the DX
register to the memory byte or word at ES:dest-index. The memory operand
must be addressable from the ES register; no segment override is possible.
The destination register is the DI register if the address-size attribute
of the instruction is 16-bits, or the EDI register if the address-size attribute
is 32-bits.
<P>
The INS instruction does not allow the specification of the port number
as an immediate value. The port must be addressed through the DX register
value. Load the correct value into the DX register before running the INS
instruction.
<P>
The destination address is determined by the contents of the destination
index register. Load the correct index into the destination index register
before running the INS instruction.
<P>
After the transfer is made, the DI or EDI register advances automatically.
If the DF flag is 0 (a CLD instruction was run), the DI or EDI register
increments; if the DF flag is 1 (an STD instruction was run), the DI or
EDI register decrements. The DI register increments or decrements by 1 if
a byte is input, by 2 if a word is input, or by 4 if a doubleword is input.

<P>
The INSB, INSW and INSD instructions are synonyms of the byte, word, and
doubleword INS instructions. The INS instruction can be preceded by the
REP prefix for block input of CX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction
for details of this operation.
