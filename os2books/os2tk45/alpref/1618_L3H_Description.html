<P>
The CALL instruction causes the procedure named in the operand to be run.
When the procedure is complete (a return instruction is run within the procedure),
processing continues at the instruction that follows the CALL instruction.

<P>
The action of the different forms of the instruction are described below.

<P>
Near calls are those with destination of type<I> r/m16, r/m32, rel16, rel32</I>;
changing or saving the segment register value is not necessary. The CALL
<I>rel16</I> and CALL<I> rel32</I> forms add a signed offset to the address
of the instruction following the CALL instruction to determine the destination.
The<I> rel16</I> form is used when the instruction's operand-size attribute
is 16-bits;<I> rel32</I> is used when the operand-size attribute is 32-bits.
The result is stored in the 32-bit EIP register. With<I> rel16</I>, the
upper 16-bits of the EIP register are cleared, resulting in an offset whose
value does not exceed 16-bits. CALL<I> r/m16</I> and CALL<I> r/m32</I> specify
a register or memory location from which the absolute segment offset is
fetched. The offset fetched from<I> r/m</I> is 32-bits for an operand-size
attribute of 32 (<I>r/m32</I>), or 16-bits for an operand-size of 16 (<I>r/m16</I>).
The offset of the instruction following the CALL instruction is pushed onto
the stack. It will be popped by a near RET instruction within the procedure.
The CS register is not changed by this form of CALL.
<P>
The far calls, CALL<I> ptr:16</I> and CALL<I> ptr16:32</I>, use a four-byte
or six-byte operand as a long pointer to the procedure called. The CALL
<I>m16:16</I> and<I> m16:32</I> forms fetch the long pointer from the memory
location specified (indirection). In Real Address Mode or Virtual 8086 Mode,
the long pointer provides 16-bits for the CS register and 16 or 32-bits
for the EIP register (depending on the operand-size attribute). These forms
of the instruction push both the CS and IP or EIP registers as a return
address.
<P>
In Protected Mode, both long pointer forms consult the AR byte in the descriptor
indexed by the selector part of the long pointer. Depending on the value
of the AR byte, the call will perform one of the following types of control
transfers:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A far call to the same protection level<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An inter-protection level far call<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A task switch<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A CALL-indirect-thru-memory, which uses the stack pointer (ESP) as a base
register, references memory before the CALL. The base used is the value
of the ESP before the instruction runs.
<P>
For more information on Protected Mode control transfers, refer to the Intel
documentation.
