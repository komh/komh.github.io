<P>
The LODS instruction loads the AL, AX, or EAX register with the memory byte,
word, or doubleword at the location pointed to by the source-index register.
After the transfer is made, the source-index register is automatically advanced.
If the DF flag is 0 (the CLD instruction was run), the source index increments;
if the DF flag is 1 (the STD instruction was run), it decrements. The increment
or decrement is 1 if a byte is loaded, 2 if a word is loaded, or 4 if a
doubleword is loaded.
<P>
If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16-bits, the SI register
is used for the source-index register; otherwise the address-size attribute
is 32-bits, and the ESI register is used. The address of the source data
is determined solely by the contents of the ESI or SI register. Load the
correct index value into the SI register before running the LODS instruction.
The LODSB, LODSW, and LODSD instructions are synonyms for the byte, word,
and doubleword LODS instructions.
<P>
The LODS instruction can be preceded by the REP prefix; however, the LODS
instruction is used more typically within a LOOP construct, because further
processing of the data moved into the EAX, AX, or AL register is usually
necessary.
