<P>
The CPUID instruction provides information to software about the vendor,
family, model, and stepping of microprocessor on which it is running. An
input value loaded into the EAX register for this instruction indicates
what information should be returned by the CPUID instruction.
<P>
Following processing of the CPUID instruction with a zero in EAX, the EAX
register contains the highest input value understood by the CPUID instruction.
For the Pentium processor, the value in EAX will be a one. Also included
in the output of this instruction with an input value of zero in EAX is
a vendor identification string contained in the EBX, EDX, and ECX registers.
EBX contains the first four characters, EDX contains the next four characters
and ECX contains the last four characters. For Intel processors, the vendor
identification string is "GenuineIntel" as follows:
<PRE>EBX  756e6547h (* "Genu", with G in the low nibble of BL *)
EDX  49656e69h (* "ineI", with i in the low nibble of DL *)
ECX  6c65746eh (* "ntel", with n in the low nibble of CL *)
</PRE>

<P>
Following processing of the CPUID instruction with an input value of one
loaded into the EAX register, EAX[3:0] contains the stepping id of the microprocessor,
EAX[7:4] contains the model (the first model will be indicated by 0001B
in these bits) and EAX[11:8] contains the family (5 for the Pentium processor
family). EAX[31:12] are reserved, as well as EBX, and ECX. The Pentium processor
sets the feature register, EDX, to 1BFH indicating which features the Pentium
processor supports. A feature flag set to one indicates that the corresponding
feature is supported. The feature set register is defined as follows:
<PRE>EDX[0:0] FPU on chip
EDX[6:1] Refer to the Intel documentation
EDX[7:7] Machine Check Exception
EDX[8:8] CMPXCHG8B Instruction
EDX[31:9] Reserved
</PRE>

<P>
Software should determine the vendor identification in order to properly
interpret the feature register flag bits. For more information on the feature
set register, see the Intel documentation.
