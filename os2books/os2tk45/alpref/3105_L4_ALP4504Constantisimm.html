<H1>ALP4504:  [Constant] is immediate in MASM mode</H1><!-- entering slot 3120 -->
<P>
This message indicates that a single expression coded as a constant value
in square brackets [ ] is treated as though the brackets were not specified
(when the assembler is operating in MASM emulation mode, which is the default).
 This warning is issued because brackets are required for an indirect memory
expression when registers are involved, and the connotation is that the
presence of brackets is required to force a memory reference, when in fact
they are ignored.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Use a segment override (for example,<B> DS:[1234h]</B>)
when an indirect memory reference to an absolute address is desired.  As
explained above, the presence of brackets shown in the example is not required,
but they are preferred for readability.
<P>
Note:  A future release may provide an alternate mode of operation such
that bracketed constant values will be treated as memory references; this
warning message thus points out constructs that are incompatible with any
future releases operating in this mode.  Since the presence of brackets
are currently redundant in this context (and indicate a possible programming
error), it is recommended that they be removed.
