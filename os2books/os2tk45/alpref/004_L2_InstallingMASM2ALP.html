<H1>Installing MASM2ALP</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->The MASM2ALP utility consists of a single file:

<PRE>masm2alp.exe
</PRE>

<P>
To install MASM2ALP on OS/2:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy<B> masmalp.exe</B> into a directory of your
choice.  If the utility will be invoked from the command line (rather than
by absolute reference from a makefile or command file), then the selected
directory should be among those referenced by the <A HREF="036_L3_PATH.html">PATH
</A>environment variable.
<P>
It is recommended that both<B> masm2alp.exe</B> and<B> alp.exe</B> be installed
in the same directory, especially in build environments where reliance on
environment variables is discouraged.  If<B> masm2alp.exe</B> is invoked
by absolute path name (rather than via a <A HREF="036_L3_PATH.html">PATH
</A>search), it will use that same path when it first attempts to execute
<B>alp.exe</B>.  This technique allows execution of<B> alp.exe</B> without
requiring it to be referenced in the <A HREF="036_L3_PATH.html">PATH</A>.
 If the search fails, the path name prefix will be removed and MASM2ALP
will rely on the operating system to locate<B> alp.exe</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you also use the Microsoft Macro Assembler,
you must decide if MASM2ALP will replace MASM or co-exist with it.  This
usually means renaming the MASM executable (<B>masm.exe</B>) to something
else, then renaming<B> masm2alp.exe</B> to<B> masm.exe</B>.  Alternatively,
you may choose to leave the names unchanged, taking manual steps in your
makefiles or build scripts to insure that the correct executables are referenced
from your build environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Optionally, default values for command line options
may be established by defining the<B> MASM</B> environment variable.  MASM2ALP
interprets the contents of this environment variable before processing the
command line.  Any values set in this manner are translated and passed to
<B>alp.exe</B> via the command line.  The <A HREF="032_L3_BaseEXE_OPTIONS.html">&lt;BaseEXE&gt;_OPTIONS
</A>environment variable used by<B> alp.exe</B> is not queried or modified
by MASM2ALP.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If it becomes necessary to analyze a problem
with MASM2ALP (such as failure to invoke<B> alp.exe</B>, or other unexpected
behavior), defining the<B> ALP_ECHO</B> environment variable to any non-empty
value will cause MASM2ALP to echo the generated command line to the standard
output device.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
