<P>
When ALP is invoked, if the full path name of the ALP executable was provided
by the operating system, then the "path" portion is isolated and used to
construct the value of the<B> BasePATH</B> internal variable.  For instance,
if the user invoked ALP and the name of the executable was made available
as "C:\TOOLS\ALP.EXE", then the<B> BasePATH</B> internal variable would
contain the value "C:\TOOLS\". The value of<B> BasePATH</B> can be used
to locate ALP-specific components in the environment (such as the ALP messages
file) without the need to store this information in an alternate environment
variable such as DPATH.  Check your operating system documentation to see
if it feasible to use the<B> BasePATH</B> method of locating ALP components.

<P>
If the file name of the ALP executable is<B> not</B> available at run time,
then the value of<B> BasePATH</B> is NULL.
