This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix. In order to simplify interface
to the processor's bus, the destination operand receives a write cycle without
regard to the result of the comparison. DEST is written back if the comparison
fails, and SRC is written into the destination otherwise. (The processor
never produces a locked read without also producing a locked write.) This
instruction is not supported on Intel386 processors.
