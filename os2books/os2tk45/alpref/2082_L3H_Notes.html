<P>
FSAVE and FNSAVE do not store the FPU state until all FPU activity is complete.
Thus, the saved image reflects the state of the FPU after any previously
decoded instruction has been run.
<P>
If a program is to read from the memory image of the state following a save
instruction, it must issue an FWAIT instruction to ensure that the storage
is complete.
<P>
The save instructions are typically used when an operating system needs
to perform a context switch, or an exception handler needs to use the FPU,
or an application program wants to pass a "clean" FPU to a subroutine.
