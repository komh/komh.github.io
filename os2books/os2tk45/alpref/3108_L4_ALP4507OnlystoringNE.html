<H1>ALP4507:  Only storing NEAR portion of FAR pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 3123 -->
<P>
Within a data allocation directive, a variable was initialized to contain
the address of a FAR code label or variable defined in another segment.
However, the size of the variable being initialized is not large enough
to hold the fully qualified address (both segment and offset) of the item,
and only the offset portion was stored.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If the full address of the pointer is desired, then the
size of the data item being initialized must be increased.  Otherwise, the
OFFSET operator should be used in the address expression to truncate the
segment information and suppress this warning.
