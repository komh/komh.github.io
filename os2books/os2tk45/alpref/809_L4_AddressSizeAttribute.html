<H1>Address-Size Attribute for Stack</H1><!-- entering slot 819 -->
<P>
Instructions that use the stack implicitly (for example:  POP EAX) also
have a stack address-size attribute of either 16 or 32 bits. Instructions
with a stack address-size attribute of 16 use the 16-bit SP stack pointer
register; instructions with a stack address-size attribute of 32 bits use
the 32-bit ESP register to form the address of the top of the stack.
<P>
The stack address-size attribute is controlled by the B bit of the data-segment
descriptor in the SS register. A value of zero in the B bit selects a stack
address-size attribute of 16; a value of one selects a stack address-size
attribute of 32.
