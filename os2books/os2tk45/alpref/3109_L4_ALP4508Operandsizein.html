<H1>ALP4508:  Operand size inferred from immediate value</H1><!-- entering slot 3124 -->
<P>
When operating under MASM 5.10 emulation mode, the assembler allows an immediate
value to determine the size of the memory operand to which it is applied
if its magnitude exceeds that which will fit into a byte.  In this case,
it is assumed that the operation refers to a word-sized memory operand (2
bytes in USE16 segment, 4 bytes in a USE32 segment).  If the magnitude of
the immediate value is sufficiently small (less than 128), then the operation
is ambiguous, and an error is generated because the assembler does not know
whether to treat the memory operand as a byte or a word value.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> An explicit size should be given to the memory operand.
 Code relying on this behavior will not assemble correctly if the assembler
is not operating in MASM 5.10 emulation mode.
