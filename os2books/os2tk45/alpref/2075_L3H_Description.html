<P>
The save instructions write the current FPU state (environment and register
stack) to the specified destination, and then re-initialize the FPU. The
environment consists of the FPU control word, status word, tag word, and
error pointers (both data and instruction).
<P>
The state layout in memory depends on both operand size and the current
operating mode of the processor. The USE attribute of the current code segment
determines the operand size:  the 94-byte operand applies to USE16 segment,
and the 108-byte operand applies to a USE32 segment. Refer to the Intel
documentation for the environment layouts for both operand sizes in both
real mode and protected mode. (In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layout
is used.) The stack registers, beginning with ST and ending with ST(7),
are stored in the 80 bytes that immediately follow the environment image.
