<P>
The OUTS instruction transfers data from the memory byte, word, or doubleword
at the source-index register to the output port addressed by the DX register.
If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16-bits, the SI register
is used for the source-index register; otherwise, the address-size attribute
is 32-bits, and the ESI register is used for the source-index register.

<P>
The OUTS instruction does not allow specification of the port number as
an immediate value. The port must be addressed through the DX register value.
Load the correct value into the DX register before running the OUTS instruction.

<P>
The address of the source data is determined by the contents of source-index
register. Load the correct index value into the SI or ESI register before
running the OUTS instruction.
<P>
After the transfer, source-index register is advanced automatically. If
the DF flag is 0 (the CLD instruction was run), the source-index register
is incremented; if the DF flag is 1 (the STD instruction was run), it is
decremented. The amount of the increment or decrement is 1 if a byte is
output, 2 if a word is output, or 4 if a doubleword is output.
<P>
The OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD instructions are synonyms for the byte, word,
and doubleword OUTS instructions. The OUTS instruction can be preceded by
the REP prefix for block output of ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP
instruction for details on this operation.
