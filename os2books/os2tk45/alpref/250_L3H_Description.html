<P>
A<B><I> string literal</B></I> contains a sequence of zero or more characters
enclosed in quotation mark symbols.  Either a single (') or double (") quotation
mark symbol may be used as the<B><I> quote character</B></I> that opens
and closes the string literal.  If a single quotation mark symbol is used
as the quote character, then double quotation mark symbols may appear as
data characters within the string literal, and vice versa.  If the quote
character must also appear as a character within the string literal, use
two adjacent quote characters; this will allow a single occurrence of the
quote character to be inserted into the string literal.
<P>
A quote character must be used to terminate the string literal before the
end of the line is reached, otherwise an error message is issued and the
literal is terminated by the end of line character.  A string literal may
span multiple lines only if a backslash (\) appears as the last non-whitespace
character on the line, in which case the backslash, all surrounding whitespace
characters, and the end of line character are deleted and the literal is
continued with the first character on the next line.
