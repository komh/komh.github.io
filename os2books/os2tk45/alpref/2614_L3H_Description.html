The POPA instruction pops the eight 16-bit general registers. However, the
SP value is discarded instead of loaded into the SP register. The POPA instruction
reverses a previous PUSHA instruction, restoring the general registers to
their values before the PUSHA instruction was run. The first register popped
is the DI register.

The POPAD instruction pops the eight 32-bit general registers. The ESP value
is discarded instead of loaded into the ESP register. The POPAD instruction
reverses the previous PUSHAD instruction, restoring the general registers
to their values before the PUSHAD instruction was run. The first register
popped is the EDI register.
