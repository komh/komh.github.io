<H1>Operand-Size and Address-Size Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 816 -->
<P>
When executing an instruction, the processor can address memory using either
16 or 32-bit addresses. Consequently, each instruction that uses memory
addresses has associated with it an address-size attribute of either 16
or 32 bits. The use of 16-bit addresses implies both the use of 16-bit displacements
in instructions and the generation of 16-bit address offsets (segment relative
addresses) as the result of the effective address calculations. 32-bit addresses
imply the use of 32-bit displacements and the generation of 32-bit address
offsets. Similarly, an instruction that accesses words (16 bits) or doublewords
(32 bits) has an operand-size attribute of either 16 or 32 bits.
<P>
The attributes are determined by a combination of defaults, instruction
prefixes, and (for programs executing in protected mode) size-specification
bits in segment descriptors.
