<H1>ALP3517:  Selected processor does not support this operand</H1><!-- entering slot 3021 -->
<P>
An attempt was made to use an operand (such as a machine register) that
does not exist on the processor for which code is being generated.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Either use a processor selection directive to select the
correct target processor, or modify the referenced operand to one that is
supported on the target machine.
