<H1>ALP3741:  Alignment value not valid with current segment alignment</H1><!-- entering slot 3076 -->
<P>
The referenced alignment factor was less than the alignment factor specified
in the SEGMENT declaration containing the ALIGN or EVEN statement.  This
condition is illegal because the assembler cannot guarantee that the linker
will not invalidate the requested alignment when it exercises its right
to position the entire segment according to the alignment factor given in
the enclosing SEGMENT declaration.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> Respecify either the aligment factor or the SEGMENT delaration
so that the segment alignment is greater than or equal to any alignment
factor requested therein.
