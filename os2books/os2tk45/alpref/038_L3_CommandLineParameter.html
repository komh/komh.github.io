<H1>Command Line Parameter Types</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
Command line<B><I> parameters</B></I> are individual "words," or patterns
of characters separated by white space.  Each individual parameter is recognized
by the command line lexical analyzer as having a certain "pattern," and
is thus assigned a<B><I> parameter type</B></I>, as described in the following
sections.  Parameters should be separated by one or more blanks, tabs, or
(when reading from a response file) new line characters, and double quotation
marks may be used on the command line to remove the special meaning from
the operating system metacharacters.  Although the host operating system
may support the enclosing of command line parameters within double quotes
("") (known as "quoting"), the ALP command line parser also performs quote
interpretation.  This is necessary to properly interpret quoted parameters
within<B> @Filename</B> response files, for which there is no built-in support
provided by the default operating system command shell.
<P>
Parameter types are determined by looking at the first character of each
individual "word."  Options begin with a plus (+) or minus (-), and file
names begin with any other legal file name character (as dictated by the
operating system).  A special case is a word beginning with the<I> at sign
</I>(@) character, which signifies the beginning of the<B> @Filename</B> (read
from a response file) directive.
