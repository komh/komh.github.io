<P>
Run the AAA instruction only following an ADD instruction that leaves a
byte result in the AL register. The lower nibbles of the operands of the
ADD instruction should be in the range 0 through 9 (BCD digits). In this
case, the AAA instruction adjusts the AL register to contain the correct
decimal digit result. If the addition produced a decimal carry, the AH register
is incremented, and the CF and AF flags are set. If this same addition also
produced FH in the upper nibble of AL then AH is incremented again. If there
was no decimal carry, the CF and AF flags are cleared and the AH register
is unchanged. In either case, the AL register is left with its top nibble
set to 0. To convert the AL register to an ASCII result, follow the AAA
instruction with OR AL, 30H.
