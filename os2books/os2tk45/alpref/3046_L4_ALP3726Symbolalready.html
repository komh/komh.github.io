<P>
An identifier has been redeclared to have attributes that conflict with
a previous declaration or definition.
<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If this is an external declaration (using an EXTRN or
COMM directive) referencing a data variable, ensure that the type specifier
has been correctly respecified.  Verify that the variable has not already
been defined within this module.
<P>
External declarations for data labels or near code labels appearing within
segment boundaries must not reappear within the boundaries of a different
segment.  Labels appearing outside of segment boundaries inherit the default
address size (USE16 or USE32), and must not reappear within a segment having
a conflicting address size.
<P>
Far code labels may not be redeclared with conflicting address sizes.
