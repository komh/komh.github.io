<P>
The INT<I> n</I> instruction generates a call to an interrupt handler. The
immediate operand, from 0 to 255, gives the index number into the Interrupt
Descriptor Table (IDT) of the interrupt routine to be called. In protected
mode, the IDT consists of an array of eight-byte descriptors; the descriptor
for the interrupt invoked must indicate an interrupt, trap, or task gate.
In real-address mode, the IDT is an array of four byte-long pointers. In
protected and real-address modes, the base linear address of the IDT is
defined by the contents of the IDTR. The initial value of IDTR is zero upon
reset into real-address mode.
<P>
When the processor is running in virtual-8086 mode (VM=1), the IOPL determines
whether the INT<I> n</I> causes a general protection exception (IOPL&lt;3)
or runs a protected mode interrupt to privilege level 0. The interrupt gate's
DPL must be set to three and the target CPL of the interrupt service routine
must be zero to run the protected mode interrupt to privilege level 0.
<P>
The INTO conditional software instruction is identical to the INT<I> n</I> interrupt
instruction except that the interrupt number is implicitly 4, and the interrupt
is made only if the overflow flag is set.
<P>
The first 32 interrupts are reserved by Intel for system use. Some of these
interrupts are used for internally generated exceptions.
<P>
The INT<I> n</I> instruction generally behaves like a far call except that
the flags register is pushed onto the stack before the return address. Interrupt
procedures return via the IRET instruction, which pops the flags and return
address from the stack.
<P>
In Real Address Mode, the INT<I> n</I> instruction pushes the flags, the
CS register, and the return IP onto the stack, in that order, then jumps
to the long pointer indexed by the interrupt number.
