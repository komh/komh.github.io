<P>
The ARPL instruction has two operands. The first operand is a 16-bit memory
variable or word register that contains the value of a selector. The second
operand is a word register. If the RPL field ("requested privilege level"-bottom
two bits) of the first operand is less than the RPL field of the second
operand, the ZF flag is set and the RPL field of the first operand is increased
to match the second operand. Otherwise, the ZF flag is cleared and no change
is made to the first operand.
<P>
The ARPL instruction appears in operating system software, not in application
programs. It is used to guarantee that a selector parameter to a subroutine
does not request more privilege than the caller is allowed. The second operand
of the ARPL instruction is normally a register that contains the CS selector
value of the caller.
