<H1>ALP3225:  Register-indirect expression illegal in this context</H1><!-- entering slot 2997 -->
<P>
A constant or relocatable address expression was expected but the expression
also contained at least one machine register.  Such an address may be calculated
only at run time, and is illegal in this context.
