<H1>ALP4503:  Operand size does not match instruction</H1><!-- entering slot 3119 -->
<P>
This is a warning message that appears when an operand specifies a size
that differs from the operand size of the instruction.  In this case, the
operand size is implied by the instruction itself, and an explicit operand
size is not required.  However, if an operand size is supplied, it must
match the implied size or this warning will be issued.
