<P>
The STOS instruction transfers the contents of the AL, AX, or EAX register
to the memory byte or word given by the destination register relative to
the ES segment. The destination register is the DI register for an address-size
attribute of 16 bits or the EDI register for an address-size attribute of
32 bits.
<P>
The destination operand must be addressable from the ES register. A segment
override is not possible.
<P>
The address of the destination is determined by the contents of the destination
register, not by the explicit operand of the STOS instruction. This operand
is used only to validate ES segment addressability and to determine the
data type. Load the correct index value into the destination register before
running the STOS instruction.
<P>
After the transfer is made, the (E)DI register is automatically updated.
If the DF flag is 0 (the CLD instruction was run), the (E)DI register is
incremented; if the DF flag is 1 (the STD instruction was executed), the
(E)DI register is decremented. The (E)DI register is incremented or decremented
by 1 if a byte is stored, by 2 if a word is stored, or by 4 if a doubleword
is stored.
<P>
The STOSB, STOSW, and STOSD instructions are synonyms for the byte, word,
and doubleword STOS instructions, that do not require an operand. They are
simpler to use, but provide no type or segment checking.
<P>
The STOS instruction can be preceded by the REP prefix for a block fill
of CX or ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. Refer to the REP instruction
for further details.
