<P>
The SCAS instruction subtracts the memory byte or word at the destination
register from the AL, AX or EAX register. The result is discarded; only
the flags are set. The operand must be addressable from the ES segment;
no segment override is possible.
<P>
If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, the DI register
is used as the destination register, otherwise, the address-size attribute
is 32 bits and the EDI register is used.
<P>
The address of the memory data being compared is determined solely by the
contents of the destination register, not by the operand to the SCAS instruction.
The operand validates ES segment addressability and determines the data
type. Load the correct index value into the DI or EDI register before running
the SCAS instruction.
<P>
After the comparison is made, the destination register is automatically
updated. If the direction flag is 0 (the CLD instruction was run), the destination
register is incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (the STD instruction
was run), it is decremented. The increments or decrements are by 1 if bytes
are compared, by 2 if words are compared, or by 4 if doublewords are compared.

<P>
The SCASB, SCASW, and SCASD instructions are synonyms for the byre, word
and doubleword SCAS instructions that don't require operands. They are simpler
to code, but provide no type or segment checking.
<P>
The SCAS instruction can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for a block
search of CX or ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for further
details.
