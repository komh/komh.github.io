<P>
Run the AAM instruction only after running a MUL instruction between two
unpacked BCD digits that leaves the result in the AX register. Because the
result is less than 100, it is contained entirely in the AL register. The
AAM instruction unpacks the AL result by dividing AL by the second byte
of the opcode, leaving the quotient (most-significant digit) in the AH register
and the remainder (least-significant digit) in the AL register.
