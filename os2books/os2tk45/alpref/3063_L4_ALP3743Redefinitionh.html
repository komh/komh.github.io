<H1>ALP3743:  Redefinition has different value</H1><!-- entering slot 3078 -->
<P>
A redefinition construct was encountered (such as a type definition directive)
where the redefined value did not match that of a previous definition.  Redefinitions
are allowed for this particular construct, but they must restate the same
value given in the original definition.
