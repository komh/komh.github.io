<H1>ALP5503:  Instruction padded with NOP(s)</H1><!-- entering slot 3163 -->
<P>
This message indicates that the assembler generated one or more NOP instructions
to follow the object code generated for the referenced instruction.  The
instruction operand list contains a forward-referenced expression which
forced the assembler to allow space for the longest possible instruction
encoding on the first pass.  The generation of NOP instructions may be avoided
by qualifying the forward reference with a &lt;type&gt; PTR override.
