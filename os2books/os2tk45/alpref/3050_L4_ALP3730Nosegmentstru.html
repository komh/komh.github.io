<H1>ALP3730:  No segment, structure, or union opened as "<identifier>"</H1><!-- entering slot 3065 -->
<P>
The ENDS directive was used, but no segment, structure, or union was open
(or did not match the referenced name) and thus could not be terminated.

<P>
<B>Recovery: </B> If a name was given in the message, verify that it matches
the name used in the associated SEGMENT, STRUC, or UNION directive.  Verify
that nested occurrences of SEGMENT, STRUC, or UNION are paired with a matching
ENDS directive.
