<P>
The MOV instruction copies the second operand to the first operand.
<P>
If the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, SS, etc.), then
data from a descriptor is also loaded into the shadow portion of the register.
The data for the register is obtained from the descriptor table entry for
the selector given. A null selector (values 0000-0003) can be loaded into
the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing an exception; however,
use of these registers causes a #GP(0) exception, and no memory reference
occurs.
<P>
A MOV into SS instruction inhibits all interrupts until after the processing
of the next instruction (which should be a MOV into ESP instruction).
<P>
Loading a segment register under Protected Mode results in special checks
and actions, as described in the following listing: IF SS is loaded;
<BR>
THEN
<BR>
  IF selector is null THEN #GP(0);
<BR>
  Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  Selector's RPL must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  AR byte must indicate a writable data segment else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  DPL in the AR byte must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  Segment must be marked present else #SS(selector);
<BR>
  Load SS with selector;
<BR>
  Load SS with descriptor.
<BR>
FI;
<BR>
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with non-null selector;
<BR>
THEN
<BR>
  Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits
<BR>
   else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  AR byte must indicate data or readable code segment else #GP(selector);
<BR>
  IF data or nonconforming code segment
<BR>
  THEN both the RPL and the CPL must be less than or equal to DPL in AR
byte;
<BR>
  ELSE #GP(selector);
<BR>
  FI;
<BR>
  Segment must be marked present else #NP(selector);
<BR>
  Load segment register with selector;
<BR>
  Load segment register with descriptor;
<BR>
FI;
<BR>
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with a null selector;
<BR>
THEN
<BR>
  Load segment register with selector;
<BR>
  Clear descriptor valid bit;
<BR>
FI;
<BR>
