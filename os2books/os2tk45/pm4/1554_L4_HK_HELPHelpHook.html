<H1>HK_HELP - Help Hook</H1><!-- entering slot 1588 -->
<P>
The<I> help hook</I> allows an application to include online help. The system
calls a help hook function during the default processing of the WM_HELP
message. Help processing is done in two stages: creating the WM_HELP message
and calling the help hook. The WM_HELP message can come from the following
sources:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WM_CHAR message, after translation by an ACCEL data
structure with the AF_HELP style. The default system accelerator table translates
the F1 key into a help message. The WM_HELP message is posted to the current
focus window, which can be a menu, a button, a frame, or your client window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Menu-bar selection, when the MIS_HELP style is specified
for the menu-bar item. The WM_HELP message is posted to the current focus
window.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Dialog-window push button, when the BS_HELP style
is specified for the push button. The WM_HELP message is posted to the owner
window of the button, which normally is the dialog window.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Message box, when the MB_HELP style is specified for
the message box. The WM_HELP message is posted to the message box.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The WM_HELP message is posted to the current focus window. The default processing
in WinDefWindowProc is to pass the message up to the parent window. If the
message reaches the client window, it can be processed there. If the message
reaches a frame window, the default frame-window procedure calls the help
hook. The help hook is also called if a WM_HELP message is generated while
the application is in menu mode, that is, while a selection is being made
from a menu. The following code shows the syntax for a help hook function:

<PRE>BOOL EXPENTRY HelpHook(HAB hab, ULONG usMode, ULONG idTopic,                       ULONG idSubTopic, PRECTL prcPosition)

</PRE>

<P>
If a help hook function returns TRUE, the system does not call the next
help hook function in the chain. If the function returns FALSE, the system
calls the next help hook function in the chain. The arguments passed to
the function provide contextual information, such as the screen coordinates
of the focus window and whether the message originated in a message box
or a menu.
<P>
The WM_HELP message often goes to a frame window instead of to the client
window. The frame window processes a WM_HELP message as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the window with the focus is the FID_CLIENT window,
the frame window passes the WM_HELP message to the FID_CLIENT window.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the parent of the window with the focus is the
FID_CLIENT frame-control window, the frame window calls the help hook, specifying
the following:
<PRE>Mode     = HLPM_FRAME
Topic    = frame-window identifier
Subtopic = focus-window identifier
Position = screen coordinates of focus window

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the parent of the focus window is not an FID_CLIENT
window (it could be the frame window or a second-level dialog window), the
frame window calls the help hook, specifying the following:
<PRE>Mode     = HLPM_WINDOW
Topic    = identifier of parent of focus window
Subtopic = focus-window identifier
Position = screen coordinates of focus window

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application receives the WM_HELP message in its dialog-window procedure.
The application can ignore the message, in which case the frame-window action
occurs as described, or the application can handle the WM_HELP message directly.

<P>
Menu windows receive a WM_HELP message when the user presses the Help accelerator
key (F1 by default) while a menu is displayed. Menu windows process WM_HELP
messages by calling the help hook, specifying the following:
<PRE>Mode     = HLPM_MENUTopic    = identifier of pull-down menu
Subtopic = identifier of selected item in pull-down menu
Position = screen coordinates of selected item

</PRE>

<P>
A help hook function should respond by displaying information about the
selected menu item.
<P>
WinDefWindowProc processes WM_HELP messages by passing the message to the
parent window. Typically, the message moves up the parent chain until it
arrives at a frame window.
