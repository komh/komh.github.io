<H1>Providing Emphasis</H1><!-- entering slot 1334 -->
<P>
The container control supports various types of emphasis. The following
list describes forms of emphasis that have a distinct visible representation
in the container control:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Selected-state and unavailable-state emphasis
<P>
When a container item is selected, the container item receives<I> selected-state
emphasis</I>, which means that the emphasis is applied to icon/text or bit-map/text
pairs in the Icon, Name, Tree icon, and Tree name views; text strings in
the Text and Tree text views; and an entire row that represents a container
item in the Details view.
<P>
The color for selected-state emphasis can be changed by using the control
panel or WinSetPresParam, which results in a WM_PRESPARAMCHANGED message
being sent to the container.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In-use emphasis
<P>
Cross-hatching behind an icon or bit map indicates<I> in-use emphasis</I>.
In-use emphasis is not applied to container items in the Text view, Tree
text view, or Details view when it contains text only. However, the Details
view often includes icons or bit maps in one column of each record, usually
the leftmost column. In this situation, specify the column that contains
the icons or bit maps so that in-use emphasis can be applied to them. This
column can be set by using the<I> pFieldInfoObject</I> field of the CNRINFO
data structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Target emphasis
<P>
Target emphasis is used during direct manipulation. When a user drags one
container item over another, the item beneath the dragged item displays
<I>target emphasis</I>. Two forms of target emphasis (visible feedback)
are available: a black line and a black border. These forms of emphasis
indicate the<I> target</I>, where the container item is dropped if the user
releases the drag button.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
