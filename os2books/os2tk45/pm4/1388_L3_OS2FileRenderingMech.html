<H1>OS/2 File Rendering Mechanism</H1><!-- entering slot 1414 -->
<P>
This rendering mechanism can be used by various containers, including file
folders and trash cans. These containers allow objects to be dragged and
dropped on white space in the container to accomplish a Move or Copy operation.
They also can allow objects in the same or another container to be dragged
and dropped on objects within the container to accomplish an operation.
