<P>
An application can check the key-repeat count of a WM_CHAR message to determine
whether the message represents more than 1 keystroke.  The count is greater
than 1 if the keyboard is sending characters to the system queue faster
than the application can retrieve them.  If the system queue fills up, the
system combines consecutive keyboard input events for each key into a single
WM_CHAR message, with the key-repeat count set to the number of combined
events.
