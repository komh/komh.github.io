<H1>Application-Defined Rendering Mechanisms</H1><!-- entering slot 1438 -->
<P>
An application can choose to define a new rendering mechanism. However,
if an application intends to provide renderings from this extended rendering
mechanism to existing rendering mechanisms, it should publish enough information
so that other application developers can use the new mechanism. An application
must address several distinct areas of definition. These areas are described
below, in general, and also are addressed under the definition for the system
mechanisms.
