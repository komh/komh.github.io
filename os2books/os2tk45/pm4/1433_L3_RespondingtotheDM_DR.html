<H1>Responding to the DM_DRAGLEAVE Message</H1><!-- entering slot 1459 -->
<P>
DM_DRAGLEAVE is sent whenever the DM_DRAGOVER message is sent to a window,
and the pointer is moved outside the bounds of that window. If the target
or an object in the window had been emphasized as a target, it should be
de-emphasized.
<P>
Container windows monitor the position of the pointer on DM_DRAGOVER messages
and simulate the DM_DRAGLEAVE message when the pointer moves on or off a
contained object.
<P>
A DM_DRAGLEAVE message is not sent if the user drops the objects being dragged
within the window. Therefore, when DM_DROP is received, the application
de-emphasizes any target that was emphasized as a valid target.
<P>
If the user drags the pointer outside the target window, resulting in a
new target, a DM_DRAGLEAVE message is sent to the former target. The receiver
of a DM_DRAGLEAVE message should use it to de-emphasize the target, thus
providing the user with visible feedback that this is no longer the target.
