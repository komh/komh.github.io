<H1>Window Activation</H1><!-- entering slot 1702 -->
<P>
Although the operating system can display windows from many different applications
simultaneously during a PM session, the user can interact with only one
application at a time-the<I> active</I> application.  The other applications
continue to run, but they cannot receive user input until they become active.

<P>
To enable the user to easily identify the active application, the system
activates all frames in the tree between HWND_DESKTOP and the window with
input focus.  That is, the system positions the active frame window above
all other top-level windows on the screen.  If the active window is a standard
frame window, the window's title bar and sizing border are highlighted.

<P>
The user can control which application is active by clicking on a window
or by pressing the Alt+Tab or Alt+Esc key combinations.  An application
can set the active frame window by calling WinSetActiveWindow; it also can
obtain the handle of the active frame window by using WinQueryActiveWindow.

<P>
When one window is deactivated and another activated, the system sends a
WM_ACTIVATE message, first to the window being deactivated, then to the
window being activated.  The<I> fActive</I> parameter of the WM_ACTIVATE
message is set to FALSE for the window being deactivated and set to TRUE
for the window being activated.  An application can use this message to
track the activation state of a client window.
