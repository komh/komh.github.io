<H1>Frame-Window Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 1566 -->
<P>
An application typically creates a frame window by using WinCreateStdWindow,
which creates a frame window, a client window, and the specified frame controls.
 The application also can call WinCreateWindow with the WC_FRAME window
class, which creates the frame window and controls but not the client window.
 To create the client, the application can call WinCreateWindow, specifying
the original frame window as the parent and owner.
<P>
An application also can use a frame window to create a dialog window.  For
a dialog window, the frame window contains control windows but no client
window.  The application creates the dialog window by using WinLoadDlg or
WinCreateDlg. These functions require an appropriate dialog template from
the application's resource-definition file.  The dialog template specifies
the styles and dimensions for the frame window and for the control windows
that compose the dialog window.
