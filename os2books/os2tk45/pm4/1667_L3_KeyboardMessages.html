<H1>Keyboard Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 1704 -->
<P>
The system sends keyboard input events as WM_CHAR messages to the message
queue of the keyboard-focus window.  If no window has the keyboard focus,
the system posts WM_CHAR messages to the message queue of the active frame
window.  Following are two typical situations in which an application receives
WM_CHAR messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
An application has a client window or custom control window, either of which
can have the keyboard focus.  If the window procedure for the client or
control window does not process WM_CHAR messages, it should pass them to
WinDefWindowProc, which will pass them to the owner.  Dialog control windows,
in particular, should pass unprocessed WM_CHAR messages to the WinDefDlgProc
function, because this is how the user interface implements control processing
for the Tab and Arrow keys.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
An application window owns a control window whose window procedure can handle
some, but not all, WM_CHAR messages.  This is common in dialog windows.
 If the window procedure of a control in a dialog window cannot process
a WM_CHAR message, the procedure can pass the message to the WinDefDlgProc
function.  This function sends the message to the control window's owner,
which usually is a dialog frame window.  The application's dialog procedure
then receives the WM_CHAR message.  This also is the case when an application
client window owns a control window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A WM_CHAR message can represent a key-down or key-up transition.  It might
contain a character code, virtual-key code, or scan code.  This message
also contains information about the state of the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys.

<P>
Each time a user presses a key, at least two WM_CHAR messages are generated:
one when the key is pressed, and one when the key is released.  If the user
holds down the key long enough to trigger the keyboard repeat, multiple
WM_CHAR key-down messages are generated.  If the keyboard repeats faster
than the application can retrieve the input events from its message queue,
the system combines repeating character events into one WM_CHAR message
and increments a count byte that indicates the number of keystrokes represented
by the message.  Generally, this byte is set to 1, but an application should
check each WM_CHAR message to avoid missing any keystrokes.
<P>
An application can ignore the repeat count.  For example, an application
might ignore the repeat count on Arrow keys to prevent the cursor from skipping
characters when the system is slow.
