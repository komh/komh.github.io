<H1>Tree Icon View and Tree Text View</H1><!-- entering slot 1311 -->
<BR>
The Tree icon and Tree text views are identical in every aspect except their
appearance on the screen. Container items in the Tree icon view (CV_TREE | CV_ICON)
are displayed as either icon/text pairs or bit-map/text pairs. The items
are drawn as icons or bit maps with one or more lines of text displayed
to the right of each icon or bit map.
<P>
Container items in the Tree text view (CV_TREE | CV_TEXT) are displayed
as text strings. In both views, the container control does not limit the
number of lines of text or the number of characters in each line.
<P>
In the Tree icon and Tree text views, a parent item is expanded by selecting
the Collapsed icon/bit map, which is displayed to the left of the parent
item.
<P>
The Collapsed icon/bit map should contain some visible indication that the
item can be expanded. The default Collapsed bit map that is provided by
the container control uses a plus sign (+) to indicate that more items,
the children of this parent, can be added to the view.
<P>
When the child items of a parent item are displayed, the Collapsed icon/bit
map to the left of that parent item changes to an Expanded icon/bit map.
Just as the Collapsed icon/bit map provides a visible indication that an
item can be expanded, so should the Expanded icon/bit map indicate that
an item can be collapsed. The default Expanded bit map provided by the container
control uses a minus sign (-) to indicate that the child items of this parent
can be subtracted from the view. If any of the child items have children
of their own, a Collapsed or Expanded icon/bit map is displayed to their
immediate left as well.
<P>
To display your own Collapsed and Expanded icons or bit maps, specify their
handles by using the<I> hptrCollapsed</I> and<I> hptrExpanded</I> fields
of the CNRINFO data structure for icons, and the<I> hbmCollapsed</I> and
<I>hbmExpanded</I> fields for bit maps. Also, you can use the<I> slTreeBitmapOrIcon
</I>field to specify the size, in pels, of these Collapsed and Expanded
icons and bit maps.
