<H1>Split Bar Support for the Details View</H1><!-- entering slot 1315 -->
<BR>
A split bar enables the application to split the container window vertically
between two column boundaries. This function is available only in the Details
view.
<BR>

<P>
The two portions of the work area on either side of the split bar appear
side-by-side. They scroll in unison vertically, but they scroll independently
horizontally.
<P>
The application is responsible for specifying the position of the split
bar, which is defined with the<I> xVertSplitbar</I> field. Also, the rightmost
column of the left split window is specified with the<I> pFieldInfoLast
</I>field.<I> xVertSplitbar</I> and<I> pFieldInfoLast</I> are fields of
the CNRINFO data structure.
<P>
The left split window cannot be empty if there is data in the right window.
The right split window is not required to have data. However, because data
cannot be scrolled from the right split window into the left split window,
or from left to right, the split bar loses much of its usefulness if the
right split window is empty.
<P>
The user can drag the vertical split bar within the limits of the window.
As the user drags the split bar to the left, the right split window becomes
wider; as the user drags the split bar to the right, the left split window
becomes wider.
<P>
Each container control can have one vertical split bar. Horizontal split
bars are not supported.
<P>
