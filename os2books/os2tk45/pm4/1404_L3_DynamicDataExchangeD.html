<H1>Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Rendering Mechanism</H1><!-- entering slot 1430 -->
<P>
This rendering mechanism can be used by various containers and applications.
The containers allow objects to be dragged and dropped on white space in
the container to accomplish a Move or Copy operation. They can also allow
objects in the same or another container to be dragged and dropped on objects
within the container to accomplish some operation.
