<P>
Mouse button 1 (the select button) is used for selecting container items,
and mouse button 2 (the drag button) is used for dragging and dropping container
items during direct manipulation. These definitions also apply to the same
buttons on any other pointing device.
<P>
In addition, a user can press a keyboard key while pressing a mouse button;
this is called<I> keyboard augmentation</I>. The only instance of keyboard
augmentation defined specifically for the container control is pressing
the Alt key with the select button, which starts direct editing of text
in a container.
<P>
In addition, the container control supports two keyboard cursors that can
be moved by using keyboard navigation keys:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> selection cursor</I>, a dotted black box drawn
around a container item, which represents the current position for the purpose
of keyboard navigation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> text cursor</I>, a vertical line that shows
the user where text can be inserted or deleted when container text is being
edited directly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Keyboard navigation consists of the use of the Up and Down Arrow, Left and
Right Arrow, Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys. If container items are not
visible within the work area, navigation with these keys causes the items
to scroll into view if the user is not editing container text directly.
