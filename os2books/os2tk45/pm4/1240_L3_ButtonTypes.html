<H1>Button Types</H1><!-- entering slot 1260 -->
<P>
There are four main<I> types</I> of buttons: push buttons, radio buttons,
check boxes, and three-state check boxes.  A button's type determines how
the button looks and behaves.
<P>
A radio button, check box, or three-state check box<I> controls</I> an operation;
a push button<I> initiates</I> an operation.  For example, a user might
set printing options (such as paper size, print quality, and printer type)
in a print-command dialog window containing an array of radio buttons and
check boxes.  After setting the options, the user would select a push button
to tell an application that printing should begin (or be canceled).  Then,
the application would query the state of each check box and radio button
to determine the printing parameters.
