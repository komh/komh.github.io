<H1>Size Field</H1><!-- entering slot 1553 -->
<P>
The<I> Size</I> field is a drop-down combination box that displays available
font sizes. Users can display and select from a list of available sizes
for a font, or they can type a font size directly into the entry field.

<P>
When users select a font size from the drop-down list, the<I> Size</I> field
display is refreshed with the selected size. The preview area is updated
to show the character string in the selected font size, using the family
name, font style, and emphasis currently in effect.
<P>
The font sizes included in the drop-down list are dependent on the character
definition of the font. For image or raster fonts, all available sizes are
listed.  For outline fonts, the default sizes are 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and
24 points. If required, the application can specify the available sizes
for outline fonts.
<P>
When users type a font size in the entry field, the preview area is updated
immediately. The<I> Size</I> field will accept a fixed point number, such
as 24.25, with up to four places saved after the decimal.
