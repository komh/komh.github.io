<P>
An application window's response to a mouse click depends on whether the
window is active.  The first click in an inactive window should activate
the window.  Subsequent clicks in the active window produce an application-specific
action.
<P>
A common problem for an application that processes WM_BUTTON1DOWN or similar
messages is failing to activate the window or set the keyboard focus.  If
the window processes WM_CHAR messages, the window procedure should call
WinSetFocus to make sure the window receives the keyboard focus and is activated.
 If the window does not process WM_CHAR messages, the application should
call WinSetActiveWindow to activate the window.
