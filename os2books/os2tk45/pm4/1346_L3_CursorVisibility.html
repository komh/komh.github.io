<H1>Cursor Visibility</H1><!-- entering slot 1371 -->
<P>
An application can use the WinShowCursor function to show or hide a cursor.
 The operating system maintains a<I> show level</I> for the cursor:  when
the cursor is visible, the its show level is zero; each time the cursor
is hidden, its show level is incremented; each time the cursor is shown,
its show level is decremented.  The show:hide relationship is 1:1, so the
show level cannot drop below zero.  When first creating a cursor, an application
should show the cursor because the application creates the cursor with a
show level of 1.
<P>
The operating system automatically hides the cursor when the application
calls WinBeginPaint; it shows the cursor when the application calls WinEndPaint.
 Therefore, there is no conflict with the cursor during WM_PAINT processing.
