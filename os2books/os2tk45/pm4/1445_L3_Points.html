<P>
All drawing in a window takes place in the context of the window's coordinate
system.  Locations of points in the window are described by POINTL structures,
which contain an x and a y coordinate for the point.  The lower-left corner
of a window always has the coordinates (0,0).
<P>
The WinMapWindowPoints function converts the coordinates of points from
one window-coordinate space to those of another window-coordinate space.
 If one of the specified windows is HWND_DESKTOP, the function uses screen
coordinates.  This function is useful for converting window coordinates
to screen coordinates or the other way around.
