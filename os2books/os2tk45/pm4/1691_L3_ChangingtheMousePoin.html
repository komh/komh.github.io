<H1>Changing the Mouse Pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 1729 -->
<P>
Once you create or load a mouse pointer, you can change its shape by calling
WinSetPointer.  Following are three typical situations in which an application
changes the shape of the mouse pointer:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When an application receives a WM_MOUSEMOVE message,
there is an opportunity to change the mouse pointer based on its location
in the window.  If you want the standard arrow pointer, pass this message
on to WinDefWindowProc. If you want to change the mouse pointer on a standard
dialog window, you need to capture the WM_CONTROLPOINTER message and return
a pointing-device pointer handle.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When an application is about to start a time-consuming
process during which it will not accept user input, the application displays
the<I> system-wait</I> mouse pointer (SPTR_WAIT).  Upon finishing the process,
the application resets the mouse pointer to its former shape.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to save the current mouse pointer,
set the hourglass pointer, and restore the original mouse pointer.  Notice
that the hourglass pointer also is saved in a global variable so that the
application can return it when responding to a WM_MOUSEMOVE message during
a time-consuming process.
<PRE>        HPOINTER hptrOld, hptrWait, hptrCurrent;

        /* Get the current pointer.                   */
        hptrOld = WinQueryPointer(HWND_DESKTOP);

        /* Get the wait mouse pointer.                */
        hptrWait = WinQuerySysPointer(HWND_DESKTOP,
            SPTR_WAIT, FALSE);

        /* Save the wait pointer to use in WM_MOUSEMOVE processing.*/
        hptrCurrent = hptrWait;

        /* Set the mouse pointer to the wait pointer. */
        WinSetPointer(HWND_DESKTOP, hptrWait);

        /*
         * Do a time-consuming operation, then restore the
         * original mouse pointer.
         */
        WinSetPointer(HWND_DESKTOP, hptrOld);

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When an application needs to indicate its current
operational mode, it changes the pointer shape.  For example, a paint program
with a palette of drawing tools should change the pointer shape to indicate
which drawing tool is in use currently.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
