<H1>Allocating and Freeing a DRAGTRANSFER Data Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 1420 -->
<P>
The data in a drag transfer message is carried in a DRAGTRANSFER data structure.
DRAGTRANSFER data structures are allocated when the target calls DrgAllocDragtransfer.

<P>
When the conversation is completed, both the source and the target must
call DrgFreeDragtransfer to free the shared memory. The target should do
it immediately after sending a DM_ENDCONVERSATION message. The source should
do it immediately after sending a DM_RENDERCOMPLETE message.
