<P>
The container control can have a non-scrollable title that consists of one
or more lines of text. The container control does not limit the number of
lines or the number of characters in each line. If specified, this title
is the first line or lines of the container control. The text of the title
is determined by the application and can be used to identify the container
or to contain status information.
<P>
The CA_CONTAINERTITLE attribute must be set to include a title in a container
window. The default is no container title.
<P>
If you do not want the user to be able to edit the container title directly,
you can set the CA_TITLEREADONLY attribute. The default is that the container
title can be edited.
<P>
Below the title a horizontal line separates the container title from the
container items. The CA_TITLESEPARATOR attribute must be set in order to
include a separator line in a container window. The default is no separator
line.
<P>
The container titles in both figures are centered. This is the default.
However, the CA_TITLECENTER, CA_TITLELEFT, or CA_TITLERIGHT attribute can
be used to specify whether a container title is to be centered, left-justified,
or right-justified.
<P>
All the container attributes described here are attributes of the CNRINFO
data structure's<I> flWindowAttr</I> field.
