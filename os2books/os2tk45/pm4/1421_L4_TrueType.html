<H1>True Type</H1><!-- entering slot 1447 -->
<P>
The<I> true type</I> of an object is the type that most accurately describes
the object. For example, the input to a C compiler could have the type<I> Plain
Text</I> (DRT_TEXT), but would be more accurately described as<I> C Code
</I>(DRT_C).<I> C Code</I> would be the true type of this object. Multiple
types can be conveyed by using a comma to separate strings. The following
figure shows the format to use to convey multiple types:
<PRE>"type,type..."

</PRE>

<P>
The true type should appear first in the list of types, so the type string
for the example object would be "C Code, Plain Text".
