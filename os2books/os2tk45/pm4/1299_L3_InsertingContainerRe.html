<H1>Inserting Container Records</H1><!-- entering slot 1320 -->
<P>
After the memory is allocated, you can insert one or more container records
by using the CM_INSERTRECORD message.
<P>
The following sample code inserts records into a container for which memory
was allocated in the previous code fragment:
<PRE>/**********************************************************************/
/*  We will need the first record's address to                        */
/*  insert them into the container.                                   */
/**********************************************************************/
    FirstRec = Address;

/**********************************************************************/
/*  Loop through the address book, loading as we go.                  */
/*  Because the CM_ALLOCRECORD returns a linked                       */
/*  list, the address of the next record is retrieved                 */
/*  from each record as we go (preccNextRecord).                      */
/**********************************************************************/
    for (x = 0; x &lt; MAXFRIENDS; x++)
    {
       Address-&gt;cb = sizeof(RECORDCORE);    /* Standard records       */
       Address-&gt;hptrIcon = hIcon;           /* File icon              */
       Address-&gt;pszIcon = Friends[x].NickName;
       Address-&gt;pszName = Friends[x].FullName;
       Address-&gt;pszText = Friends[x].FullName;
       Address = Address-&gt;preccNextRecord;  /* Next record in list    */
    }

/**********************************************************************/
/*  Set up the insert record structure to place the                   */
/*  records in the container.                                         */
/**********************************************************************/
    recsIn.cb = sizeof(RECORDINSERT);

    /* Put the records in after any others */
    recsIn.pRecordOrder = (PRECORDCORE)CMA_END;

    /* All the records are top level (not children of other records) */
    recsIn.pRecordParent = NULL;

    /* The icons are top level */
    recsIn.zOrder = (USHORT)CMA_TOP;

    /* Redraw the container */
    recsIn.fInvalidateRecord = TRUE;

    /* Set the number of records to insert */
    recsIn.cRecordsInsert = MAXFRIENDS;

/**********************************************************************/
/*  Insert the records into the container.                            */
/**********************************************************************/
    WinSendMsg(hWnd,
               CM_INSERTRECORD,
               (PRECORDCORE)FirstRec,
               &amp;recsIn);
}

</PRE>

<P>
The CM_INSERTRECORD message requires you to provide two pointers. The first
pointer points to the record that is to be inserted, which is specified
in the<I> FirstRec</I> parameter. When you are inserting multiple records,
use this parameter to specify a pointer to a linked list of records.
<P>
The second pointer points to a RECORDINSERT data structure (<I>&amp;recsIn</I>),
which specifies information the container needs for inserting records.
<P>
One of the elements of information that this data structure contains is
the order in which the records are to be inserted, which is specified in
the<I> pRecordOrder</I> field. In this field you have two options. The first
option is to specify a pointer to a container record. The records being
inserted are placed immediately after that record. In this case, the<I> pRecordParent
</I>field is ignored.
<P>
The second option is to specify whether the records being inserted are to
be placed at the beginning or end of a list of records. This is done by
specifying either the CMA_FIRST or CMA_END attributes. If you choose this
option, the list of records used depends on the value of the<I> pRecordParent
</I>field.
<P>
If CMA_FIRST or CMA_END is specified and the value of the<I> pRecordParent
</I>field is NULL, the inserted records are placed at the beginning or end
of the root-level records. However, if CMA_FIRST or CMA_END is specified
and<I> pRecordParent</I> contains a pointer to a parent item record, the
records are inserted at the beginning or end of the list of child item records
that this parent record contains.
<P>
The RECORDINSERT data structure also lets you specify the z-order position
of the records being inserted. The CMA_TOP and CMA_BOTTOM attributes of
the<I> zOrder</I> field place the record at the top or bottom, relative
to the other records in the z-order list. This field applies to the Icon
view only.
<P>
To specify the number of records that are being inserted, use the<I> cRecordsInsert
</I>field. The value of this field must be greater than 0.
<P>
The last field in the RECORDINSERT data structure is<I> flInvalidateRecord</I>,
which enables you to control whether the records are displayed automatically
when they are inserted. If you specify TRUE in this field, the display is
updated automatically.  However, if you specify FALSE, the application must
send the CM_INVALIDATERECORD message after the records are inserted to update
the display.
<P>
Where items are positioned in a container depends on the view the user has
specified. If the Icon view is specified and the CCS_AUTOPOSITION style
bit is not set, the<I> x-</I> and<I> y-</I>coordinates for each record,
which are stored in the<I> ptlIcon</I> field of the RECORDCORE and<!-- entering slot 1321 --> MINIRECORDCORE
data structures, determine its position. Records displayed in the Name view,
Text view, Tree view, and Details view are positioned as previously described
in this section.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Records inserted into a list of child record items can be
displayed in the Tree view only. These records are visible only if the parent
record item to which these child record items belong is expanded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
