<H1>Using Control Windows in a Non-Dialog Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1364 -->
<P>
To use a control window in a non-dialog window, an application must call
the WinCreateWindow function, using the appropriate window class name.  An
application usually specifies one of its client windows as the owner of
the control window.  Therefore, the client-window procedure receives notification
messages from the control window.  In cases where a control is owned by
the frame window (such as a menu control), the notification messages to
the frame window are passed to the client window.
