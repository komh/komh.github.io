<H1>About Direct Manipulation</H1><!-- entering slot 1399 -->
<P>
The direct manipulation protocol enables the user to select an object in
a window, drag it to another location, and drop it on another object or
in another window.<I> Dragging</I> is the act of moving an object as though
it were attached to the pointer; it is performed by pressing and holding
the drag button and moving the pointer.<I> Dropping</I> is the act of fixing
the position of the dragged object by releasing the drag button on the pointer.
This causes interaction (data exchange) between the window from which the
selected object is dragged and the window containing the object on which
the selected object is dropped.
<P>
The window containing the dragged object is the<I> source</I>. The window
containing the object that was dropped on is the<I> target</I>. The source
and target can be the same window, different windows within the same application,
or windows belonging to different applications. The dragged object can be
either the only visible object in the source window or one of many objects.
The target object can be either the only visible object in the target window
or one of many objects. A source or target window that contains multiple
objects is a<I> container window</I>.
<P>
The data exchange that occurs between the source and target after a direct
manipulation operation enables applications that support the protocol to
integrate easily, while providing a simple user interface.
