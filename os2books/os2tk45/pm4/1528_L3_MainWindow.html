<H1>Main Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1561 -->
<P>
The<I> main window</I> of an application, typically, is composed of a frame
window and a client window.  The frame window usually includes control windows
such as a title bar, system menu, menu bar (<I>action bar</I> or<I> menu
</I>in user terminology), and scroll bars.
<P>
A frame window provides the standard services the user expects from a window-for
example, moving, sizing, minimizing, and maximizing.  The frame window receives
input from the control windows (called<I> frame controls</I>) and sends
messages to both the frame controls and the client window.
