<H1>Selecting Container Items</H1><!-- entering slot 1330 -->
<P>
Except during direct manipulation and direct editing of text in a container,
a user must select a container item before performing an action on it. The
container control provides several selection types, along with selection
techniques to implement those types. The container control also supports
two selection mechanisms: pointing device, such as a mouse, and the keyboard.
