<P>
The container control automatically provides horizontal or vertical scroll
bars, or both, whenever the container window's work area is not large enough
to display all of the container items.
<P>
If all container items are visible in the work area, the scroll bars are
either removed or disabled, depending on the view and how the items are
positioned, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If container items are displayed in the icon or tree
view, and one or more items are not visible in the work area, a horizontal
scroll bar, vertical scroll bar, or both, are provided, depending on the
position of the items outside of the work area. If container items are positioned
to the right or left of the work area, a horizontal scroll bar is provided;
if container items are positioned below or above the work area, a vertical
scroll bar is provided.
<P>
Scroll bars are not provided if all the container items are visible in the
work area. Scroll bars are removed from the container window if either of
the following occurs:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Container items positioned outside the work area
are moved into the work area.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The size of the container window is increased so
that container items formerly not visible become visible.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
container items are displayed in non-flowed text and non-flowed Name views,
a vertical scroll bar is provided; this scroll bar is disabled if all the
container items are visible in the work area.  A horizontal scroll bar is
used in these views only when the work area is too narrow to allow the widest
container item to be seen in its entirety. If the user changes the window
size to allow the entire widest container item to be seen, the horizontal
scroll bar is removed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
container items are displayed in flowed text and flowed name views, a horizontal
scroll bar is provided; this scroll bar is disabled if all the container
items are visible in the work area. A vertical scroll bar is used in these
views only when the work area is too short to allow the tallest container
item to be seen in its entirety. If the user changes the window size to
allow the entire tallest container item to be seen, the vertical scroll
bar is removed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If container
items are displayed in the Details view, both horizontal and vertical scroll
bars are provided. These scroll bars are disabled if all the container items
are visible in the work area.
<P>

one for each portion of the split window.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
