<H1>Menu Bar and Pull-Down Menus</H1><!-- entering slot 1639 -->
<P>
A typical application uses a menu bar and several pull-down submenus.  The
pull-down submenus ordinarily are hidden, but become visible when the user
makes selections in the menu bar.  Pull-down submenus always are attached
to the menu bar.
<P>
The menu bar is a child of the frame window; the menu bar window handle
is the key to communicating with the menu bar and its submenus.  You can
retrieve this handle by calling WinWindowFromID, with the handle of the
parent window and the FID_MENU frame-control identifier.  Most messages
for the menu bar and its submenus can be issued to the menu-bar window.
 Flags in the messages tell the window whether to search submenus for requested
menu items.
