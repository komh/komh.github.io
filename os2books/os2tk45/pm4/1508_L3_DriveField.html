<H1>Drive Field</H1><!-- entering slot 1541 -->
<P>
The<I> Drive</I> field contains a drop-down list of the logical drives.
This field cannot be edited by the user.
<P>
The<I> Drive</I> field displays the value passed in the<I> papszIDriveList
</I>field of the FILEDLG data structure. If the application does not specify
a drive list, all drives currently available on the system are displayed.
When the drop-down list is displayed, the current drive is highlighted.
When the user selects a drive, the display is refreshed. When either the
user-specified drive or the default drive has a volume label, the volume
label is displayed also.
<P>
Users can access networked files by associating logical disks with remote
servers, or they can enter the name and ID of the server in the<I> File
Name</I> field. When the server name entered is not found in the Drive drop-down
list, it is added to the list and displayed in the<I> Drive</I> field.
