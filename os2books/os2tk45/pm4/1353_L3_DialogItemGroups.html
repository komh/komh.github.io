<H1>Dialog-Item Groups</H1><!-- entering slot 1378 -->
<P>
Items within a dialog window can be organized into<I> dialog-item groups</I>.
 When items are arranged in a group, the user can move from one item to
another in the same group by using the direction keys.  When the user presses
a direction key, the focus will not shift to items in other groups within
the dialog window.
<P>
Arranging items in groups is useful for radio buttons and check boxes. Although
some control types also can be displayed this way, entry-field controls
cannot; they process direction keys themselves, as do MLE, value-set, container,
slider, and notebook controls.
<P>
The first item in a dialog-item group has the WS_GROUP window style.  All
subsequent items in the dialog template are considered part of that group
until another item is given the WS_GROUP style, which begins a new group.

<P>
The WS_TABSTOP style often is used along with the WS_GROUP style.  WS_TABSTOP
marks the items that can receive the focus when the user presses the Tab
key.  Each time the user presses the Tab key, the focus moves to the next
item that has the WS_TABSTOP style.  Generally, the WS_GROUP and WS_TABSTOP
styles are defined together for the first item of each group in the dialog
template.  This makes it possible for a user to press the Tab key to move
among groups of items and to use the direction keys to move among items
in a group.
<P>
The WS_TABSTOP style should not be used for radio buttons because the system
automatically maintains a tab stop on any selected item in a radio-button
group; therefore, when the Tab key is pressed in a group of radio buttons,
the focus remains on the currently selected item.
<P>
The WS_GROUP and WS_TABSTOP styles are also useful for preventing the user
from moving to a particular button when using the keyboard.  For example,
if the dialog window has<B> OK</B> and<B> Cancel</B> push buttons, they
should be in the same group, with the<B> OK</B> push button as the first
item in the group.  The user can press Tab to select the<B> OK</B> push
button but not the<B> Cancel</B> push button.  To move to the<B> Cancel
</B>button using the keyboard, the user first must press the Tab key to
move to the<B> OK</B> push button, and then press a direction key to move
the focus to the<B> Cancel</B> push button.
