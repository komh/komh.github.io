<P>
You might want to use menus in windows that were not created using the WinCreateStdWindow
function.  For these windows, you can load a menu resource by using the
WinLoadMenu function and specifying the parent window for the menu.  WinLoadMenu
assigns the specified menu resource to the parent.  To see the menu in the
window, you must send a WM_UPDATEFRAME message to the parent after loading
the menu resource.  This strategy is especially useful for adding menus
to a window created as a dialog window, but it can be used no matter what
type of window is specified as the parent.
