<H1>DDE Termination</H1><!-- entering slot 1496 -->
<P>
At any time, either the client or the server may terminate an exchange by
issuing a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message. Similarly, both the client application
and server application must be able to receive a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message
at any time.
<P>
An application must end its exchanges before terminating. The application
posts a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message with a zero-length shared-memory pointer.
A WM_DDE_TERMINATE message stops all transactions for a given exchange.

<P>
The WM_DDE_TERMINATE message means that the sender sends no further messages
in that exchange and that the recipient can destroy its DDE window. The
recipient must always send a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message promptly in response;
it is not permissible to send a negative, busy, or positive WM_DDE_ACK message
instead.
<P>
If the original sender of the termination request receives any other message
before the WM_DDE_TERMINATE message arrives from the recipient of the request,
it should not respond, because the sender of the other message might have
already destroyed the window to which the response would be sent.
