<P>
An application can retrieve the number of lines of text in an MLE field
by using the MLM_QUERYLINECOUNT message and can retrieve the number of characters
in the MLE field by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTLENGTH message. The amount of
text and, subsequently, the number of lines to be entered in an MLE field
depend on the text limit. An application sets the text limit by using the
MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT message and determines the current limit by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTLIMIT
message. The user cannot set the text limit.  If the user types to the text
limit, the MLE field control beeps and ignores any subsequent keystrokes.
If the application attempts to add text beyond the limit, the MLE field
control truncates the text.
<P>
An application can control the length of each line in an MLE field by enabling
word wrapping. When word wrapping is enabled, the MLE field control automatically
breaks any line that is longer than the width of the MLE field. An application
can set word wrapping by using the MLM_SETWRAP message, and it can determine
whether the MLE field control is wrapping text by using the MLM_QUERYWRAP
message. Word wrapping is disabled by default unless the application specifies
the MLS_WORDWRAP style when creating the MLE field control.
<P>
An application can set tab stops for an MLE control by using the MLM_SETTABSTOP
message. Tab stops specify the maximum width of a tab character. When the
user or an application inserts a tab character, the MLE field control expands
the character so that it fills the space between the cursor position and
the next tab stop. The MLM_SETTABSTOP message sets the distance (in pels)
between tab stops, and the MLE field control provides as many tab stops
as necessary, no matter how long the line gets. An application can retrieve
the distance between tab stops using the MLM_QUERYTABSTOP message.
<P>
An application can use the MLM_SETFORMATRECT message to set the<I> format
rectangle</I> (MLE field). The format rectangle is used to set the horizontal
and vertical limits for text. The MLE control sends a notification message
to the parent window of the MLE field if text exceeds either of those limits.
An application typically uses the format rectangle to provide its own word
wrapping or other special text processing. An application can retrieve the
current format rectangle by using the MLM_QUERYFORMATRECT message.
<P>
An application can prevent the user's editing of the MLE field by setting
the MLS_READONLY style in WinCreateWindow or in the MLE statement in the
resource-definition file. The application also can set and query the read-only
state by using the MLM_SETREADONLY and MLM_QUERYREADONLY messages, respectively.

<P>
An application can set the colors and font for an MLE field by using the
MLM_SETTEXTCOLOR, MLM_SETBACKCOLOR, and MLM_SETFONT messages. These messages
affect all text in the MLE field. An MLE field cannot contain a mixture
of fonts and colors. An application can retrieve the current values for
the colors and font by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTCOLOR, MLM_QUERYBACKCOLOR,
and MLM_QUERYFONT messages.
<P>
To prevent scrolling within the MLE when the MLS_READONLY style bit is set,
use the MLM_DISABLEREFRESH message. The keyboard and mouse input can be
enabled using the MLM_ENABLEREFRESH message.
