<H1>Providing Target Emphasis</H1><!-- entering slot 1457 -->
<P>
The target should provide target emphasis so the user knows exactly where
the drop occurs or, if the drop is not allowed, the boundaries of the region
where the drop is not allowed.
<P>
A container window should emphasize a target object by drawing a thin, black
rectangle around it. The application should use DrgGetPS and DrgReleasePS
to obtain the presentation space in which to draw target emphasis.
