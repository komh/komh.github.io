<H1>Using Buttons in a Dialog Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1272 -->
<P>
You can define dialog-window buttons as part of a dialog template in a resource-definition
file, as shown in the following Resource Compiler source-code fragment.

<PRE>
    DLGTEMPLATE IDD_BUTTON
    BEGIN
        DIALOG  "", 2, 10, 10, 235, 180, WS_VISIBLE, FCF_DLGBORDER
        BEGIN
            AUTORADIOBUTTON "Radio~1", ID_RADIO1, 15, 80, 45, 12, WS_GROUP
            AUTORADIOBUTTON "Radio~2", ID_RADIO2, 15, 60, 45, 12
            AUTORADIOBUTTON "Radio~3", ID_RADIO3, 15, 40, 45, 12
            AUTORADIOBUTTON "Radio~4", ID_RADIO4, 15, 20, 45, 12

            PUSHBUTTON "Button 1", ID_PUSH1,  20  100, 50, 14, WS_GROUP
            PUSHBUTTON "Button 2", ID_PUSH2,  75, 100, 50, 14, WS_GROUP
            PUSHBUTTON "Button 3", ID_PUSH3, 130, 100, 50, 14, WS_GROUP

            CHECKBOX "Check Box 1",     ID_CHECK1, 150, 65, 65, 12, WS_GROUP
            CHECKBOX "no toggle",       ID_CHECK2, 150, 40, 58, 12, WS_GROUP
            AUTOCHECKBOX "Check Box 3", ID_CHECK3, 150, 20, 65, 12, WS_GROUP

            DEFPUSHBUTTON "OK",         DID_OK,     75, 26, 46, 20, WS_GROUP
        END
    END

Each button in a dialog window has an identifier (for example, ID_RADIO1)
that allows an application to identify the source of the WM_COMMAND and
WM_CONTROL messages.  An application can use the identifier as the second
argument of the WinWindowFromID function to retrieve the button-window handle.

<P>
The dialog template also contains the text for each button.  For push buttons,
this text is displayed in a rectangular box.  If the text is too long to
fit in the box, the text is clipped.  For radio buttons and check boxes,
text is displayed to the right of the button.  A user selects the button
by clicking either the button or the text itself.
<P>
The WS_GROUP style identifies the beginning of each new group of buttons.
 In the preceding example, the four auto-radio buttons are in the same group,
and each of the other buttons is in its own group.  The auto-radio buttons
in the first group can be selected one at a time only.  An application must
ensure that only one check box in a group is selected at a time.  The order
in which items can be selected in the group can wrap around from the end
of the item list to its beginning.
<P>
Notice that the DEFPUSHBUTTON style in the preceding example has the identifier
DID_OK. It is customary to include an<B> OK</B> button with this identifier
in most dialog windows to provide a uniform user interface. The DEFPUSHBUTTON
style draws a thick border around a button and allows a user to select the
button by pressing the spacebar.
<P>
The dialog-window procedure for a dialog window that contains buttons must
respond to WM_COMMAND and WM_CONTROL messages. A common strategy is to use
auto-radio buttons and auto-check boxes to let the user set a list of capabilities
for a command, and, then, let the user execute the command by choosing an
<B>OK</B> push button.  With this strategy, the dialog-window procedure
ignores all WM_CONTROL messages that come from auto-radio buttons and auto-check
boxes.  When the dialog-window procedure receives a WM_COMMAND message for
the<B> OK</B> push button, the procedure should query the auto-radio buttons
and auto-check boxes to determine which options have been selected.
