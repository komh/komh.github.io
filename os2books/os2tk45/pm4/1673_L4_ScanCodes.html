<P>
A third possible value in a WM_CHAR message is the scan code of the key
that was pressed.  The scan code represents the value that the keyboard
hardware generates when the user presses a key.  An application can use
the scan code to identify the physical key pressed, as opposed to the character
code represented by the same key.
