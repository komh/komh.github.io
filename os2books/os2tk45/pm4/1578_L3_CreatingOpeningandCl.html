<H1>Creating, Opening, and Closing Initialization Files</H1><!-- entering slot 1613 -->
<P>
You can create an initialization file or open an existing initialization
file by using the PrfOpenProfile function.  The function requires a handle
to an anchor block and a pointer to the name of an initialization file.
 If the file does not exist in the given path, the function automatically
creates an initialization file.
<P>
The following code fragment creates an initialization file named<I> pmtools.ini
</I>in the current directory:
<P>

<PRE>    HAB hab;
    HINI hini;

    hab = WinInitialize(0);
    if ((hini = PrfOpenProfile(hab, "pmtools.ini")) == NULL){
                         .
                         . /* File was not created */
                         .
       }

</PRE>

<P>
If the PrfOpenProfile function is successful, it returns a handle to the
initialization file.  Otherwise, it returns NULL, and the file is not created.
 Once you have an initialization-file handle, you can create new sections
and settings in the file.
<P>
To close an initialization file, you use the PrfCloseProfile function.
