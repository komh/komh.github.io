<H1>Details View</H1><!-- entering slot 1313 -->
<P>
The Details view (CV_DETAIL attribute) of the container control can display
the following data types to represent container item: icons or bit maps,
text, numbers, dates, and times. CV_DETAIL is an attribute of the CNRINFO
data structure's<I> flWindowAttr</I> field.
<P>
The data is arranged in columns, which can have headings. Each column can
contain data that belongs to only one of the valid data types. Column headings
can contain text, icons, or bit maps.
<P>
The width of each column can be explicitly specified in the<I> cxWidth</I> field
of the FIELDINFO data structure. If a column width is not specified, it
is determined by the widest entry in the column.
<P>
Columns can be inserted or removed dynamically. All of the columns in a
given row belong to a single container item; selecting the data portion
of a row selects the entire row, not just the individual column.
<P>
Details view column headings and data can be top- or bottom-justified or
vertically centered, as well as left- or right-justified or horizontally
centered. In addition, horizontal separator lines can be specified between
the column headings and the data; vertical separator lines can be placed
between columns.
