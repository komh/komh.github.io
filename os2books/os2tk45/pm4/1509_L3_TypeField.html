<H1>Type Field</H1><!-- entering slot 1542 -->
<P>
The<I> Type</I> field contains a drop-down list of extended-attribute filters.

<P>
The<I> Type</I> field displays the value passed in the<I> pszIType</I> field
of the FILEDLG data structure. The current setting is highlighted when the
drop-down list is displayed.
<P>
When a type filter is not specified by the application, &lt;All Files&gt;
is displayed and no extended-attribute type filtering is used with the initial
display.
<P>
All files affected by the string filter and the extended-attribute type
filter criteria are displayed, based on how the filters are to be used.
The default is that all file names meeting the intersection of the two filters
are shown. When users change the value in the<I> Type</I> field, the File
list box is updated to display a list of files that meet the new type filter
criteria. Files that meet both the string filter and extended-attribute
type filter are displayed.
<P>
