<H1>Scrolling the Contents of a Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1479 -->
<P>
An application typically responds to a click in a scroll bar by scrolling
the contents of the window.  This operation has three parts. First, the
application changes its internal data-representation state to show what
portion of the image must now be in the window.  Next, the application moves
the current image in the window.  Finally, the application draws in the
area that has been uncovered by the scrolling operation.
<P>
For example, a simple text editor might display a small portion of several
pages of text in a window.  When the user clicks the Down arrow of the vertical
scroll bar, the application moves all the text up one line and displays
the next line at the bottom of the window.
<P>
This clicking also causes a message to be sent to the client window of the
frame window that owns the scroll bar.  The application responds to this
message by changing its internal data-representation state to show which
line of text is topmost in the window, scrolling the text in the window
up one line, and drawing the new line at the bottom of the window.  There
normally is no need to completely redraw the entire window, because the
scrolled portion of the image remains valid.
<P>
You can use the WinScrollWindow function to scroll the contents of your
application windows.  WinScrollWindow scrolls a specified rectangular area
of the window by a specified x and y offset (in window coordinates).  If
you set the SW_INVALIDATERGN flag for this function, the areas you uncover
by scrolling are added to the window's update region automatically, causing
a WM_PAINT message for the areas to be sent to the window.
<P>
For example, as used in the simple text editor described previously, the
following call scrolls the text up one line (assuming that the<I> iVScrollInc
</I>parameter specifies the height of the current font) and adds the uncovered
area at the bottom of the window to the update region.
<P>

<PRE>    HWND hwnd;
    LONG iVScrollInc;

    /* Scroll, adding a new area to the update region.          */

    WinScrollWindow(hwnd,  /* Window handle                     */
        0,                 /* x displacement                    */
        -(iVScrollInc),    /* y displacement                    */
        (PRECTL) NULL,     /* Scroll rectangle is entire window */
        (PRECTL) NULL,     /* Clip rectangle is entire window   */
        (HRGN) NULL,       /* Update region                     */
        (PRECTL) NULL,     /* Update rectangle                  */
        SW_INVALIDATERGN); /* Scroll-window flag                */

</PRE>

<P>
When the uncovered area is added to the window's update region, a WM_PAINT
message is sent to the window.  Upon receiving the message, the window draws
the line of text at the bottom of the window.  If the window has the WS_SYNCPAINT
style, the WM_PAINT message is sent to the window before WinScrollWindow
returns.
<P>
To optimize scrolling speed for repeated scrolling operations, you can omit
the SW_INVALIDATERGN flag from the call to WinScrollWindow, which prevents
the function from adding the invalid region (uncovered by the scroll) to
the window's update region.  If you omit the SW_INVALIDATERGN flag, you
must pass a region or rectangle to WinScrollWindow.  The rectangle or region
will contain the area that must be updated after scrolling.
