<H1>Drawing Text</H1><!-- entering slot 1481 -->
<P>
There are many ways to draw text in a window in an OS/2 application.  The
simplest way is to use the WinDrawText function, which draws a single line
of text in a specified rectangle, using a variety of alignment methods.

<P>
WinDrawText allows you to set a flag so that the function does not draw
any text; instead, the function returns the number of characters in the
string that will fit in the specified rectangle.  For a section of running
text, an application can alternate between computation and calls to WinDrawText
to draw successive lines of text.  When performing this kind of repetitive
operation, you can set the DT_WORDBREAK flag in the WinDrawText function
to put line breaks on word boundaries rather than between arbitrary characters.
