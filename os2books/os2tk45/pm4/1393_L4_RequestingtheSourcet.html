<H1>Requesting the Source to Render the Item</H1><!-- entering slot 1419 -->
<P>
Whenever the conditions for a target to do the rendering operation without
source participation are not met, the target must request the source to
carry out the rendering by posting a DM_RENDER message to the source. Of
course, the target can do this even if it is able to carry out the rendering
mechanism on its own.
