<H1>Modal and Modeless Dialog Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 1376 -->
<P>
Dialog windows can be modal or modeless.  A<I> modal</I> dialog window requires
that the dialog window be dismissed before the user can activate other windows
in the same application.  Generally, an application uses a modal dialog
window to get essential information from the user before proceeding with
an operation.  A<I> modeless</I> dialog window allows the user to activate
other windows in the same application without dismissing the dialog window.
 Both modal and modeless dialog windows allow the user to activate windows
in another application before responding to the dialog window.
<P>
Modal dialog windows are easier for an application to manage because they
are created, perform their task, and are closed, all with a single function
call.
<P>
Modeless dialog windows require more attention from the application because
they exist until explicitly dismissed.  Modeless dialog windows provide
a more flexible interface, however, by allowing the user to move to other
windows in the application before responding to the dialog window.
