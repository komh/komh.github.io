<H1>Native Rendering Mechanism and Format</H1><!-- entering slot 1449 -->
<P>
The native rendering mechanism and format of the object is the mechanism
that most naturally conveys the data and its current format. For example,
the native rendering mechanism and format for a:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->C source file might be    "&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,CF_OEMTEXT&gt;"
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Spreadsheet file might be "&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,CF_SYLK&gt;"
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In some direct-manipulation operations, it might be possible for the target
to carry out the necessary action on the source object without the source's
participation. However, this is possible only when the target supports both
the true type and the native rendering mechanism and format of the object.
Even when the target is not performing the necessary action on the source
object, it is still important to know the native rendering mechanism and
format. In determining the rendering mechanism and format to be used in
the data exchange after the drop, the target might select the native format
because, generally, performance is better when the native rendering mechanism
and format are used.
<P>
The native rendering mechanism and format are conveyed to the target by
making it the first ordered pair, or the first ordered pair to result from
a cross product, in the list of rendering mechanisms and formats passed
in the DRAGINFO data structure.
