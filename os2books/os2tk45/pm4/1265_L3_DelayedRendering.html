<H1>Delayed Rendering</H1><!-- entering slot 1286 -->
<P>
An application can pass NULL as the<I> ulData</I> parameter of the WinSetClipbrdData
function instead of a pointer or a handle.  This indicates that the data
is rendered only when another application requests it from the clipboard.
 This is useful if an application supports several clipboard formats that
are time-consuming to render.  With delayed rendering, an application can
send NULL handles for each clipboard format that it supports and render
individual formats only when the format actually is requested from the clipboard.
 An application can either write data for standard formats or choose delayed
rendering for more complex formats.
<P>
When an application uses delayed rendering for one or more of its clipboard
formats, it must become the clipboard owner.  As long as the application
is the clipboard owner, it receives a WM_RENDERFMT message whenever a request
is received by the clipboard for a format using delayed rendering.  When
the application receives such a message, it renders the data and passes
the pointer or handle to the clipboard by calling the WinSetClipbrdData
function.  The rules for shared-memory access for rendered data are the
same as those for standard clipboard data.  This simply is a delayed execution
of the operation that occurs if the data does not have delayed rendering.

<P>
The clipboard owner, with one or more delayed-rendering formats on the clipboard,
receives a WM_RENDERALLFMTS message just before the clipboard-owner application
terminates.  This ensures that the application renders all of its data before
terminating.
