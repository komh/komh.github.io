<H1>DDE Initiation</H1><!-- entering slot 1489 -->
<P>
A client application initiates a DDE conversation by calling WinDdeInitiate,
specifying the server application-name string and the topic-name string.
WinDdeInitiate fills a DDEINIT data structure with the specified strings,
then sends a WM_DDE_INITIATE message to all frame windows that have HWND_DESKTOP
as their parent. The message contains the handle of the client application
and a pointer to the DDEINIT data structure. The following figure illustrates
the DDEINIT data structure:
<PRE>     typedef struct _DDEINIT
     {
       ULONG   cb;
       PSZ     pszAppName;
       PSZ     pszTopic;
       USHORT  usConvContext;
      } DDEINIT;

</PRE>

<P>
Because the message is sent rather than posted, WinDdeInitiate requires
a response from all recipients of the message before it returns control
to the client application.
<P>
Any potential server must contain a<I> server window</I>, a top-level frame
window that has been subclassed to receive and process WM_DDE_INITIATE messages.
When a server window receives WM_DDE_INITIATE, it examines the application-name
and topic-name strings in the DDEINIT data structure. If the application-name
string matches and the server supports the requested topic, the server acknowledges
the client's request.
<P>
Either the application-name or topic-name string can be zero-length. If
the application-name string is zero-length, all servers check the topic-name
string. Each server that supports the topic sends a separate acknowledgment
to the client. If the topic-name string is zero-length, the server sends
an acknowledgment for each supported topic. Using zero-length strings, a
client can obtain the names of all the active servers in the system or the
names of all the topics a server supports.
<P>
The following pseudocode shows how servers respond to WM_DDE_INITIATE messages:

<PRE>    If (specific app requested and server is instance of app) or
       (specific app not requested)
    {

         If (specific topic requested)
              If (server can support topic)

                   acknowledge the requested topic

         else
              acknowledge each supported topic
    }

</PRE>

<P>
A server acknowledges its support of a specific topic by calling WinDdeRespond,
specifying the handle of its server window, its application name, and the
name of the supported topic. WinDdeRespond fills a DDEINIT data structure
with the specified strings, then sends a WM_DDE_INITIATEACK message to the
client. The message contains the handle of the server window and a pointer
to the DDEINIT data structure.  The client examines the topic-name string
in the DDEINIT data structure and decides whether to begin a transaction
on the topic.
<P>
If two applications agree on some unspecified protocol and can exchange
window handles by some means, they can use DDE messages on those window
handles without going through an initiate sequence.
<P>
An application does not need to fill in a DDEINIT data structure; WinDdeInitiate
and WinDdeRespond automatically fill the data structure. However, applications
must extract the application name and topic name from the DDEINIT data structure
when receiving a WM_DDE_INITIATE or WM_DDE_INITIATEACK message.
