<H1>HK_JOURNALRECORD - Journal Record Hook</H1><!-- entering slot 1591 -->
<P>
The<I> journal record hook</I> allows an application to monitor the system-message
queue and to record input events. Typically, an application uses this hook
to record a sequence of mouse and keyboard events that it can play back
later by using the journal playback hook. A journal record hook function
can be associated only with the system-message queue. The following code
shows the syntax for a journal record hook function:
<PRE>VOID EXPENTRY JournalRecordHook(HAB hab, PQMSG pQmsg)

</PRE>

<P>
The<I> pQmsg</I> parameter is a pointer to a QMSG data structure containing
information about the message. The system calls the journal record hook
function after processing the raw input enough to create valid WM_CHAR or
mouse messages and after setting the<I> window-handle</I> field of the QMSG
data structure.
<P>
A journal record hook function does not return a value, and the system always
calls the next function in the chain. Typically, a journal record hook function
saves the input events to a disk file to be played back later. The<I> hwnd
</I>field of the QMSG data structure is not important and is ignored when
the message is played back.
<P>
The following messages are passed to the journal record hook:
<PRE>        WM_CHAR
        WM_BUTTON1DOWN
        WM_BUTTON1UP
        WM_BUTTON2DOWN
        WM_BUTTON2UP
        WM_BUTTON3DOWN
        WM_BUTTON3UP
        WM_MOUSEMOVE.
</PRE>

<P>
The positions stored in the mouse messages are in screen coordinates. The
system does not combine mouse clicks into double clicks before calling the
hook, because there is no guarantee that both clicks will be in the same
window when they are played back.
<P>
The system passes a WM_JOURNALNOTIFY message to the journal record hook
function whenever an application calls WinGetPhysKeyState or WinQueryQueueStatus.
This message is necessary because the system-message queue is only one message
deep while a playback hook is active. For example, the user might press
the A, B, and C keys while in record mode. While the application is processing
the<I> A</I> character message, the B key might be down; WinGetPhysKeyState
returns this information. However, during playback mode, the system knows
only that it currently is processing the A key.
