<H1>Dialog Items</H1><!-- entering slot 1377 -->
<P>
A<I> dialog item</I> is a child window of the dialog window, which usually
is a window of class WC_FRAME.  The operating system provides many predefined
window classes, called<I> control windows</I>, that you can use as dialog
items. Predefined control windows include static display boxes, text-entry
fields, buttons, and list boxes.  You also can use customized window classes
as dialog items.
<P>
Dialog items are windows and, thus, can be manipulated by all window-management
functions relating to size, position, and visibility.  Dialog items always
are owned by the dialog frame window.  Most predefined control-window classes
send notification messages to their owners when the user interacts with
their control windows.  The dialog frame window receives these notification
messages and passes them to the application through the application-defined
dialog procedure.
