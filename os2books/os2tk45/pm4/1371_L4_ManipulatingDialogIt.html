<H1>Manipulating Dialog Items</H1><!-- entering slot 1397 -->
<P>
Dialog items are control windows and, as such, can be manipulated using
standard window-management function calls.  The window handle is obtained
for each dialog item by calling the WinWindowFromID function and passing
the window handle for the dialog window and the window identifier for the
dialog item as defined in the dialog template.  Include the following Resource
Compiler source-code fragment in your dialog template:
<P>

<PRE>
    DLGTEMPLATE IDD_ABOUT
    BEGIN
        DIALOG "", IDD_ABOUT, 80, 92, 126, 130, FS_DLGBORDER, 0
        BEGIN
            PUSHBUTTON "My Button", ITEMID_MYBUTTON, 37, 107, 56, 12

            /* Other item definitions ... */

        END
    END

</PRE>

<P>
Based on this code fragment, your application will receive the button-item
handle by initiating the following call to WinWindowFromID:
<P>

<PRE>
    hwndItem = WinWindowFromID(hwndDialog, ITEMID_MYBUTTON);

</PRE>

<P>
Applications often change the contents, enabled state, or position of dialog
items at run time.  For example, in a dialog window that contains a list
box of file names and an<B> Open</B> button, the<B> Open</B> button should
be disabled until the user selects a file from the list.  To do this, define
the button as disabled in the dialog resource so that it is disabled when
the dialog window first is displayed.  At run time, the dialog procedure
receives a notification message from the list box when the user selects
a file.  At that time, the dialog procedure should call the WinEnableWindow
function to enable the<B> Open</B> button.
<P>
Applications also can change the text in static dialog items and buttons
by calling the WinSetWindowText function and using the window handle of
a particular dialog item.
