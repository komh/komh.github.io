<H1>HK_JOURNALPLAYBACK - Journal Playback Hook</H1><!-- entering slot 1590 -->
<P>
The<I> journal playback hook</I> enables an application to insert messages
into the system-message queue. Typically, an application uses this hook
to play back a series of mouse and keyboard events that were recorded earlier
using the journal record hook. A journal playback hook function can be associated
only with the system-message queue.
<P>
Regular mouse and keyboard input is disabled as long as a journal playback
hook is installed. It is important to notice that, because mouse and keyboard
input are disabled, this hook can easily hang the system. The following
code shows the syntax for a journal playback hook function:
<PRE>ULONG EXPENTRY JournalPlaybackHook(HAB hab, BOOL fSkip,
                                   PQMSG pQmsg)

</PRE>

<P>
The<I> pQmsg</I> parameter is a pointer to a QMSG data structure that the
journal playback hook function fills in with the message to be played back.
If the<I> fSkip</I> parameter is FALSE, the function fills in the QMSG data
structure with the current recorded message. The function returns the same
message each time it is called, until<I> fSkip</I> is TRUE. The same message
is returned many times if an application is examining the queue but not
removing the message. If<I> fSkip</I> is TRUE, the function advances to
the next message without filling in the QMSG data structure, because the
<I>pQmsg</I> parameter is NULL when<I> fSkip</I> is TRUE.
<P>
The journal playback hook returns a ULONG time-out value that tells the
system how many milliseconds to wait before processing the current message
from the playback hook. This enables the hook to control the timing of the
events it plays back.
<P>
The<I> time</I> field of the QMSG data structure is filled in with the current
time before the playback hook is called. The hook should use the time stored
in this field, instead of the system clock, to set up delays between events.
