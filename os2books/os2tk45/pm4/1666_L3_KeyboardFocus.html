<H1>Keyboard Focus</H1><!-- entering slot 1703 -->
<P>
The<I> keyboard focus</I> is a temporary attribute of a window; the window
that has the keyboard focus receives all keyboard input until the focus
changes to a different window.  The system converts keyboard input events
into WM_CHAR messages and posts them to the message queue of the window
that has the keyboard focus.
<P>
An application can set the keyboard focus to a particular window by calling
WinSetFocus.  If the application does not use WinSetFocus to explicitly
set the keyboard-focus window, the system sets the focus to the active frame
window.
<P>
The following events occur when an application uses WinSetFocus to shift
the keyboard focus from one window (the<I> original</I> window) to another
(the<I> new</I> window):<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The system sends the original window a WM_SETFOCUS
message (with the<I> fFocus</I> parameter set to FALSE), indicating that
that window has lost the keyboard focus.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The system then sends the original window a WM_SETSELECTION
message, indicating that the window should remove the highlight from the
current selection.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the original (frame) window is being deactivated,
the system sends it a WM_ACTIVATE message (with the<I> fActive</I> parameter
set to FALSE), indicating that the window is no longer active.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The system then sends the new application a WM_ACTIVATE
message (with<I> fActive</I> set to TRUE), indicating that the new application
is now active.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the new (main) window is being activated,
the system sends it a WM_ACTIVATE message (with<I> fActive</I> set to TRUE),
indicating that the main window is now active.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The system sends the new window a WM_SETSELECTION
message, indicating that the window should highlight the current selection.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finally, the system sends the new window a WM_SETFOCUS
message (with<I> fFocus</I> set to TRUE), indicating that the new window
has the keyboard focus.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If, while processing a WM_SETFOCUS message, an application calls WinQueryActiveWindow,
that function returns the handle of the previously-active window until the
application establishes a new active window.  Similarly, if the application,
while processing WM_SETFOCUS, calls WinQueryFocus, that function returns
the handle of the previous keyboard-focus window until the application establishes
a new keyboard-focus window.  In other words, even though the system has
sent WM_ACTIVATE and WM_SETFOCUS messages (with the<I> fActive</I> and<I> fFocus
</I>parameters set to FALSE) to the previous windows, those windows are
considered the active and focus windows until the system establishes new
active and focus windows.
<P>
If the application calls WinSetFocus while processing a WM_ACTIVATE message,
the system does not send a WM_SETFOCUS message (with<I> fFocus</I> set to
FALSE), because no window has the focus.
<P>
A client window receives a WM_ACTIVATE message when its parent frame window
is being activated or deactivated.  The activation or deactivation message
usually is followed by a WM_SETFOCUS message that specifies whether the
client window is gaining or losing the keyboard focus.  Therefore, if the
client window needs to change the keyboard focus, it should do so during
the WM_SETFOCUS message, not during the WM_ACTIVATE message.
