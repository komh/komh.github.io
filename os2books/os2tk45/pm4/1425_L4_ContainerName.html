<H1>Container Name</H1><!-- entering slot 1451 -->
<P>
Sometimes it is necessary for a target container to know the name of the
source container. This name could carry some location information. For example,
the default operation when dragging objects between containers is a Move.
However, in the case of file folders on different drives, this default would
be changed to a Copy operation. Thus, a file folder would fill this field
with the drive and path information for a file, for example, A:\SUBDIR1\SUBDIR2\.
A database container, on the other hand, might fill this field with the
fully qualified OS/2 file name of the database.
