<H1>About Mouse and Keyboard Input</H1><!-- entering slot 1700 -->
<P>
Only one window at a time can receive keyboard input, and only one window
at a time can receive mouse input; but they do not have to be the same window.
 All keyboard input goes to the window with the input focus, and, normally,
all mouse input goes to the window under the mouse pointer.
