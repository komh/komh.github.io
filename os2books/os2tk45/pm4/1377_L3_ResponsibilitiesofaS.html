<H1>Responsibilities of a Source Application</H1><!-- entering slot 1403 -->
<P>
The source is responsible for starting a direct manipulation operation.
Startup can be accomplished only with a pointing device, such as a mouse.
The operation starts when the application detects that a drag button has
been pressed and the pointing device has moved. Dragging continues until
terminated, which is usually when the button is released.
<P>
Although the direct manipulation protocol lets the application use any button
for dragging, it is recommended that the system-defined drag button be used
for direct manipulation operations.
<P>
The source has the following responsibilities in preparing for the actual
drag of the objects across the screen:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allocate and initialize the DRAGINFO data structure
that conveys the necessary information about each object to the target.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initialize a set of DRAGIMAGE data structures that
describe the image to be displayed during the drag operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make the following information known to the system:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The type of each object being directly manipulated
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The rendering mechanism and format for each object
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The suggested name of the object at the target<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The name of the container or folder containing the
source object<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The name of the object at the source<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The<I> true</I> type of each object being directly
manipulated<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The native rendering mechanism and format for each
object<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
