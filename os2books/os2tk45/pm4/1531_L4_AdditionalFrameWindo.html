<H1>Additional Frame-Window Items</H1><!-- entering slot 1564 -->
<P>
In addition to its frame controls, a frame window also can contain a sizing
border and the minimize and maximize buttons (also known as minimize and
maximize<I> icons</I>).  These items are not frame controls, because the
frame window draws and maintains them.  (<I>Frame controls</I> are windows
that draw and maintain themselves.)
<P>
The sizing border encloses the frame window and lets the user change the
size of the window using a mouse.  The minimize button, at the right end
of the title bar, lets the user reduce the frame window to an icon.  The
maximize button, to the right of the minimize button, lets the user enlarge
the window so that it fills the screen. An application can add these items
to a frame window by using the FCF_SIZEBORDER, FCF_MAXBUTTON, and FCF_MINBUTTON
(or FCF_MINMAX) styles.  (The FCF_MINMAX style adds both a maximize button
and a minimize button.)
