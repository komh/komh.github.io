<P>
Prior to initiating a Pickup and Drop operation (via DrgLazyDrag), DrgAllocDraginfo
must be called to allocate a DRAGINFO data structure. As additional objects
are added to the Pickup set, the DRAGINFO and DRAGITEM data structures must
be reallocated using DrgReallocDraginfo. This function unconditionally frees
the existing DRAGINFO data structure passed to it, reallocates a new DRAGINFO
data structure, and returns the pointer to the new data structure. The Pickup
and Drop operation is then re-inititiated by another DrgLazyDrag call.
<P>
The DRAGIMAGE array is passed to DrgLazyDrag, so that compatibility with
the drag operation is maintained. This allows the application to support
Pickup and Drop, and standard drag operation with the same code. However,
the drag images in the data structure are not used for display during Pickup
and Drop, as the mouse pointer is augmented with a Pickup icon during the
operation. As soon as DrgLazyDrag returns, the DRAGIMAGE array can be freed.
