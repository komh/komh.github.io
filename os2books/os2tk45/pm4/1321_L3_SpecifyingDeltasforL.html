<H1>Specifying Deltas for Large Amounts of Data</H1><!-- entering slot 1343 -->
<P>
The container control can accommodate large amounts of data with an application-defined
delta. The<I> delta</I> is an application-defined threshold, or number of
container items, from either end of the list. The application is responsible
for specifying the delta value in the CNRINFO data structure's<I> cDelta
</I>field. It also is responsible for setting the delta value with the CMA_DELTA
attribute of the CM_SETCNRINFO message's<I> ulCnrInfoFl</I> parameter.
<P>
The container control monitors its place in the list of container items
when the user is scrolling through it. When the user scrolls to the delta
from either end of the list, the container control sends a CN_QUERYDELTA
notification code to the application as a request for more container items
in the list.
<P>
The application is responsible for managing the records in the container.
When the application receives the CN_QUERYDELTA notification code, the application
is responsible for removing and inserting container records by using the
CM_REMOVERECORD message and the CM_INSERTRECORD message, respectively.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The delta concept is intended for applications with large amounts of data,
or several thousand records. Applications with smaller amounts of data are
not required to use the delta function. The default delta value is 0.
<P>
The delta function is not available in the Icon view because it is intended
for data displayed in a linear format.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
