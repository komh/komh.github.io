<H1>Workspace and Work Area Origins</H1><!-- entering slot 1339 -->
<P>
When the container is created, the work area and workspace share the same
origin, (0,0). If the application requires that the work area and the workspace
have different origins, the application can use the<I> ptlOrigin</I> field
of the CNRINFO data structure and the CM_SETCNRINFO message to set the origin
of the work area. The application can use the CM_QUERYCNRINFO and CM_SETCNRINFO
messages to obtain the origin when the user ends the application and to
reset the origins when the user restarts the application.
<P>
Container items are located in reference to the workspace origin. There
is a visual shift as the work area is scrolled; however, because the work
area moves over a fixed workspace, the coordinates of the container items
do not change.
