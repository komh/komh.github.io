<H1>System Menu</H1><!-- entering slot 1641 -->
<P>
The system menu in the upper-left corner of a standard frame window is different
from the menus defined by the application.  The system menu is controlled
and defined almost exclusively by the system; your only decision about it
is whether to include it when creating a frame window.  (It is unusual for
a frame window<I> not</I> to include a system menu.)  The system menu generates
WM_SYSCOMMAND messages instead of WM_COMMAND messages.  Most applications
simply use the default behavior for WM_SYSCOMMAND messages, although applications
can add, delete, and change system-menu entries.
