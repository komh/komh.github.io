<H1>Preventing a Target from Rendering an Item</H1><!-- entering slot 1418 -->
<P>
A source can prevent a target from doing the rendering operation on its
own by not providing the source name for the object. This may be a necessary
action for sources that implement some type of security, or that may not
allow particular operations to be performed for an object move. When a source
takes this course, it must fill in the<I> hstrSourceName</I> in the DRAGITEM
data structure before replying to a DM_RENDER message. The target deletes
the<I> hstrSourceName</I> string handle prior to freeing the DRAGINFO data
structure, just as it would if the information had been passed to it at
the time of the drop.
