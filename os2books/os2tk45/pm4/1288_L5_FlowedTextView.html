If the text strings are flowed (CV_TEXT | CV_FLOW), the container appears.
In this case, the text strings fill the leftmost column until the depth
of the work area is reached. The text strings then wrap to form another
column immediately to the right of the filled column. This process is repeated
until all the text strings are positioned in columns.
<P>
The width of each column is determined by the widest text string within
the column. The height of the work area is determined by the size of the
window.
