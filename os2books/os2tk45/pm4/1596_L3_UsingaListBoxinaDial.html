<P>
List boxes most commonly are used in dialog windows.  A list box in a dialog
box is a control window, like a push button or an entry field.  Typically,
the application defines a list box as one item in a dialog template in the
resource-definition file, as shown in the following resource compiler source-code
fragment.
<PRE>
    DLGTEMPLATE IDD_OPEN
    BEGIN
       DIALOG "Open...", IDD_OPEN, 35, 35, 150, 135,
                FS_DLGBORDER, FCF_TITLEBAR
          BEGIN
              LISTBOX        IDD_FILELIST, 15, 15, 90, 90
              PUSHBUTTON     "Drive", IDD_DRIVEBUTTON, 115, 70, 30, 14
              DEFPUSHBUTTON  "Open", IDD_OPENBUTTON, 115, 40, 30, 14
              PUSHBUTTON     "Cancel", IDD_CANCELBUTTON, 115, 15, 30, 14
          END
    END

</PRE>

<P>
Once the dialog resource is defined, the application loads and displays
the dialog box as it would normally.  The application inserts items into
the list when processing the WM_INITDLG message.
<P>
A dialog window with a list box usually has an<B> OK</B> button.  The user
can select items in the list, and then indicate a final selection by double-clicking,
pressing Enter, or clicking the<B> OK</B> button.  When the dialog-window
procedure receives a message indicating that the user has clicked the<B> OK
</B>button, it queries the list box to determine the current selection (or
selections, if the list allows multiple selections), and then responds as
though it had received a WM_CONTROL message with the LN_ENTER notification
code.
