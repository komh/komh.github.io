<P>
To directly manipulate an object, both the source and the target must support
the object<I> type</I>, which describes the format of the object. For example,
the input to a C compiler could have the type<I> Plain Text</I> (DRT_TEXT).
The<I> hstrType</I> field in the DRAGITEM data structure conveys this information
for each object being dragged. The type is represented by a string handle.
The target should check to see if it supports the type before allowing the
user to drop the object.
<P>
Several DTYP_* constants are defined as<I> notational conveniences</I> for
common types of data. An application can extend these types by defining
its own character strings and then creating string handles for them using
DrgAddStrHandle.
