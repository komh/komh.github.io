<P>
In the hook lists associated with most message-monitoring hooks, the function
addresses are linked to form chains. The system passes a message to each
hook function in the list, one after the other. Each function can modify
the message or stop its progress through the chain, thereby preventing it
from reaching the next hook or the destination window. The system calls
chained hook functions in last-installed, first-called order.
