<P>
If the target understands the native rendering mechanism and format of the
object, it may be possible to render the object without any involvement
on the part of the source, provided the source has given the target sufficient
information to do so. In order for the rendering to be performed by the
target, the source must fill in, at a minimum, the<I> hstrContainerName
</I>and<I> hstrSourceName</I> fields. The<I> hstrContainerName</I> field
represents the subdirectory that the file indicated by<I> hstrSourceName
</I>is in. For the target to do the rendering on its own, the true type
of the object must be DTYP_OS2FILE. When these conditions are met, the target
may proceed with the operation. When the operation is complete, the target
must send a DM_ENDCONVERSATION message to the window indicated by<I> hwndItem
</I>in the DRAGITEM data structure.
