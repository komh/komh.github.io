<H1>About Cursors</H1><!-- entering slot 1367 -->
<P>
Only one cursor appears on the screen at a time-either marking the text-insertion
point (a<I> text cursor</I>) or indicating which items the user can interact
with from the keyboard (a<I> selection cursor</I>).  For example, when an
entry field has the keyboard focus, it displays a blinking vertical bar
to show the text-insertion point; however, when a button has the keyboard
focus, the cursor appears as a halftone rectangle the size of the button.
 The operating system draws and blinks the cursor, freeing the application
from handling these details.  Notice that the cursor has no direct relationship
with the mouse pointer.
