<P>
Container items can be anything that your application or a user might store
in a container. Examples are executable programs, word processing files,
graphic images, and database records.
<P>
Container item data is stored in the RECORDCORE and MINIRECORDCORE data
structures. Both the application and the container have access to the data
stored in these records.
<P>
The application must allocate memory for each record by using the CM_ALLOCRECORD
message.
<P>
The maximum number of records is limited only by the amount of memory in
the user's computer. The container control does not limit the number of
records that a container can have.
