<H1>Application-Defined Drag Operations</H1><!-- entering slot 1400 -->
<P>
At times it may be useful for an application to define its own drag operation
to facilitate functions between two windows in the same application or between
closely related applications. For example, an application implementing a
keyboard remapping function may want to provide a method of redefining keys
with direct manipulation. This application could define an operation whereby
dragging one key to another exchanges the definitions of the two keys. The
protocol provides the extendability to enable this kind of function.
