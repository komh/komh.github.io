<H1>Creating a Dialog Procedure</H1><!-- entering slot 1395 -->
<P>
In contrast to window procedures, which receive WM_CREATE messages, dialog
procedures receive WM_INITDLG messages, which are sent after a dialog window
is created, but before it is displayed.  WM_INITDLG can do the same type
of initialization tasks that WM_CREATE handles, but is not the first message
that is received.
<P>
For example, if a dialog window contains a list box, use WM_INITDLG to fill
the list box with items.  Also use this procedure to enable or disable buttons
in a dialog window, depending on your application.
<P>
You also can call the WinSetDlgItemText or WinSetDlgItemShort functions
during dialog initialization, to set up text items that reflect the current
conditions in your application.
<P>
Another typical task for the WM_INITDLG message handler is centering a dialog
window on the screen or within its owner window.  The following code fragment
illustrates how to center a dialog window on the screen using WM_INITDLG:

<P>

<PRE>    RECTL rclScreen,rclDialog;
    LONG  sWidth,sHeight,sBLCx,sBLCy;

    case WM_INITDLG:
        /* Center the dialog window and get the screen rectangle.   */
        WinQueryWindowRect(HWND_DESKTOP, &amp;rclScreen);

        /* Get the dialog-window rectangle.                         */
        WinQueryWindowRect(hwnd, &amp;rclDialog);

        /* Get the dialog-window width.                             */
        sWidth = (LONG) (rclDialog.xRight - rclDialog.xLeft);

        /* Get the dialog-window height.                            */
        sHeight = (LONG) (rclDialog.yTop - rclDialog.yBottom);

        /* Set the horizontal coordinate of the lower-left corner.  */
        sBLCx = ((LONG) rclScreen.xRight - sWidth) / 2;

        /* Set vertical coordinate of the lower-left corner.        */
        sBLCy = ((LONG) rclScreen.yTop - sHeight) / 2;

        /* Move, size, and show the window.                         */
        WinSetWindowPos(hwnd,
            HWND_TOP,
            sBLCx, sBLCy,
            0, 0,          /* Ignores size arguments                */
            SWP_MOVE);

        return 0;
</PRE>

<P>
The dialog procedure receives notification messages from each control-window
item in a dialog window whenever a user clicks an item or enters text in
an entry field.  Most dialog procedures wait for the user to select one
or more dialog-window buttons to signal being finished with the dialog window.
 When the dialog procedure receives one of these messages, it calls the
WinDismissDlg function, as shown in the following code fragment.  The second
argument to WinDismissDlg is the value returned by the WinDlgBox or WinProcessDlg
functions.  Generally, these functions return the identifier of the button
that was pressed.
<P>

<PRE>    MRESULT EXPENTRY SampDialogProc(HWND hwnd,
                                    ULONG ulMessage,
                                    MPARAM mp1,
                                    MPARAM mp2)
    {
        switch (ulMessage) {
            case WM_COMMAND:
                switch (SHORT1FROMMP(mp1)) {
                    case DID_OK:

                       /*
                        * Final dialog-item queries,
                        * dismiss the dialog.
                        */

                       WinDismissDlg(hwnd, DID_OK);
                       return 0;
                }
                break;
        }
        return (WinDefDlgProc(hwnd, ulMessage, mp1, mp2));
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Other dialog-window items send notification messages specific to the type
of control window. Your dialog procedure should respond to notification
messages from any relevant or important dialog items, and pass the messages
that your dialog procedure does not handle to the WinDefDlgProc function
for default processing.  The default dialog procedure is used similarly
to the default frame-window procedure.
<P>
The WM_COMMAND message from the<B> OK</B> button indicates that the user
has selected the<B> OK</B> button and is finished with the dialog window.
 If the dialog window has other controls, such as entry fields or check
boxes, have your dialog procedure query the contents or state of each control
upon<!-- entering slot 1396 --> receipt of a message from the<B> OK</B> button.
 Before dismissing a dialog window, have your dialog procedure collect input
from each dialog-window control before closing the dialog window.
