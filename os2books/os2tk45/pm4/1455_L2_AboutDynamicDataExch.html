<H1>About Dynamic Data Exchange</H1><!-- entering slot 1483 -->
<P>
DDE is different from the clipboard data-transfer component that is also
part of this operating system. The clipboard is almost always used as a
one-time response to a specific action by the user, such as choosing<B> Paste
</B>from a menu. DDE, on the other hand, is often initiated by a user but
typically continues without the user's further involvement. DDE is separate
from and does not use the clipboard.
<P>
DDE always takes place between two applications: a<I> client</I> application
and a<I> server</I> application. The client initiates the exchange by requesting
that the server perform a particular action, such as supply data. The client's
request to the server is called a<I> transaction</I>. If it is able, the
server responds by performing the requested action. The important distinction
between a client and a server is that the client always initiates DDE transactions.

<P>
A server can have many clients simultaneously, and a client can request
data from multiple servers. An application can be both a client and a server
at the same time. For example, one application could receive data from another
application as a client and then act as a server by passing the data to
yet another application.
