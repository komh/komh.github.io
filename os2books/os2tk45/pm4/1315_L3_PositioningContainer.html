<P>
Container items are positioned in the Icon view according to workspace coordinates.

<P>
The<I> workspace</I> is a two-dimensional Cartesian-coordinate system. The
user can see a portion of the workspace in the work area, which is the scrollable
viewing area of the container that is defined by the size of the container
window. The work area is logically scrollable within the workspace.
