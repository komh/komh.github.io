<H1>About Window-Drawing Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 1472 -->
<P>
The functionality of the PM window-drawing functions overlaps that of similar
Graphic Programming Interface (GPI) drawing functions in OS/2.  These window-drawing
functions are less general than the GPI functions and are somewhat easier
to use, but they also offer fewer capabilities than the complete set of
GPI functions.  Programmers requiring optimum functionality should use the
GPI functions.
