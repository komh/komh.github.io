<P>
The target may select the DRM_OS2FILE rendering mechanism when it is not
the native rendering mechanism for an object, as long as the source supports
it. In this case, the target must always request that the source carry out
the rendering operation as described above. The source should render the
data in the requested format to the file specified by the<I> hstrRenderToName
</I>field. If the requested operation is a Move, the source should take
whatever action is necessary to remove its knowledge of the object as long
as no information regarding the object was lost in the transfer.
