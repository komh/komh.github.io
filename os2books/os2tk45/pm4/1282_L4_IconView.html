<H1>Icon View</H1><!-- entering slot 1303 -->
<P>
The Icon view (CV_ICON attribute) displays icon/text pairs or bit-map/text
pairs to represent container items; this is the default view. CV_ICON is
an attribute of the CNRINFO data structure's<I> flWindowAttr</I> field.

<P>
In the Icon view, icon/text pairs and bit-map/text pairs are icons and bit
maps, respectively, with one or more lines of text displayed below each
icon or bit map. Each line can contain one or more text characters, which
are centered below the icon or bit map. The container control does not limit
the number of lines or the number of characters in each line.
<P>
Generally, the icon or bit map contains an image that depicts the type of
container item that it represents. For example, an icon or bit map that
represents a bar chart might contain an image of a bar chart.
<P>
Because the container control does not support both icons and bit maps in
the same view, an application must specify which are used by setting either
the CA_DRAWICON attribute or the CA_DRAWBITMAP attribute in the<I> flWindowAttr
</I>field of the CNRINFO data structure. The default is the CA_DRAWICON
attribute. The size of the icon or bit map can be specified in the<I> slBitmapOrIcon
</I>field of the CNRINFO data structure.
<P>
In the Icon view, container items are positioned according to<I> x-</I> and
<I>y-</I>coordinate positions. These are called<I> workspace coordinates</I>.
You can supply these coordinates for each container item by using the<I> ptlIcon
</I>field of the RECORDCORE data structure.
<P>
If you do not specify<I> x-</I> and<I> y-</I>coordinate positions, the container
control places the icons or bit maps at (0,0). However, your application
can arrange the icons or bit maps either by sending the CM_ARRANGE message
or by setting the CCS_AUTOPOSITION style bit when creating a container.
With both of these methods, the container items are arranged in rows, and
any coordinates specified in the<I> ptlIcon</I> field are ignored. As they
are arranged each<I> ptlIcon</I> is updated with its new location.
<P>
The container items fill the topmost row until the width of the work area
is reached. The items then wrap to form another row immediately below the
filled row. This process is repeated until all the container items are positioned
in rows. Default spacing is implemented according to the guidelines for
the CUA user interface.
<P>
If the CCS_AUTOPOSITION style bit is set and the container is displaying
the Icon view, container items are arranged automatically, without the CM_ARRANGE
message being sent, when:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The window size changes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Container items are inserted, removed, sorted, invalidated,
or filtered<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The font or font size changes<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In all of these cases, container items are arranged the same as when the
CM_ARRANGE message is sent. The CCS_AUTOPOSITION style bit is valid only
when it is used with the Icon view.
<P>
If the CM_ARRANGE message is issued and the container control is not currently
displaying the Icon view, the container items are still arranged logically.
Nothing changes in the current view; the arrangement of the container items
is not visible until the user switches to the Icon view.
