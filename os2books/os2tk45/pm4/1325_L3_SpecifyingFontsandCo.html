<P>
A different font can be specified for each view. The same font is used for
the text within each view. Text color can be configured from the system
control panel. The application can override the system-defined font and
colors by using WinSetPresParam.
<P>
The font and color can be changed for the text in all views. However, font
and color cannot be changed for text in individual columns in the Details
view. Therefore, all text in the details view, including the container title,
columns, and column headings, has the same font and color.
