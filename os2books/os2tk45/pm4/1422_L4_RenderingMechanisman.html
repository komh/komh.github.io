<H1>Rendering Mechanism and Format</H1><!-- entering slot 1448 -->
<P>
The rendering mechanism and format are passed as a string handle in the
DRAGITEM data structure. The string handle must be created using DrgAddStrHandle.
The following figure shows the string handle format:
<PRE>"elem {,elem,elem...}"

</PRE>
where<I> elem</I> is an ordered pair in the form:
<PRE>"&lt;mechanism,format&gt;"
</PRE>

<P>
or a cross product in the form:
<PRE>"(mechanism{,mechanism...}) X (format{,format...})"
</PRE>

<P>
Multiple cross products are permitted in a single rendering mechanism and
format string handle, as are combinations of ordered pairs and cross products.
When cross-product notation is used, the rendering mechanism is the left
operand. When ordered-pair notation is used, the rendering mechanism is
the left element in the ordered pair.
<P>
Several constants are defined for common rendering mechanisms and formats.
For example, the rendering mechanism and format for a:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->C source file might be    "&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,CF_OEMTEXT&gt;"
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Spreadsheet file might be "&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,CF_SYLK&gt;"
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application can extend these by defining its own "&lt;<I>mechanism</I>,<I>format</I>&gt;"
strings and creating string handles for these using DrgAddStrHandle. For
example, if an application understands and can generate an LU 6.2 data stream,
it can define its own rendering format, "DRF_LU62", and use it in direct
manipulation operations. If an application wishes to use its own rendering
mechanisms or formats to communicate with other applications, it should
publish the protocol for the mechanisms, the format of the data streams,
or both.
