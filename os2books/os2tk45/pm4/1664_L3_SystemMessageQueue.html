<H1>System Message Queue</H1><!-- entering slot 1701 -->
<P>
The operating system routes all keystrokes and mouse input to the system
message queue, converting these input events into messages, and posts them,
one at a time, to the proper application-defined message queues.  An application
retrieves messages from its queue and dispatches them to the appropriate
window procedures, which process the messages.
<P>
Mouse and keyboard input events in the system message queue are strictly
ordered so that a new event cannot be processed until all previous events
are fully processed: the system cannot determine the destination window
of an input event until then.  For example, if a user types a command in
one window, clicks the mouse to activate another window, then types a command
in the second window, the destination of the second command depends on how
the application handles the mouse click.  The second command would go to
the second window only if that window became active as a result of the mouse
click.
<P>
It is important for an application to process all messages quickly to avoid
slowing user interaction with the system.  A message must be responded to
immediately in the current thread, but the processing it initiates should
be done asynchronously in another thread that has no windows in the desktop
tree.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system can display multiple windows belonging to several
applications at the same time.  To manage input among these windows, the
system uses the concepts of<I> window activation</I> and<I> keyboard focus</I>.
