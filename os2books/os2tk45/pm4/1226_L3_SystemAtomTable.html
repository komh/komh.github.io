<H1>System Atom Table</H1><!-- entering slot 1246 -->
<P>
The<I> system atom table</I> is available to all applications. When an application
places a string in the system atom table, any application that has the atom
name can obtain the atom by querying the system atom table.
<P>
An application that defines messages, clipboard-data formats, or dynamic
data exchange (DDE) data formats that are intended for use among applications
must place the names of the messages or formats in the system atom table.
It avoids possible conflicts with messages or formats defined by the system
or other applications, and makes the atoms for the messages or formats available
to other applications. Applications should use names that are not likely
to be used by other applications for other purposes.
<P>
Some PM functions enable applications to use atoms in parameters that normally
take pointers to strings. For example, WinRegisterClass takes a pointer
to a string for its<I> pszClassName</I> parameter. WinRegisterClass places
the class name string in the system atom table. Afterward, an application
can query the system atom table to obtain the atom, then use the atom as
the<I> pszClientClass</I> parameter of WinCreateStdWindow. This process
can save space in the data segment of applications that create many windows
of the same private class.  Every atom table has a unique handle. An application
must obtain the handle before performing any atom operations. To obtain
the handle of the system atom table, an application uses WinQuerySystemAtomTable.
The atom-table handle returned by this call is used for all other atom functions.
