<H1>Selection Techniques</H1><!-- entering slot 1332 -->
<P>
Depending on the type of view and the type of selection, a user can select
container items using the following selection techniques:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Marquee selection
<P>
Marquee selection is supported only in the Icon view and is only valid with
the extended and multiple selection types. This selection technique enables
a user to begin selection from an anchor point that is established by moving
the pointer to white space in the container and pressing, but not releasing,
the select button on the pointing device. As the user presses the select
button and drags the pointer, a tracking rectangle is drawn between the
anchor point and the current pointer position. All items whose icons or
bit maps are entirely within the tracking rectangle are dynamically selected.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Swipe selection
<P>
Swipe selection is valid only with the extended and multiple selection types.
The container control implements two techniques for swipe selection: touch
swipe and range swipe.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Touch swipe
<P>
Touch-swipe selection is implemented in the Icon view. With this selection
technique, the pointer must pass over some portion of a container item while
the user is pressing the select button for that item to be selected.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Range swipe
<P>
In views other than the Icon and Tree views, range-swipe selection is available.
With this method, the user presses the select button while moving the pointer.
However, the pointer does not have to pass directly over a container item
for that item to be selected. Aside from pressing the select button and
moving the pointer, the only other requirement for selection is that the
container item must be within a range of items that is being selected. The
range begins at the pointer's position when the user presses the select
button; it ends at the pointer's position when the user releases the select
button.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>First-letter
selection
<P>
For the Icon, Name, Text, and Tree views, first letter selection occurs
when a character key is pressed, and the first container item whose text
begins with that character is displayed with selected-state emphasis. The
same is true for the Details view, except that all the columns for a record
are searched for a matching character before the next record is searched.
The effect of first letter selection on other selected container items depends
on the chosen selection type (single, multiple, or extended).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If more than one container window is open, selecting a container
item in one window has no effect on the selections in any other window.
