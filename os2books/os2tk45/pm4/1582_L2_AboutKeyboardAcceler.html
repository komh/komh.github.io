<H1>About Keyboard Accelerators</H1><!-- entering slot 1617 -->
<P>
Using a keyboard accelerator has the same effect as choosing a menu item.
 While menus provide an easy way to learn an application's command set,
accelerators provide quick access to those commands.
<P>
Without accelerators, a user might generate commands by pressing the Alt
key to access the menu bar, using the Arrow keys to select an item, then
pressing the Enter key to choose the item.  In contrast, accelerators allow
the user to generate commands<I> with a single keystroke</I>.
<P>
Like menu items, accelerators can generate WM_COMMAND, WM_HELP, and WM_SYSCOMMAND
messages.  Although, normally, accelerators are used to generate existing
commands as menu items, they also can send commands that have no menu-item
equivalent.
