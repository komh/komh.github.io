<P>
To put data on the clipboard, an application first calls the WinOpenClipbrd
function to verify that other applications are not trying to retrieve or
set clipboard data.  The WinOpenClipbrd function does not return if another
thread has the clipboard open; it waits until either the clipboard is free
or there is a message in the message queue of the calling thread.  In practice,
the WinOpenClipbrd function waits until the clipboard is available or until
the calling application responds to a message.  If the clipboard cannot
be opened before a message arrives, the application receives the message,
and the WinOpenClipbrd function continues to try to open the clipboard.
 The WinOpenClipbrd function does not return until the clipboard is open.
 However, the application continues to receive messages.
<P>
Once an application successfully opens the clipboard, it must remove any
previously stored data on the clipboard by calling the WinEmptyClipbrd function.
 If the clipboard is not cleared, writing an existing format on the clipboard
replaces the old data in that format with the new data.  Old data in other
formats remains on the clipboard.
<P>
After emptying the clipboard, an application should write its data to the
clipboard in as many standard formats as possible.  For each format, the
application passes the data to the clipboard by calling the WinSetClipbrdData
function, specifying each data format.  The clipboard is not cleared when
a new format is written to it; all new data formats coexist on the clipboard
until it is cleared by the next clipboard user.
<P>
If an application passes NULL as the<I> ulData</I> parameter of the WinSetClipbrdData
function, applications must render the data on request.
<P>
Finally, when an application finishes writing the clipboard data, it must
release the clipboard by calling the WinCloseClipbrd function so that other
applications can use the clipboard.
