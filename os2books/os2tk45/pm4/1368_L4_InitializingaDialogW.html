<H1>Initializing a Dialog Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1393 -->
<P>
Generally, an application defines a dialog template in its resource file
and loads the dialog window by calling the WinLoadDlg function or the WinDlgBox
function (which calls WinLoadDlg).  The dialog window is created as an invisible
window unless the window style WS_VISIBLE is specified in the dialog template.
 A WM_INITDLG message is sent to the dialog procedure before WinLoadDlg
returns.  As each control defined in the template is created, the dialog
procedure might receive various control notifications before the function
returns.  WinLoadDlg returns a handle to the dialog window immediately after
creating a dialog window.
<P>
In general, it is a good idea to define a dialog window as invisible, since
this allows for optimization.  For example, an experienced user might type
ahead rapidly, anticipating the processing of a dialog-window command.  In
such a case, there is no need to display the dialog window, because the
user has finished the interaction before the window can be displayed.  This
is how the WinProcessDlg function works-it does not display a dialog window
while there still are WM_CHAR messages in the input queue; it processes
the WM_CHAR messages before displaying the dialog window.
<P>
As control windows in a dialog window are created from the template, strings
in the template are processed by the WinSubstituteStrings function.  Any
WM_SUBSTITUTESTRING messages are sent to the dialog procedure before WinLoadDlg
returns.
<P>
When child windows of a dialog window are created, WinSubstituteStrings
is used so child windows can make substitutions in their window text.  If
any child-window text string contains the percent sign (%) substitution
character, the length of the text string is limited to 256 characters after
it is returned from the substitution.
