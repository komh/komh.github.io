<P>
Prior to establishing a DDE conversation, the target should determine the
source-supported formats in which it wants to have the object rendered.
It should register this format in the system atom table and use the resulting
atom in the<I> usFormat</I> field of the DDESTRUCT used in the conversation.

<P>
The target should establish the DDE conversation by posting a WM_DDE_REQUEST
message to the window indicated by the<I> hwndItem</I> field in the DRAGITEM
data structure. The target acts as the client, and the source acts as the
server in the conversation.
