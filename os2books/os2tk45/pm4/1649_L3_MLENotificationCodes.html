<H1>MLE Notification Codes</H1><!-- entering slot 1686 -->
<P>
An MLE field control sends WM_CONTROL messages containing notification codes
to its owner whenever certain events occur, for example, when the user or
application tries to insert too much text, or when the user uses the scroll
bars. The owner window uses the notification codes either to carry out custom
operations for the MLE field or to respond to errors.
<P>
The MLE field control sends the MLN_HSCROLL or MLN_VSCROLL notification
codes when the user enables the scroll bars so that the application can
monitor the visible contents of the MLE field. The application also can
monitor the contents of an MLE field by using the MLM_QUERYFIRSTCHAR message,
which specifies the offset of the character in the upper-left corner of
the MLE field. This represents the first MLE character that is visible to
the user. To provide an alternative way of scrolling the contents of an
MLE field, an application can move the character at the specified offset
to the upper-left corner of an MLE field using the MLM_SETFIRSTCHAR message.

<P>
The MLE field control sends an MLN_CHANGE notification code when the user
changes the text in some way. This notification code is especially useful
when the MLE field is in a dialog window, because the dialog procedure can
use this code to determine whether it should process the contents of the
MLE field. If an application does not process MLN_CHANGE notification codes,
it can use the MLM_QUERYCHANGED message to determine whether the user has
made changes to the MLE text. The MLM_SETCHANGED message makes the MLE field
control send an MLN_CHANGE notification code with every event that occurs
in the MLE field, regardless of whether the user has changed anything. This
code also can be used to hide a change made by a user.
