<P>
A window processing DDE requests from another window must process them strictly
in the order in which the requests were received.
<P>
A window does not need to apply this first-in first-out (FIFO) rule between
requests from different windows-that is, it may provide asynchronous support
for multiple processes. For example, a window might have the following requests
in its queue:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Request message from window x<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Request message from window y<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Request message from window x<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The window must process request message 1 before request message 3, but
it does not have to process request message 2 before request message 3.
If y has a lower priority than x, the window follows the order 1, 3, 2.

<P>
If a server is unable to process an incoming request because it is waiting
for an external process, it must post a busy WM_DDE_ACK message to the client,
to prevent deadlock. A busy WM_DDE_ACK message can also be sent if the server
is unable to process an incoming request quickly.
