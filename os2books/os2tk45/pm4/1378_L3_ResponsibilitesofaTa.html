<H1>Responsibilites of a Target Application</H1><!-- entering slot 1404 -->
<P>
The target in a direct manipulation operation is responsible for determining
whether a particular set of objects can be dropped on it, and for providing
the user with visible cues regarding the operation. A target is informed
of the operation through messages sent to it as the pointer, provided by
the source, is dragged across the screen.
<P>
When a set of objects is dropped on the target, the target is responsible
for establishing the appropriate conversations with the source to accomplish
the data transfer. The type of conversation for each object is based on
the rendering mechanism and format of the object being dropped.
<P>
The target application is responsible for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
