<P>
An application uses frame-control flags in WinCreateStdWindow to specify
which frame controls to give to the frame window.  Frame-control flags are
constants that have the FCF_ prefix.
<P>
The frame-window class (WC_FRAME), like other public window classes, provides
many class-specific window styles that applications can use to adapt the
appearance and behavior of a frame window.  To specify the frame-window
styles, an application can use either frame-control flags or the frame-window
style constants, which have the FS_ prefix.  Each style constant has a corresponding
frame-control flag.  Both produce exactly the same styles in a frame window.
 Typically, if an application is creating a frame window that uses frame
controls, the application uses frame-control flags to specify the frame-window
styles-if not, the application uses frame-style constants.  An application
can combine the frame-style constants with the standard window styles when
creating a frame window.
<P>
When an application calls WinCreateStdWindow without setting any frame-control
flags, the function creates a standard window that is invisible and behind
all its sibling windows, has a width and height of 0, and is positioned
at the lower-left corner of its parent window.  After the call to WinCreateStdWindow
returns, the application can use WinSetWindowPos to change the window's
size, coordinates, z-order position, and visibility.
<P>
If an application calls WinCreateStdWindow with the FCF_SHELLPOSITION frame-control
flag, the function creates the window so that it is in front of its sibling
windows and has a standard size and coordinates determined by the system.
