<P>
Three-state check boxes are similar to check boxes, except that they can
be displayed in<I> halftone</I> as well as selected and unselected.  An
application might use the halftone state to indicate that, currently, the
checkbox is not selectable.  A three-state check-box control sends WM_CONTROL
messages and posts WM_COMMAND messages to its owner window.
