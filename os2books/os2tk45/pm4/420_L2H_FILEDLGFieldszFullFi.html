<P>
An array of characters where CCHMAXPATH is a system-defined constant. On
initialization, this field contains the initial fully-qualified path and
file name. On completion, this field contains the selected fully-qualified
path and file name. The simple file name can be replaced with a string filter,
such as *.DAT. When the dialog is invoked, all drive and path information
is stripped from the entry and moved to the corresponding fields in the
dialog.
<P>
When a file name is specified, the Files list box is scrolled to the matching
file name. When there is no exact match, the closest match is used.
<P>
When a string filter is specified, the dialog is initially refreshed using
the results of this filter intersected with the results of<I> pszIType</I>.
After the dialog is initially shown, the string filter remains in the file
name field until a file is selected, or the user overtypes the value.
<P>
When a file is selected,<B> szFullFile</B> is returned to the calling application
and is set to the selected fully-qualified file name.
<P>
When more than one file is selected in a multiple file selection dialog,
only the topmost selected file name is returned in this field.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
