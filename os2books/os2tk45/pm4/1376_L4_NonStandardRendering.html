<H1>Non-Standard Rendering Mechanisms</H1><!-- entering slot 1402 -->
<P>
Some standard rendering mechanisms are already defined, but the system lets
the set of rendering mechanisms be expanded, allowing for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Additional standard rendering mechanisms to be defined
in the future<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Application definition of private or nonstandard rendering
mechanisms<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application can elect to support some, all, or none of the standard rendering
mechanisms defined by the system. Applications that do not support any of
the standard rendering mechanisms are not precluded from using direct manipulation.
However, support of the standard rendering mechanisms and formats increases
the chances of a successful data transfer between applications.
<P>
An application that supports a particular rendering mechanism, whether or
not it is a rendering mechanism defined by the system, must follow a specific
set of guidelines defined by that rendering mechanism, including conversation-initiation
procedures and naming conventions.
