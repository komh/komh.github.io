The container control supports the following selection types:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Single selection
<P>
Single selection enables a user to select only one container item at a time.
This is the default selection type for all views and is the only selection
type supported for the Tree view.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Extended selection
<P>
Extended selection enables a user to select one or more container items,
in any combination. The CUA-defined keyboard augmentation keys are implemented
for extended selection. When used with a pointing device, these keys enable
a user to select discontiguous sets of container items. Extended selection
is valid for all views except the Tree view.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multiple selection
<P>
Multiple selection enables a user to select none, some, or all of the container
items. Multiple selection is valid for all views except the Tree view.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Only one of these selection types can be used for each container. The selection
type for a container is defined when the container is created.
