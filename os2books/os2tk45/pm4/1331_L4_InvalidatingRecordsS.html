<H1>Invalidating Records Shared by Multiple Containers</H1><!-- entering slot 1353 -->
<P>
When a record is invalidated by an application, the<I> flRecordAttr</I> and
<I>ptlIcon</I> fields are saved internally, just as when a record is inserted.
The CM_QUERYRECORDINFO message is used to acquire the current data for each
record that is being invalidated. After querying the current data, the data
can be changed before invalidating its record.
