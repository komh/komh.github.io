<H1>Creating an Entry Field in a Dialog Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1526 -->
<P>
A dialog window usually serves as the parent and owner of an entry field.
 The dialog window often includes a button that indicates whether the user
wants to carry out an operation.  When the user selects the button, the
application queries the contents of the entry field and proceeds with the
operation.
<P>
The definition of an entry field in an application's resource-definition
file sets the initial text, window identifier, size, position, and style
of the entry field.  The following example shows how to define an entry
field as part of a dialog template:
<PRE>
    DLGTEMPLATE IDD_SAMPLE
    BEGIN
        DIALOG "Sample Dialog", ID_DLG, 7, 7, 253, 145, FS_DLGBORDER,0
        BEGIN
            DEFPUSHBUTTON "~OK", DID_OK, 8, 151, 50, 23, WS_GROUP
            ENTRYFIELD "Here is some text", ID_ENTFLD, 42, 46, 68, 15,
                ES_MARGIN | ES_AUTOSCROLL
        END
    END

</PRE>
