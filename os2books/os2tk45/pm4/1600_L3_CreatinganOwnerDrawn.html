<H1>Creating an Owner-Drawn List Item</H1><!-- entering slot 1635 -->
<P>
To draw its own list items, an application must create a list that has the
style LS_OWNERDRAW:  the owner window of the list box must respond to the
WM_MEASUREITEM and WM_DRAWITEM messages.
<P>
When the owner window receives a WM_MEASUREITEM message, it must return
the height of the list item.  All items in a list must have the same height
(greater than or equal to 1).  The WM_MEASUREITEM message is sent when the
list box is created, and every time an item is added.  You can change the
item height by sending an LM_SETITEMHEIGHT message to the list-box window.
The maximum width of a list box created with the LM_HORZSCROLL style can
be set using an LM_SETITEMWIDTH message.
<P>
The owner window receives a WM_DRAWITEM message whenever an item in an owner-drawn
list should be drawn or highlighted.  Although it is quite common for an
owner-drawn list to draw items, it is less common to override the system-default
method of highlighting.  (This method inverts the rectangle that contains
the item.)  Do not create your own highlighting unless, for some reason,
the system-default method is unacceptable to you.
<P>
The WM_DRAWITEM message contains a pointer to an OWNERITEM data structure.
 The OWNERITEM structure contains the window identifier for the list box,
a presentation-space handle, a bounding rectangle for the item, the position
index for the item, and the application-defined item handle.  This structure
also contains two fields that determine whether a message draws, highlights,
or removes the highlighting from an item.  The OWNERITEM structure has the
following form:
<PRE>    typedef struct _OWNERITEM { /* oi */
        HWND    hwnd;
        HPS     hps;
        ULONG   fsState;
        ULONG   fsAttribute;
        ULONG   fsStateOld;
        ULONG   fsAttributeOld;
        RECTL   rclItem;
        LONG    idItem;
        ULONG   hItem;
    } OWNERITEM;

</PRE>
When the item must be drawn, the owner window receives a WM_DRAWITEM message
with the<I> fsState</I> field set differently from the<I> fsStateOld</I> field.
 If the owner window draws the item in response to this message, it returns
TRUE, telling the system not to draw the item.  If the owner window returns
FALSE, the system draws the item, using the default list-item drawing method.

<P>
You can get the text of a list item by sending an LM_QUERYITEMTEXT message
to the list-box window.  You should draw the item using the<I> hps</I> and
<I>rclItem</I> arguments provided in the OWNERITEM structure.
<P>
If the item being drawn is currently selected, the<I> fsState</I> and<I> fsStateOld
</I>fields are both TRUE; they both will be FALSE if the item is not currently
selected.  The window receiving a WM_DRAWITEM message can use this information
to highlight the selected item at the same time it draws the item.  If the
owner window highlights the item, it must leave the<I> fsState</I> and<I> fsStateOld
</I>fields equal to each other.  If the system provides default highlighting
for the item (by inverting the item rectangle), the owner window must set
the<I> fsState</I> field to<I> 1</I> and the<I> fsStateOld</I> field to
<I>0</I> before returning from the WM_DRAWITEM message.
<P>
The owner window also receives a WM_DRAWITEM message when the highlight
state of a list item changes.  For example, when a user clicks an item,
the highlighting must be removed from the currently selected item, and the
new selection must be highlighted.  If these items are owner-drawn, the
owner window receives one WM_DRAWITEM message for each unhighlighted item
and one message for the newly highlighted item.  To highlight an item, the
<I>fsState</I> field must equal TRUE, and the<I> fsStateOld</I> field must
equal FALSE.  In this case, the application should highlight the item and
return the<I> fsState</I> and<I> fsStateOld</I> fields equal to FALSE, which
tells the system not to highlight the item.  The application also can return
the<I> fsState</I> and<I> fsStateOld</I> fields with two different (unequal)
values and the list box will highlight the item (the default action).
<P>
To remove highlighting from an item, the<I> fsState</I> field must equal
FALSE and the<I> fsStateOld</I> field must equal TRUE.  In this case, the
application removes the highlighting and returns both the<I> fsState</I> and
the<I> fsStateOld</I> fields equal to FALSE.  This tells the system not
to attempt to remove the highlighting.  The application also can return
the<I> fsState</I> and<I> fsStateOld</I> fields with two different (unequal)
values, and the list box will remove the highlighting (the default response).
The following code fragment shows these selection processes:
<PRE>    OWNERITEM *poi;

    case WM_DRAWITEM:

        /* Convert mp2 into an OWNERITEM structure pointer.                */
        poi = (POWNERITEM) PVOIDFROMMP(mp2);

        /* Test to see if this is drawing or highlighting/unhighlighting.  */
        if (poi-&gt;fsState != poi-&gt;fsStateOld) {

            /* This is either highlighting or unhighlighting.              */
            if (poi-&gt;fsState) {
                .
                . /* Highlight the item.                                   */
                .
            }
            else {
                .
                . /* Remove the highlighting.                              */
                .
            }

            /* Set fsState = fsStateOld to tell system you did it.         */
            poi-&gt;fsState = poi-&gt;fsStateOld = 0;

            return TRUE;  /* Tells list box you did the highlighting.      */

        }
        else {
            .
            . /* Draw the item.                                            */
            .
            if (poi-&gt;fsState) {   /* Checks to see if item is selected     */
                .
                . /* Highlight the item.                                   */
                .
                /* Set fsState = fsStateOld to tell system you did it.     */
           }
           return TRUE;  /* Tells list box you did the drawing.            */
        }
</PRE>
