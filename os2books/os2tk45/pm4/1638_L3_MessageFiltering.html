<H1>Message Filtering</H1><!-- entering slot 1675 -->
<P>
An application can choose specific messages to retrieve from the message
queue (and ignore other messages) by specifying a message filter with the
WinGetMsg or WinPeekMsg functions.  The message filter is a range of message
identifiers (specified by a first and last identifier), a window handle,
or both.  The WinGetMsg and WinPeekMsg functions use the<I> message filter
</I>to select the messages to retrieve from the queue.  Message filtering
is useful if an application needs to search ahead in the message queue for
messages that have a lower priority or that arrived in the queue later than
other less important messages.
<P>
Any application that filters messages must ensure that a message satisfying
the message filter can be posted.  For example, filtering for a WM_CHAR
message in a window that does not receive keyboard input prevents the WinGetMsg
function from returning.  Some messages, such as WM_COMMAND, are generated
from other messages; filtering for them also can prevent WinGetMsg from
returning.
<P>
To filter for mouse, button, and DDE messages, an application can use the
following constants:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
WM_MOUSEFIRST and WM_MOUSELAST<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
WM_BUTTONCLICKFIRST and WM_BUTTONCLICKLAST<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
WM_DDE_FIRST and WM_DDE_LAST.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
