<H1>Message Queues</H1><!-- entering slot 1665 -->
<P>
Every PM application must have a<I> message queue</I>. A message queue is
the only means an application has to receive input from the keyboard or
mouse. <I> Only applications that create message queues can create windows</I>.

<P>
An application creates a message queue by using the WinCreateMsgQueue function.
 This function returns a handle that the application can use to access the
message queue.  After an application creates a message queue, the system
posts messages intended for windows in the application to that queue.  The
application can retrieve queue messages by specifying the message-queue
handle in the WinGetMsg function. It also can examine messages, without
retrieving them, by using the WinPeekMsg function. When an application no
longer needs the message queue, it can destroy the queue by using the WinDestroyMsgQueue
function.
<P>
One message queue serves all the windows in a thread. This means a queue
can hold messages for several windows. A message specifies the handle of
the window to which it belongs so the application can forward a message
easily to the appropriate window. The message loop recognizes a NULL window
handle and the message is processed within the message loop rather than
passed to WinDispatchMessage. See the following figure for an example of
an input-message processing loop.
<P>
An application that has more than one thread can create more than one message
queue.  The system allows one message queue for each thread.  A message
queue created by a thread belongs to that thread and has no connection to
other queues in the application.  When an application creates a window in
a given thread, the system associates the window with the message queue
in that thread.  The system then posts all subsequent messages intended
for that window to that queue.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The recommended way to structure PM applications is to have
at least two threads and two message queues.  The first thread and message
queue control all the user-interface windows, and the second thread and
message queue control all the object windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Several windows can use one message queue; it is important that the message
queue be large enough to hold all messages that possibly can be posted to
it.  An application can set the size of the message queue when it creates
the queue by specifying the maximum number of messages the queue can hold.
 The default maximum number of messages is 10.
<P>
To minimize queue size, several types of posted messages are not actually
stored in a message queue.  Instead, the operating system keeps a record
in the queue of the message being posted and combines any information contained
in the message with information from previous messages.  Timer, semaphore,
and paint messages are handled this way.  For example, if more than one
WM_PAINT message is posted, the operating system combines the<I> update
regions</I> for each into a single update region.  Although there is no
actual WM_PAINT message in the queue, the operating system constructs one
WM_PAINT message with the single update region when an application uses
the WinGetMsg function.
<P>
The operating system handles mouse and keyboard input messages differently
from the way it handles other types of messages.  The operating system receives
all keyboard and mouse events, such as keystrokes and mouse movements, into
the system message queue.  The operating system converts these events into
messages and posts them, one at a time, to the appropriate application message
queue.  The application retrieves the messages from its queue and dispatches
them to the appropriate window, which processes the messages.
<P>
The operating system message queue usually is large enough to hold all input
messages, even if the user types or moves the mouse very quickly.  If the
operating system message queue does run out of space, the system<I> ignores
</I>the most recent keyboard input (usually by beeping to indicate the input
is ignored) and collects mouse motions into a WM_MOUSEMOVE message.
<P>
Every message queue has a corresponding MQINFO data structure that specifies
the identifiers of the process and thread that own the message queue and
gives a count of the maximum number of messages the queue can receive.  An
application can retrieve the structure by using the WinQueryQueueInfo function.

<P>
A message queue also has a current status that indicates the types of messages
currently in the queue.  An application can retrieve the queue status by
using the WinQueryQueueStatus function.  An application also can use the
WinPeekMsg function to examine the contents of a message queue.  WinPeekMsg
checks for a specific message or range of messages in the queue and gives
the application the option of removing messages from the queue.  An application
<I>can</I> call the WinQueryQueueStatus function to determine the contents
of the queue before calling the WinPeekMsg or WinGetMsg function to remove
a message from the queue.
