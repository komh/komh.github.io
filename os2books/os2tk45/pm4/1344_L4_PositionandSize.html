<P>
An application can set the position (in window coordinates) of an existing
cursor by calling WinCreateCursor, specifying the CURSOR_SETPOS flag.  The
cursor width is usually 0 (nominal border width is used) for text-insertion
cursors.  This is preferable to a value of 1, since such a fine width is
almost invisible on a high-resolution monitor.  The cursor width also can
be related to the window size-for example, when a button control uses a
dotted-line cursor around the button text to indicate focus.  To change
the cursor size, the application must destroy the current cursor and create
a new one of the desired size.
