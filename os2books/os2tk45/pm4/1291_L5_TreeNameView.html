<BR>
Container items in the Tree name view (CV_TREE | CV_NAME) are displayed
as either icon/text pairs or bit-map/text pairs. Similar to the Tree icon
view, the items are drawn as icons or bit maps with one or more lines of
text displayed to the right of each icon or bit map. The container control
does not limit the number of lines or the number of characters in each line
of text.
<P>
Unlike the Tree icon view, however, separate Collapsed and Expanded icons/bit
maps are not used. Instead, if an item is a parent, the icon or bit map
that represents that item contains the same type of visible indication that
is placed in a separate icon/bit map in the Tree icon view to show that
an item can be collapsed or expanded. In this way, the icon or bit map that
represents the parent item can serve a dual purpose and thus preserve space
on the screen, an important consideration if the text strings used to describe
items become too long.
<P>
The container control does not provide default icons or bit maps for the
Tree name view. To display your own Collapsed and Expanded icons or bit
maps, specify their handles using the<I> hptrCollapsed</I> and<I> hptrExpanded
</I>fields of the TREEITEMDESC data structure for icons, and the<I> hbmCollapsed
</I>and<I> hbmExpanded</I> fields for bit maps. Also, you can use the<I> slBitmapOrIcon
</I>field of the CNRINFO data structure to specify the size, in pels, of
these Collapsed and Expanded icons and bit maps.
