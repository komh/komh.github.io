<H1>HK_PLIST_ENTRY - Program List Call Hook</H1><!-- entering slot 1597 -->
<P>
The<I> program list call hook</I> is called every time a program-list call
or initialization file call is invoked by an application.  It is called
before the call is run.
<P>
This hook, together with its counterpart, ProgramListExitHook, lets applications
or system components do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Implement the initialization file and program
list partially, while retaining the existing implementation. For example,
read-only requests could be satisfied from memory, rather than from disk.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Redirect initialization-file operations on a
particular group to an alternative (opened) profile. For example, in a multiple-user
environment, a LAN program might choose to redirect profile groups that
are hardware-dependent, rather than user-dependent, to the system-initialization
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The following code shows the syntax for a program list call hook function:

<PRE>BOOL EXPENTRY ProgramListEntryHook(HAB hab,                                   PPRFHOOKPARMS pProfileHookParams,
                                   PBOOL fNoExecute);
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> hab</I> parameter is the anchor block handle.
<P>
The<I> pProfileHookParams</I> is the profile hook parameters. These identify
the call and give its parameters and return code.
<P>
The<I> fNoExecute</I>parameter is the suppress indicator and is either TRUE
or FALSE. If set to TRUE by any hook procedure, no further processing of
the call is done. If set to FALSE by all hook procedures, the call is processed
normally.
<P>
This function returns either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, the next hook in the
chain is not called. If FALSE, the next hook in the chain is called.
