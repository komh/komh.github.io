<P>
A<I> radio button</I> is a window with text displayed to the right of a
small circular indicator.  Each time the user selects a radio button, that
button's state toggles between<I> selected</I> and<I> unselected</I>.  This
state remains until the next time the user selects the button.  An application
typically uses radio buttons in groups.
<P>
Within a group, usually one button is selected by default, and the user
can move the selection to another button by using the cursor keys; however,
only one button can be selected at a time.  Radio buttons are appropriate
if an<I> exclusive</I> choice is required from a fixed list of related options.
 For example, applications often use radio buttons to allow the user to
select the screen foreground and background colors. A radio-button control
sends WM_CONTROL messages to its owner window.
