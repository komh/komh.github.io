<H1>Allocating Memory for Container Records</H1><!-- entering slot 1318 -->
<P>
Your application must allocate memory for a container record by using the
CM_ALLOCRECORD message, which also enables you to allocate memory for additional
application data.
<P>
The maximum number of records is limited by the amount of memory in the
user's computer. The container control does not limit the number of records
that a container can have.
<P>
The following sample code shows how to allocate memory for records that
populate the container. A pointer to the record is returned.
<PRE>    HWND            hIcon;
    PRECORDCORE     Address, FirstRec;
    RECORDINSERT    recsIn;
    ULONG           x;

/**********************************************************************/
/*  Allocate MAXFRIENDS records all at once -                         */
/*  CM_ALLOCRECORD returns them in a linked list.                     */
/**********************************************************************/
    Address = (PRECORDCORE)WinSendMsg(hWnd,
                                      CM_ALLOCRECORD,
                                      0,
                                      MPFROMLONG(MAXFRIENDS));

</PRE>

<P>
Your application can use the CM_ALLOCRECORD message to allocate memory for
one or more container records. The application can request<I> n</I> container
records with an<B><I> n</B></I><I>Records</I> parameter. If<B><I> n</B></I> is
one, a pointer to that record is returned. If<B><I> n</B></I> is greater
than one, a pointer to the first record in a linked list of<B><I> n</B></I> records
is returned.
