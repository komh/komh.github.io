<H1>About Menus</H1><!-- entering slot 1638 -->
<P>
A menu always is owned by another window, usually a frame window.  When
a user makes a choice from a menu, the menu posts a message containing the
unique identifier for the menu item to its owner by way of the owner window's
window procedure.
<P>
An application typically defines its menus using Resource Compiler, and
then associates the menus with a frame window when the frame window is created.
 Applications also can create menus by filling in menu-template data structures
and creating windows with the WC_MENU class.  Either way, applications can
add, delete, or change menu items dynamically by issuing messages to menu
windows.
