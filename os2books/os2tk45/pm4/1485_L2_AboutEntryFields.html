<H1>About Entry Fields</H1><!-- entering slot 1518 -->
<P>
An entry field provides the text-editing capabilities of a simple text editor
and is useful whenever an application requires a short line of text from
the user.
<P>
If the application requires more sophisticated text-editing capabilities
and multiple lines of text from the user, the application can use a multiple-line
entry (MLE) field. See<I><I> Presentation Manager Programming Guide - Advanced
Topics</I> for more information about MLE controls.
<P>
Both the user and the application can edit text in an entry field.  Applications
typically use entry fields in dialog windows, although they can be used
in non-dialog windows as well.
<P>
An application creates an entry field by specifying either the WC_ENTRYFIELD
window class in the WinCreateWindow function or the ENTRYFIELD statement
in a resource-definition file.
