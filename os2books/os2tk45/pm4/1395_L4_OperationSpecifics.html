<H1>Operation Specifics</H1><!-- entering slot 1421 -->
<P>
Regardless of the operation being performed, the target must fill in the
<I>hstrRenderToName</I> field in the DRAGTRANSFER data structure before
sending a DM_RENDER message. This is the fully qualified drive, path, and
file name of the file that will contain the data when the rendering operation
is complete. When the source has completed the operation, it must post a
DM_RENDERCOMPLETE message to the target. The target then must complete the
direct manipulation operation for that object by posting a DM_ENDCONVERSATION
message to the source. Once the conversations for all of the objects involved
in the drop are complete, the target can delete the string handles and free
the DRAGINFO data structure.
