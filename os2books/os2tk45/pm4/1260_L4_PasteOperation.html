<P>
To retrieve data from the clipboard, an application first must call the
WinOpenClipbrd function to verify that no other applications are trying
to retrieve or set the clipboard data.
<P>
Once an application successfully opens the clipboard, it calls the WinQueryClipbrdData
function, specifying a preferred format.  If that format is not available
(indicated by a NULL return from the WinQueryClipbrdData function) the application
should continue to call WinQueryClipbrdData for other possible formats until
it either receives the data or runs out of format choices.
<P>
If the clipboard contains one of the requested formats, the WinQueryClipbrdData
function returns a 32-bit integer, the meaning of which depends on the particular
format.  For text data, the return value is a pointer to a shareable memory
object containing the text.  For bit map data, the return value is a bit
map handle.  For metafile data, the return value is a metafile handle.
<P>
It is important that an application use the WinCloseClipbrd function to
close the clipboard as soon as possible so that other applications can access
it.
