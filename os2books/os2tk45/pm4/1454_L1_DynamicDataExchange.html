The Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol uses messages to communicate between
applications that share data and uses shared memory as the means of exchanging
data between applications. Applications can use DDE for one-time data transfers
and for ongoing exchanges in which the applications send updates to each
other as new data becomes available. This chapter explains how to use DDE
in PM applications.
