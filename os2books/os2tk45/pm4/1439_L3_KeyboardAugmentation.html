<P>
A direct manipulation operation begins in a<I> default state</I>, which
means that, when the user drops objects on a target, the target is informed
that it should perform its default operation. The target is responsible
for defining its default operation. For a container window, the default
should be a Move operation, if it is supported. The default for a device,
such as a printer, should be a Copy operation.
<P>
As the user drags the object, the default operation can be overridden by
pressing and holding one of the following augmentation keys:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Ctrl<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> Changes the operation to a Copy<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Shift
<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL>Changes the operation to a Move<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Ctrl+Shift
<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL>Changes the operation to a Link.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The last key pressed and held at the time of the drop determines the operation
to be performed. The target can determine the defined augmentation key that
was pressed at the time of the drop by inspecting the<I> usOperation</I> field
of the DRAGINFO data structure.
<P>
A target can define additional augmentation keys for its own use. In this
case,<I> usOperation</I> would indicate that the operation is unknown, and
the target needs to use WinGetKeyState to determine the actual augmentation
key that was used.
<P>
As the user presses augmentation keys, the pointer currently being displayed
is modified to provide the user with a visible cue as to the type of operation
being performed.
