<H1>Determining the Active Status of a Frame Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1717 -->
<P>
The activated state of a window is a frame-window characteristic.  The system
does not provide an easy way to determine whether a client window is part
of the active frame window.  That is, the window handle returned by the
WinQueryActiveWindow function identifies the active frame window rather
than the client window owned by the frame window.
<P>
Following are two methods for determining the activated state of a frame
window that owns a particular client window:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call WinQueryActiveWindow and compare the window handle
it returns with the handle of the frame window that contains the client
window, as shown in the following code fragment:
<P>

<PRE>    HWND hwndClient;
    BOOL fActivated;

    fActivated = (WinQueryWindow(hwndClient, QW_PARENT) ==
                  WinQueryActiveWindow(HWND_DESKTOP));

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Each time the frame window is activated, the client
window receives a WM_ACTIVATE message with the low word of the<I> mp2</I> equal
to TRUE.  When the frame window is deactivated, the client window receives
a WM_ACTIVATE message with a FALSE activation indicator.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
