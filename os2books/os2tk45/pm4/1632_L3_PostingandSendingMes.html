<H1>Posting and Sending Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 1669 -->
<P>
Any application can post and send messages.  Like the operating system,
an application<I> posts</I> a message by copying it to a message queue.
 It<I> sends</I> a message by passing the message data as arguments to a
window procedure.  To post and send messages, an application uses the WinPostMsg
and WinSendMsg functions.
<P>
An application posts a message to notify a specific window to perform a
task.  The WinPostMsg function creates a QMSG structure for the message
and copies the message to the message queue corresponding to the given window.
 The application's message loop eventually retrieves the message and dispatches
it to the appropriate window procedure.  For example, one message commonly
posted is WM_QUIT.  This message terminates the application by terminating
the message loop.
<P>
An application sends a message to cause a specific window procedure to carry
out a task immediately.  The WinSendMsg function passes the message to the
window procedure corresponding to the given window.  The function waits
until the window procedure completes processing and then returns the message
result.  Parent and child windows often communicate by sending messages
to each other.  For example, a parent window that has an entry-field control
as its child window can set the text of the control by sending a message
to the child window.  The control can notify the parent window of changes
to the text (carried out by the user) by sending messages back to the parent
window.
<P>
Occasionally, an application might need to send or post a message to all
windows in the system.  For example, if the application changes a system
value, it must notify all windows about the change by sending a WM_SYSVALUECHANGED
message.  An application can send or post messages to any number of windows
by using the WinBroadcastMsg function.  The options in WinBroadcastMsg determine
whether the message is sent or posted and specify the windows that will
receive the message.
<P>
Any thread in the application can post a message to a message queue, even
if the thread has no message queue of its own.  However, only a thread that
has a message queue can send a message.  Sending a message between threads
is relatively uncommon.  For one reason, sending a message is costly in
terms of system performance.  If an application posts a message between
threads, it is likely to be a semaphore message, which permits window procedures
to manage a shared resource jointly.
<P>
An application can post a message without specifying a window.  If the application
supplies a NULL window handle when it calls the WinPostMsg function, the
function posts the message to the queue associated with the current thread.
 The application must process the message in the message loop.  This is
one way to create a message that applies to the entire application instead
of to a specific window.
<P>
A window procedure can determine whether it is processing a message sent
by another thread by using the WinInSendMsg function.  This is useful when
message processing depends on the origin of the message.
<P>
A common programming error is to assume that the WinPostMsg function always
succeeds.  It fails when the message queue is full.  An application should
check the return value of the WinPostMsg function to see whether the message
was posted.  In general, if an application intends to post many messages
to the queue, it should set the message queue to an appropriate size when
it creates the queue.  The default message-queue size is 10 messages.
