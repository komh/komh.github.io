<H1>Sharing Records among Multiple Containers</H1><!-- entering slot 1352 -->
<P>
The container control enables the application to share records that are
allocated among multiple containers in the same process. That is, records
can be allocated once and then inserted into many containers in the same
process. Only one copy of each record is in memory, but the container provides
the flexibility for the records to appear as though they are independent
of one another.
<P>
When a record is inserted into the container, the<I> flRecordAttr</I> and
<I>ptlIcon</I> fields of the record structure are saved internally. The
values in these fields cause the record attributes for all views and the
icon position for the Icon view to be associated with the specific container
into which the record is inserted. If the same record is inserted into multiple
containers, the attributes and icon location of each record are maintained
separately. The application uses the CM_QUERYRECORDINFO message to retrieve
the current values of these two fields for a particular record in a specific
container.
