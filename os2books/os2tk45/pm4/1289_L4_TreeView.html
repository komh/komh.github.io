<H1>Tree View</H1><!-- entering slot 1310 -->
<P>
The Tree view (CV_TREE attribute) displays container items arranged hierarchically.
CV_TREE is an attribute of the CNRINFO data structure's<I> flWindowAttr
</I>field.
<P>
The leftmost items displayed in the Tree view are at the<I> root level</I> and
are the same items displayed in all the other container views. Items that
contain other items are called<I> parent items</I>. The items that a parent
item contains are called<I> child items</I> and can be displayed only in
the Tree view. Child items that contain other items serve a dual role: they
are the children of their parent item, but they are parent items as well,
with children of their own. For example, a parent item might be a book that
contains individual child items for its chapters or a folder that contains
several reports. The chapters or reports, in turn, could be parent items
that contain their own children, such as the major sections of a chapter
or report.
<P>
If the child items of a parent item are not displayed, the parent item can
be<I> Expanded</I> to display them as a new branch in the Tree view. Once
a parent item has been expanded, it can be<I> Collapsed</I> to remove its
child items from the display.
<P>
You can use the<I> cxTreeIndent</I> and<I> cxTreeLine</I> fields of the
CNRINFO data structure to specify the number of pels that a new branch is
to be indented horizontally, and the width of the lines that are used to
connect branches of the tree. These lines are displayed only if the CA_TREELINE
attribute is specified in the<I> flWindowAttr</I> field.
<P>
The Tree view has three different types: Tree icon view, Tree text view,
and Tree name view. If CV_TREE is specified, the Tree icon view is the default
view. If neither CV_ICON, CV_TEXT, or CV_NAME are specified, CV_ICON is
assumed.
