<H1>About Dialog Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 1375 -->
<P>
A dialog window is a temporary window that contains one or more control
windows and, typically, is used to display messages to and gather input
from the user.  An application usually destroys a dialog window immediately
after using it.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system contains many functions and messages that help
manage the control windows that make up a dialog window, thereby easing
the burden of maintaining complex input and output systems.
