<H1>Shared-Memory Object</H1><!-- entering slot 1490 -->
<P>
After initiating a conversation, the client interacts with the server by
issuing transactions. A<I> transaction</I> is a client's request that the
server perform a particular action.
<P>
To issue a transaction, the client allocates a shared-memory object, writes
data about its request to the object using a DDESTRUCT data structure, then
calls WinDdePostMsg to post a transaction message to the server. The transaction
 message contains the client-window handle and a pointer to the shared-memory
object. When the server receives the message, it uses the pointer to access
the shared-memory object.
<P>
The server responds by allocating a shared-memory object, writing its response
to the object using a DDESTRUCT data structure, then calling WinDdePostMsg
to post a response message to the client. The response message contains
the server-window handle and a pointer to the shared-memory object.
<P>
A DDESTRUCT data structure occupies the first part of the memory object.
Next comes the item-name string, followed by the actual data being exchanged.
The offset fields of the DDESTRUCT data structure must be set to point to
the name string and the beginning of the data. The<I> cbData</I> field also
must be set to indicate the number of bytes of data.
<P>
The sender of a DDE transaction message must allocate a shared-memory object
using DosAllocSharedMem, then call DosGiveSharedMem to share the object
with the receiving application. To share an object, the sender must know
the process identifier of the recipient. The process identifier can be obtained
by calling WinQueryWindowProcess for the recipient's window handle. WinDdePostMsg
also gives the memory object.
<P>
The sender should not try to access the object after sending it to the recipient
in a DDE message. After posting a transaction message, WinDdePostMsg automatically
frees the shared-memory object from the sender's virtual address space.
An application need not call DosFreeMem for this purpose. However, the recipient
must call DosFreeMem when it is finished using the object.
