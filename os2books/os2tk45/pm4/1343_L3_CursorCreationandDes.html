<H1>Cursor Creation and Destruction</H1><!-- entering slot 1368 -->
<P>
The system can use only one cursor at a time, so windows must create and
destroy cursors as each windows gains and loses the keyboard focus.  If
an application attempts to use more than one cursor at a time, the results
can be unpredictable and might affect other applications.
<P>
An application creates a cursor by calling WinCreateCursor.  Generally,
this is done when a window gains the keyboard focus.  The application specifies
the window in which to display the cursor, whether it be the desktop window,
an application window, or a control window.  An application destroys a cursor
by calling WinDestroyCursor- when the specified window loses the keyboard
focus, for example.
