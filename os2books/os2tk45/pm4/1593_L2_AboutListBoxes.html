<H1>About List Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 1628 -->
<P>
An application uses a list box when it requires a list of selectable fields
that is too large for the display area or a list of choices that can change
dynamically.  Each list item contains a text string and a handle.  Usually,
the text string is displayed in the list-box window; but the handle is available
to the application to reference other data associated with each of the items
in the list.
<P>
A list box always is owned by another window that receives messages from
the list box when events occur, such as when a user selects an item from
the list box.  Typically, the owner is a dialog window (as shown in the
following figure,) or the client window of an application frame window.
 The client- or dialog-window procedure defined by the application responds
to messages sent from the list box.
<P>
A list box always contains a scroll bar for use when the list box contains
more items than can be displayed in the list-box window. The list box responds
to mouse clicks in the scroll bar by scrolling the list; otherwise, the
scroll bar is disabled.
<P>
The maximum number of items permitted in a list box is 32767.
