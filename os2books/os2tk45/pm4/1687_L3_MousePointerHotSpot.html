<H1>Mouse-Pointer Hot Spot</H1><!-- entering slot 1724 -->
<P>
Each mouse pointer has its own<I> hot spot</I>, which is the point that
represents the exact location of the mouse pointer. This location is defined
as an<I> x</I> and<I> y</I> offset from the lower-left corner of the mouse-pointer
bit map. For the arrow-shaped pointer, the hot spot is at the tip of the
arrow. For the I-beam pointer, the hot spot is at the middle of the vertical
line.
