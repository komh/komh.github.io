<H1>Native Mechanism Actions</H1><!-- entering slot 1440 -->
<P>
When both a source and target application store the data in the same native
mechanism, a transform is not required. Instead, the native Move and Copy
actions for that mechanism can be performed by the target. An application
must completely define the proper procedure for performing that action.
In the case of files, the native Move action is defined as a DosMove or
DosCopy/DosDelete. The native Copy action is DosCopy. An application need
not support all of the basic actions; it can choose to define additional
native mechanism actions, indicated by the DO_UNKNOWN action in the DRAGINFO
data structure.
