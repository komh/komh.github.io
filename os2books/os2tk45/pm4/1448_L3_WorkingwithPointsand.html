<P>
The operating system includes functions for manipulating rectangles, many
of which change the rectangle coordinates.  Other functions draw in a presentation
space, using a rectangle to position the drawing operation.
<P>
The rest of the rectangle functions are mathematical and do not draw.  They
are used to manipulate and combine rectangles to produce new rectangles
that you then can use in drawing operations.
