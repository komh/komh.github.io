<H1>Responding to a User Selection in a List Box</H1><!-- entering slot 1633 -->
<P>
When a user chooses an item in a list, the primary notification an application
receives is a WM_CONTROL message, with the LN_ENTER control code sent to
the owner window of the list.  Within the window procedure for the owner
window, the application responds to the LN_ENTER control code by querying
the list box for the current selection (or selections, in the case of an
LS_MULTIPLESEL or LS_EXTENDEDSEL list box).
<P>
The LN_ENTER control code notifies the application that the user has selected
a list item.  A WM_CONTROL message with an LN_SELECT control code is sent
to the list-box owner whenever a selection in a list changes, such as when
a user moves the mouse pointer up and down a list while pressing the mouse
button.  In this case, items are selected but not yet<I> chosen</I>.  An
application can ignore LN_SELECT control codes when the selection changes,
responding only when the item is actually chosen.  Or an application can
use LN_SELECT to display context-dependent information that changes rapidly
with each selection made by the user.
