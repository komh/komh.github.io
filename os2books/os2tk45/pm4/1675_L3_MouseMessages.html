<H1>Mouse Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 1712 -->
<P>
Mouse messages occur when a user presses or releases one of the mouse buttons
(a click) and when the mouse moves.  All mouse messages contain the<I> x
</I>and<I> y</I> coordinates of the mouse-pointer<I> hot spot</I> (relative
to the coordinates of the window receiving the message) at the time the
event occurs.  The mouse-pointer hot spot is the location in the mouse-pointer
bit map that the system tracks and recognizes as the position of the mouse
pointer.
<P>
If a window has the CS_HITTEST style, the system sends the window a WM_HITTEST
message when the window is about to receive a mouse message.  Most applications
pass WM_HITTEST messages on to WinDefWindowProc by default, so disabled
windows do not receive mouse messages.  Windows that specifically respond
to WM_HITTEST messages can change this default behavior.  If the window
is enabled and should receive the mouse message, the WinDefWindowProc function
(using the default processing for WM_HITTEST) returns the value HT_NORMAL.
 If the window is disabled, WinDefWindowProc returns HT_ERROR, in which
case the window does not receive the mouse message.
<P>
The default window procedure processes the WM_HITTEST message and the<I> usHit
</I>parameter in the WM_MOUSEMOVE message.  Therefore, unless an application
needs to return special values for the WM_HITTEST message or the<I> usHit
</I>parameter, it can ignore them.  One possible reason for processing the
WM_HITTEST message is for the application to react differently to a mouse
click in a disabled window.
<P>
The contents of the mouse-message parameters (<I>mp1</I> and<I> mp2</I>)
are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SHORT1FROMMP (<I>mp1</I>) contains the<I> x</I> position.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SHORT2FROMMP (<I>mp1</I>) contains the<I> y</I> position.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SHORT1FROMMP (<I>mp2</I>) contains the hit-test parameter.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
