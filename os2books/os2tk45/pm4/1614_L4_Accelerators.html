<P>
In addition to mnemonics, a menu item can have an associated<I> keyboard
accelerator</I>.  Accelerators are different from mnemonics in that the
menu need not be active for the accelerator key to work.  If you have associated
a menu item with a keyboard accelerator, display the accelerator to the
right of the menu item.  Do this in the resource-definition file by placing
a tab character (\t) in the menu text before the characters that will be
displayed on the right.  For example, if the Close item had the F3 function
key as its keyboard accelerator, the text for the item would be Close\tF3.
