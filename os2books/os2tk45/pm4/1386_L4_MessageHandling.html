<P>
In the standard direct manipulation protocol, DrgDrag does not return until
the drag set is dropped on a target window. Pickup and Drop is slightly
different, and requires a change in the handling of a Drop. Because the
operation is non-modal, DrgLazyDrag returns as soon as it has completed
drag initialiation and before a drop is performed. In the Pickup and Drop
protocol, DM_DROPNOTIFY is posted to the source window as notification of
a drop. The parameters of this message contain the pointer to the DRAGINFO
data structure allocated by the source window and the handle of the target
window. The source window should examine the<I> mp2</I> parameter to determine
if the target window and the source window are the same; if not, the source
should free the DRAGINFO upon receipt of this message. Where the target
and source are the same, the target window frees DRAGINFO after completing
the post-drop conversation. The implementation of Pickup and Drop does not
affect any of the existing post-drop conversation messages.
<P>
The DM_DROPHELP message is not supported for the Pickup and Drop protocol,
because help could be requested for any subject at any point during the
operation. If the application is to provide Drop help, it must do so from
a menu choice and explicitly code the support to be provided.
