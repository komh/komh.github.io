<P>
You can use accelerators in an application by creating an accelerator-table
resource in a resource-definition file.  Then, when the application creates
a standard frame window, the application can associate that window with
the resource.
<P>
As specified in a resource-definition file, an accelerator table consists
of a list of accelerator items, each defining the keystroke that triggers
the accelerator, the command the accelerator generates, and the accelerator's
style.  The style specifies whether the keystroke is a virtual key, a character,
or a scan code, and whether the generated message is WM_COMMAND, WM_SYSCOMMAND,
or WM_HELP; WM_COMMAND is the default.
