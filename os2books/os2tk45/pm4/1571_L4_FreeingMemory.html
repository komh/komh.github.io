<H1>Freeing Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 1605 -->
<P>
How memory for the hook is freed depends on the type of hook chain an event
is linked to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Queue (current) hook chain<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->System hook chain<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A queue hook chain is a private hook chain. It applies only to the current
calling thread that created the queue with which the hook chain is associated.
It may or may not reside in a DLL. If it is not associated with a DLL, its
memory can be freed by WinReleaseHook, as shown in the previous sample code.

<P>
A system hook chain must reside in a DLL; therefore, it affects the entire
system. WinSetHook allocates memory and associates it with a DLL. This memory
is not freed until the DLL module is freed. WinReleaseHook cannot free the
DLL's memory, because another process cannot free the DLL and its associated
memory. However, this memory can be freed by launching a thread that does
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Loads the DLL and sets the hook<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the playback sequence is complete, releases the
hook and frees the DLL, thus relinquishing its memory<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
As long as any DLL associated with the hook is alive, WinReleaseHook cannot
free the memory.
<P>
The implication here is straightforward:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a queue hook is being installed and it is not associated
with a DLL, WinReleaseHook can free its memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a system hook is being installed, its memory cannot
be freed until the DLL is freed.  WinReleaseHook has to do a DosFreeModule,
but it cannot do this for another process. The application must use DosFreeModule
to relinquish hook-allocated memory associated with a DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following sample code shows a function, called from an application's
main routine, that releases the hook and frees the memory of the hook installed
in a sample code shown earlier.
<PRE>/***********************************************************************//*  StopInputHook: This function stops the hook filtering.             */
/***********************************************************************/
void EXPENTRY StopInputHook(void)
{

/***********************************************************************/
/*  Drop a hook to our input filter routine.                           */
/***********************************************************************/
    WinReleaseHook(habDLL, NULLHANDLE, HK_INPUT, pfnInput, hMod);

/***********************************************************************/
/*  Decrement the DLL usage count.                                     */
/***********************************************************************/
    DosFreeModule(hMod);
}
