<P>
The user can insert (type) text or numeric values in an entry field when
that entry field has the keyboard focus.  An application can insert text
by using the WinSetWindowText function.  An application can insert numeric
values by using the WinSetDlgItemShort function.  The text or numeric value
is inserted into the entry field at the cursor position.
<P>
The entry field's entry mode, either insert or overstrike, determines what
happens when the user enters text.  The user sets the entry mode by pressing
the Insert key; the entry mode toggles each time the Insert key is pressed.
 The application can set the entry mode by sending the EM_SETINSERTMODE
message to the entry field.
<P>
The cursor position, identified by a blinking bar, is specified by a character
offset relative to the beginning of the text.  The user can set the cursor
position by using the mouse or the Arrow keys.  An application can set the
cursor position by using the EM_SETSEL message.  This message directs the
entry field to move the blinking bar to the given character position.
<P>
The EM_SETSEL message also sets the selection.  The selection is one or
more characters of text on which the entry field carries out an operation,
such as deleting or copying to the clipboard.  The user selects text by
pressing the Shift key while moving the cursor, or by pressing mouse button
1 while moving the mouse.  An application selects text by using the EM_SETSEL
message to specify the cursor position and the anchor point.  The selection
includes all text between the cursor position and the anchor point.  If
the cursor position and anchor point are equal, there is no selection.  An
application can retrieve the selection (cursor position and anchor point)
by using the EM_QUERYSEL message.
<P>
The user can delete characters, one at a time, by pressing the Delete key
or the Backspace key.  The Delete key deletes the character to the right
of the cursor; the Backspace key deletes the character to the left of the
cursor.  The user also can delete a group of characters by selecting them
and pressing the Delete key.  An application can delete selected text by
using the EM_CLEAR message.
<P>
An application can use the EM_QUERYCHANGED message to determine whether
the contents of an entry field have changed.
<P>
An application can prevent the user from editing an entry field by setting
the ES_READONLY style in the WinCreateWindow function or in the ENTRYFIELD
statement in the resource-definition file.  The application also can set
and query the read-only state by using the EM_SETREADONLY and ES_QUERYREADONLY
messages.
<P>
If text extends beyond the left or right edges of an entry field, the user
can scroll the text by using the Arrow keys.  An application can scroll
the text by using the EM_SETFIRSTCHAR message to specify the first character
visible at the left edge of the entry field.  For scrolling to occur, the
entry field must have the ES_AUTOSCROLL style.  An application can use the
EM_QUERYFIRSTCHAR message to obtain the first character that is currently
visible.
