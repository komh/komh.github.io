<H1>Using Direct Manipulation</H1><!-- entering slot 1335 -->
<P>
Direct manipulation is a protocol that enables the user to drag a container
item within its current window or from one window to another. The user can
drop the container item either on white space in a window or on another
item.
<P>
Direct manipulation can be performed with all views of the container control.
A function is provided so that the application is notified if an item is
dropped on another item in the container and if an item is dragged from
the container.
<P>
The user can drag any container item, whether or not it is selected. If
the user presses the drag button when the pointer is over a selected container
item, the application drags all selected items.
<P>
If the user presses the drag button when the pointer is over a container
item that is not selected, the application drags only the item that the
pointer is over.
<P>
The container control fully supports direct manipulation.
