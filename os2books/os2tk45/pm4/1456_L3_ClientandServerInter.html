<P>
A DDE conversation actually takes place between two windows: one for each
of the participating applications. Applications open a window for each conversation
in which they engage. Because a window is identified by its handle, these
windows are not necessarily visible. The window belonging to the server
application is the<I> server window</I>. The window belonging to the client
application is the<I> client window</I>.
