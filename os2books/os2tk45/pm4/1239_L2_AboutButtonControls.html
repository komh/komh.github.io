<H1>About Button Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 1259 -->
<P>
A button control can appear alone or with a group of other buttons.  When
buttons are grouped, the user can move from button to button within the
group by pressing the Arrow keys.  The user also can move among groups by
pressing the Tab key.
<P>
A user can select a button by clicking it with the mouse, pressing the spacebar
when the button has the keyboard focus, or sending a BM_CLICK message.  In
most cases, a button changes its appearance when selected.
<P>
A button control is always owned by another window, usually a dialog window
or an application's client window. A button control posts WM_COMMAND messages
or sends WM_CONTROL notification messages to its owner when a user selects
the button.  For further information on messages generated, see <A HREF="1248_L3_ButtonNotificationMe.html">Button
Notification Messages</A>. The owner window receives messages from a button
control and can send messages to the button to alter its position, appearance,
and enabled/disabled state.
<P>
To use a button control in a dialog window, an application specifies the
control in a dialog template in the application's resource-definition file.
 The application processes button messages in the dialog-window procedure.

<P>
An application creates a button control in a client window by calling WinCreateWindow,
specifying a window class of WC_BUTTON, and identifying the client window
as the owner of the button control.
