<P>
When a list box has the style LS_MULTIPLESEL or LS_EXTENDEDSEL, the user
can select more than one item at a time.  An application must use different
strategies when working with these types of lists.  For example, when responding
to an LN_ENTER control code, it is not sufficient to send a single LM_QUERYSELECTION
message, because that message will find only the first selection.  To find
all current selections, an application must continue sending LM_QUERYSELECTION
messages, using the return index of the previous message as the starting
index of the next message, until no items are returned.
