<H1>File List Box</H1><!-- entering slot 1539 -->
<P>
The File list box is a single- or multiple-selection list box that is scrollable
both horizontally and vertically. It contains all the files that meet the
filter criteria, sorted by name.
<P>
When the file dialog is a single-selection dialog, the selected file name
is placed in the<I> File Name</I> field. When the file dialog is a multiple-selection
dialog, the topmost selected file name is placed in the<I> File Name</I> field.
When the user double-clicks on a file name, the dialog exits and returns
the selected file or files to the application for opening.
<P>
