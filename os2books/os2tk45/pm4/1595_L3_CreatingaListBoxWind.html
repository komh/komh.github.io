<H1>Creating a List-Box Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1630 -->
<P>
List boxes are WC_LISTBOX class windows and are predefined by the system.
 Applications can create list boxes by calling WinCreateWindow, using WC_LISTBOX
as the window-class parameter.
<P>
A list box passes notification messages to its owner window, so an application
uses its client window, rather than the frame window, as the owner of the
list.  The client-window procedure receives the messages sent from the list
box. For example, to create a list box that completely fills the client
area of a frame window, an application would make the client window the
owner and parent of the list-box window, and make the list-box window the
same size as the client window.  This is shown in the following code fragment.

<PRE>    #define ID_LISTWINDOW   250

    HWND hwndClient,hwndList;
    RECTL rcl;

                                              /* How big is the
                                               client window? */
    WinQueryWindowRect(hwndClient, &amp;rcl);

                                              /* Make a list-box
                                                window.       */
    hwndList = WinCreateWindow(hwndClient,    /* Parent       */
        WC_LISTBOX,                           /* Class        */
        "",                                   /* Name         */
        WS_VISIBLE | LS_NOADJUSTPOS,          /* Style        */
        0, 0,                                 /* x, y         */
        rcl.xRight, rcl.yTop,                 /* cx, cy       */
        hwndClient,                           /* Owner        */
        HWND_TOP,                             /* Behind       */
        ID_LISTWINDOW,                        /* ID           */
        NULL,                                 /* Control data */
        NULL);                                /* parameters   */

</PRE>

<P>
Because the list box draws its own border, and a frame-window border already
surrounds the client area of a frame window due to the adjacent frame controls,
the effect is a double-thick border around the list box.  You can change
this effect by calling WinInflateRect to overlap the list-box border with
the surrounding frame-window border, resulting in only one list-box border.

<P>
Notice that the code specifies the list-box window style LS_NOADJUSTPOS.
 This ensures that the list box is created exactly the specified size.  If
the LS_NOADJUSTPOS style is not specified, the list-box height is rounded
down, if necessary, to make it a multiple of the item height.  Enabling
a list box to adjust its height automatically is useful for preventing partial
items being displayed at the bottom of a list box.
