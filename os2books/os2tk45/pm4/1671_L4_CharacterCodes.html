<P>
The most typical use of WM_CHAR messages is to extract a character code
from the message and display the character on the screen.  When the KC_CHAR
flag is set in the WM_CHAR message, the low word of<I> mp2</I> contains
a character code based on the current code page.  Generally, this value
is a character code (typically, an ASCII code) for the key that was pressed.
