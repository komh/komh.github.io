<H1>Allocating Memory for Container Columns</H1><!-- entering slot 1319 -->
<P>
In addition to allocating memory for records, an application also must allocate
memory for columns of data if the details view is used. In the Details view,
a container's data is displayed in columns, each of which is described in
a FIELDINFO data structure.
<P>
Memory is allocated for FIELDINFO data structures using the CM_ALLOCDETAILFIELDINFO
message.  Unlike the CM_ALLOCRECORD message, the CM_ALLOCDETAILFIELDINFO
message does not allow the application to allocate memory for additional
application data. However, the<I> pUserData</I> field of the FIELDINFO data
structure can be used to store a pointer to the application-allocated data.

<P>
Multiple FIELDINFO data structures can be allocated with the<I> nFieldInfo
</I> parameter of the CM_ALLOCDETAILFIELDINFO message.
