<H1>Exchanging Data</H1><!-- entering slot 1461 -->
<P>
Direct manipulation offers various ways for source and target applications
to exchange data. To accomplish the exchange, a separate conversation must
be established to transfer each data object from the source to the target.
The target must inform the source about the rendering mechanism it is using
and the format in which the data is to be exchanged. The target can establish
the conversations to run in parallel, or it can initiate the conversations
in a serial fashion.
<P>
The target determines which rendering mechanism and format to use in the
following manner:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Uses the native rendering mechanism and format
whenever possible.
<P>
This rendering conveys all information about the data. A target can determine
if it supports the native rendering mechanism and format by using the following
functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DrgVerifyNativeRMF<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DrgQueryNativeRMFLen<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DrgQueryNativeRMF<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Even if
it can use the native rendering mechanism and format supported by the source,
the target can elect to exchange the data in a rendering mechanism and format
that conveys less information about the object.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Uses the next best rendering mechanism and format.

<P>
This is especially good for a Copy operation, because the user does not
lose data about the object as occurs when the object is moved.
<P>
The target can determine the next best rendering mechanism and format to
use through repeated calls to DrgVerifyRMF. The calls are made starting
with the most desirable rendering mechanism and format pair and progressing
to the least desirable pair. Once a pair that the source supports has been
found, the target can exchange the data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following sample code shows how the target checks the rendering mechanism
and format:
<PRE>          /* Now, we need to look at each item in turn */          for (i = 0; i &lt; cItems; i++)
          {
            dragItem = DrgQueryDragitemPtr(dragInfo, i);

            /* Make sure we can move for a Move request */
            /* or copy for a Copy                       */
            if (((dragItem-&gt;fsSupportedOps &amp; DO_COPYABLE)   &amp;&amp;
                 (usOp == (USHORT)DO_COPY))                 ||
                ((dragItem-&gt;fsSupportedOps &amp; DO_MOVEABLE)   &amp;&amp;
                 (usOp == (USHORT)DO_MOVE)))
            {

               /* Check the rendering format */
               if (DrgVerifyRMF(dragItem, "DRM_OS2FILE", "DRF_UNKNOWN"))
                  usIndicator = DOR_DROP;
               else
                  usIndicator = DOR_NEVERDROP;
            }
            else
               usIndicator = DOR_NODROPOP;
          }

</PRE>
