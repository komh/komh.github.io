<H1>Check Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 1263 -->
<P>
<I>Check boxes</I> are similar to radio buttons, except that they can offer
<I>multiple-choice</I> selection as well as individual choice. Check boxes
offer the user a fixed list of choices, with the option of selecting more
than one, or even all.
<P>
Check boxes also toggle application features<I> on</I> or<I> off</I>. For
example, a word processing application might use a check box to let the
user turn word wrapping on or off. A check-box control sends WM_CONTROL
messages to its owner window.
