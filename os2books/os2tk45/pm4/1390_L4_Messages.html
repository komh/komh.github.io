<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DM_RENDER
<P>
This message is sent by a target to a source to request a rendering for
an object. When this message is received, the source determines if it understands
the rendering mechanism and format selected by the target for the object.
 It also confirms that it allows the operation selected by the user for
that object. The source must respond to this message before proceeding with
the rendering operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DM_RENDERCOMPLETE
<P>
This message is posted by a source to a target to notify the target that
the rendering operation has been completed by the source, either successfully
or unsuccessfully. The source can elect to let the target retry a successful
or an unsuccessful operation. In this case, it should return to its state
at the time of the drop for that object and indicate, in the message, that
a retry is allowed.
<P>
Support for this message by a source is optional. If this message is not
supported, then:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<UL>DM_ENDCONVERSATION

<P>
This message is sent by a target to a source to notify the source that the
rendering operation is complete and that the conversation is terminated.
When this message is received, the entire drop operation for the object
is complete. The source can now release any resources it had allocated to
the drop and rendering operations. When the reply is received, the target
can release the resources it had allocated to the operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
