Help subtable.
<P>
A help subtable is an array of records, preceded by a value that specifies
the size of each help-subtable record.
<PRE>typedef USHORT _HELPSUBTABLE {
  <A HREF="1150_L2_USHORT.html">USHORT</A>     <A VIEWPORT DEPENDENT HREF="569_L2H_HELPSUBTABLEFieldusS.html"><!-- extra bytes: 04 02 -->usSubitemSize</A>;        /*  Size of each record of the help subtable. */
  <A HREF="1150_L2_USHORT.html">USHORT</A>     <A VIEWPORT DEPENDENT HREF="570_L2H_HELPSUBTABLEFieldHel.html"><!-- extra bytes: 04 02 -->HelpSubTableEntry[]</A>;  /*  Help subtable records. */
};
</PRE>

<P>
The first entry in the help subtable indicates the size of the records that
follow in the subtable. Each of the following entries in the help subtable
is a record that consists of a Field ID parameter, a Help Panel ID parameter,
and an optional array of application-related USHORT integers. The minimum
number of words in the record is two: the Field ID and the Help Panel ID.
The last record in the subtable must be a NULL entry.
<P>
The Field ID is the symbolic constant for a field from which the user can
request help. The Field ID can identify a control, a menu item, or a message
box, and must be unique across the help subtable. The value 0xFFFF is reserved
for use by the Help Manager.
<P>
The Help Panel ID is the resource ID (res) of the contextual help panel
to be associated with the field in the Field ID parameter. This is the panel
to be displayed when the user requests help for the field.
<P>
The optional array of USHORT integers is ignored by the Help Manager and
can be used to store information of relevance to the application.
<P>
There can be a maximum of 16,000 help subtables for a given help instance
and each subtable can have a maximum of 64K bytes of data.
<P>
The following figure contains the declaration of a help subtable that contains
only Field IDs and Help Panel IDs. In this subtable, each of the records
after the size entry consists of 1 Field ID and 1 Help Panel ID for a size
of 2.  Note that the last record is filled with NULLs (0) to indicate the
end of the array.
<PRE>HELPSUBTABLE HelpSubTable[] =
{
   2,                           /* Size of each record */
   FIELD_ID_1, IDRES_HELP1,     /* The first record    */
   FIELD_ID_2, IDRES_HELP2,     /* The second record   */
   FIELD_ID_3, IDRES_HELP3,     /* The third record    */
   FIELD_ID_4, IDRES_HELP4,     /* The fourth record   */
   FIELD_ID_5, IDRES_HELP5,     /* The fifth record    */
   FIELD_ID_6, IDRES_HELP6,     /* The sixth record    */
   0,          0                /* NULL record == end of the array */
}
