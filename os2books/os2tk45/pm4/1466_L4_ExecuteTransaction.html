<P>
A PM application can use the DDE protocol to cause commands to be executed
in another application. Such remote executions are performed by the WM_DDE_EXECUTE
transaction.
<P>
To execute a remote command, the client application posts to the server
a WM_DDE_EXECUTE message containing a pointer to a shared-memory object
that contains a DDESTRUCT data structure and a command string.
<P>
The server attempts to execute the specified string according to some agreed-upon
protocol. If successful, the server posts a positive WM_DDE_ACK message
to the client. If unsuccessful, a negative WM_DDE_ACK message is posted.
