<P>
The user can end a direct manipulation operation in one of the three following
ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pressing the Esc key to cancel the operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Releasing the drag button when the pointer is over
a target that cannot accept the drop
<P>
This action is equivalent to pressing the Esc key. When the pointer is over
a target that can accept the drop, the target is informed of the drop, and
the source is given the window handle of the target.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pressing the F1 key to request help
<P>
A DM_DROPHELP message is posted to the target. This enables the target to
provide the user with assistance regarding:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->What would happen if the user dropped the object
on that target<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Why the target cannot accept a particular drop<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> The
source sees this termination of the direct manipulation operation as a cancelation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
