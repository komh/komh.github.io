<H1>Creating a Modal Dialog Window</H1><!-- entering slot 1391 -->
<P>
The easiest way to use a modal dialog window is to define a dialog template
in the resource file (as in the preceding section), and then, call the WinDlgBox
function, specifying the dialog-window resource identifier and a pointer
to the dialog procedure.  WinDlgBox loads the dialog-window resource, displays
the dialog window, and handles all user input until the user dismisses the
dialog window.  The dialog procedure receives messages when the dialog window
is created (WM_INITDLG) and other messages each time the user interacts
with a dialog item (enters text in entry fields or selects a button, for
example).
<P>
You must specify both the parent and owner windows when loading a dialog
window using the WinDlgBox function.  Generally, the parent window will
be HWND_DESKTOP and the owner will be a client window in your application.

<P>
Dialog windows typically contain buttons that send WM_COMMAND messages when
selected by the user.  WM_COMMAND messages passed to the WinDefDlgProc function
result in the WinDismissDlg function's being called, with the window identifier
of the source button as the return code (from WinDismissDlg).  Dialog windows
with either<B> OK</B> or<B> Cancel</B> as their only button can ignore WM_COMMAND
messages, allowing them to be passed to WinDefDlgProc.  WinDefDlgProc calls
WinDismissDlg to dismiss the dialog window and returns the DID_OK or DID_CANCEL
code.
<P>
Passing WM_COMMAND messages to WinDefDlgProc means that all button presses
in the dialog window dismiss the dialog window.  If you want certain buttons
to initiate operations without closing the dialog window, or if you want
to perform some processing without closing the dialog window, handle the
WM_COMMAND messages in the dialog procedure.
<P>
If you handle WM_COMMAND messages in the dialog procedure, you must call
WinDismissDlg to dismiss the dialog window.  Your dialog procedure passes
the DID_OK code to WinDismissDlg if the user selects the<B> OK</B> button
or the DID_CANCEL code if the user selects the<B> Cancel</B> button.
<P>
When you call WinDismissDlg or pass the WM_COMMAND message to WinDefDlgProc,
the dialog window is dismissed, and the WinDlgBox function returns the value
passed to WinDismissDlg.  This return value identifies the button selected.

<P>
An alternative to using WinDlgBox is to call the individual functions that
duplicate its functionality, as shown in the following code fragment:
<P>

<PRE>    HWND  hwndDlg;
    ULONG ulResult;

    hwndDlg = WinLoadDlg(...);
    ulResult = WinProcessDlg(hwndDlg);
    WinDestroyWindow(hwndDlg);

</PRE>

<P>
After calling the WinProcessDlg function, your dialog procedure must call
WinDismissDlg to dismiss the dialog window.  Although the dialog window
is<I> dismissed</I> (hidden), it still exists.  You must call the WinDestroyWindow
function to destroy a dialog window if it was loaded using the WinLoadDlg
function.  WinDlgBox automatically destroys a dialog window before returning.

<P>
If you want to manipulate individual items in a dialog window, or add a
menu after loading the dialog window (but before calling WinProcessDlg),
it is better to make individual calls rather than call WinDlgBox.  Individual
calls also are useful for querying individual dialog items-to determine
the contents of an entry-field control after a dialog window is closed but
before it is destroyed, for example.  Destroying a dialog window also destroys
any dialog-item control windows that are child windows of the dialog window.
