<P>
An application can query and set the highlighted and checked states of its
buttons by sending messages to them.  An application can obtain the handle
of a button by calling WinWindowFromID, using the parent window handle and
the identifier of the button.  In the case of a dialog window, the parent
window would be the dialog window, and the identifier would be the button
identifier from the dialog template.
<P>
Button-control text is stored as window text.  An application can set and
retrieve this text by using the WinSetWindowText and WinQueryWindowText
functions.  To set the size, position, and visibility of a button control,
an application uses the standard window functions.
