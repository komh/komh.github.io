<H1>Performance Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 1462 -->
<P>
When context information about an object might be lost because of using
a less-desirable rendering mechanism and format, the target can elect to
pick a common mechanism and format that achieves the best performance. This
is done the same way that the next best rendering mechanism and format is
selected, proceeding from the best-performing rendering to the worst.
<P>
Regardless of the rendering mechanism used, the target might need to prepare
the source for the rendering of the object. This is necessary when the source
needs to create a window in order to handle the conversation. This preparation
is done by sending a DM_RENDERPREPARE message to the<I> hwndSource</I> window
in the DRAGINFO data structure. This message need be sent only when the
DC_PREPARE flag is on in the<I> fsControl</I> field of the DRAGITEM data
structure. When the source receives this message, it performs any necessary
preparation for the rendering and fills in the<I> hwndItem</I> field in
the DRAGITEM data structure, thereby allowing the target to establish conversation
with that window.
