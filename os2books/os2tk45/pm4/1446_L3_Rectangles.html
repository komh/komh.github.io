<P>
Locations of window rectangles are described by RECTL structures, which
contain the coordinates of two points that define the lower-left and upper-right
corners of the rectangle.  An empty rectangle is one that has no area:  either
its right coordinate is less than or equal to its left coordinate, or its
top coordinate is less than or equal to its bottom coordinate.
<P>
There are two types of rectangles in OS/2:  inclusive-inclusive and inclusive-exclusive.
 In inclusive-exclusive rectangles, the lower-left coordinate of the rectangle
is included within the rectangle area, while the upper-right coordinate
is excluded from the rectangle area.  In an inclusive-inclusive rectangle,
both the lower-left and upper-right coordinates are included in the rectangle.

<P>
In general, graphics operations involving device coordinates (such as regions,
bit maps and bit blts, and window management) use inclusive-exclusive rectangles.
 All other graphics operations, such as GPI functions that define paths,
use inclusive-inclusive rectangles.
