<P>
The user can cut, copy, and paste text in an entry field by using the Shift+Delete
and Ctrl+Insert key combinations.  An application, either by itself or in
response to the user, can cut, copy, and paste text by using the EM_CUT,
EM_COPY, and EM_PASTE messages.  An application can use the ES_CUT and EM_COPY
messages to copy the selected text to the clipboard.  The EM_CUT message
also deletes the text (EM_COPY does not).  The EM_PASTE message copies the
text on the clipboard to the current position in the entry field, replacing
any existing text with the copied text.  An application can delete the selected
text, without copying it to the clipboard, by using the EM_CLEAR message.
