<H1>Directory List Box</H1><!-- entering slot 1540 -->
<P>
The Directory list box is a single-selection list box that is scrollable
both horizontally and vertically.
<P>
The Directory list box displays the path in the<I> szFullFile</I> field
of the FILEDLG data structure as a list of each parent subdirectory. Any
subdirectories of the selected directory also are displayed. Each directory
level is indented to show the path, and the current working directory level
is indicated by an arrow. The top entry is always the root directory, with
the drive specification preceding it. When the<I> szFullFile</I> field is
NULL, the current path of the current drive is displayed. The user selects
a new subdirectory by double-clicking on the subdirectory name. This action
updates the Directory list box.
<P>
