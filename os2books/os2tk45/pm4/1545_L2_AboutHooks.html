<H1>About Hooks</H1><!-- entering slot 1579 -->
<P>
Many operating system functions provide points where an application can
<I>hook in</I> its own code to enhance or override the default processing
of the function. Most hooks enable an application to monitor some aspect
of the message stream. For example, the input hook enables an application
to monitor all messages posted to a particular message queue.
<P>
A hook function can be associated with the system-message queue, so that
it monitors messages for all applications. These system-queue hook functions
can be called in the context of any application. However, they must be defined
in separate dynamic link library (DLL) modules, because it is not possible
to call application-module procedures from other applications.
<P>
A hook function can also be associated with the message queue of an individual
thread, so that it monitors messages for that thread only. These message-queue
hook functions are called only in the context of the thread. Therefore,
these hook functions are typically defined locally.
<P>
OS/2 operating system contains many types of hooks, and the system maintains
a separate<I> hook list</I> for each type of hook supported.
