<P>
If an application provides or defines transforms from the newly defined
mechanism to existing mechanisms, performance information about the transform
between mechanisms should be provided. This aids the application developer
in choosing the appropriate transform when it encounters an application
that transforms from an unknown native mechanism to several different known
mechanisms.
