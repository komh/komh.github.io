<H1>Message Loops</H1><!-- entering slot 1667 -->
<P>
Every application with a message queue is responsible for retrieving the
messages from that queue.  An application can do this by using a message
loop, usually in the application's main function, that retrieves messages
from the message queue and dispatches them to the appropriate windows.  The
message loop consists of two calls: one to the WinGetMsg function; the other
to the WinDispatchMsg function.  The message loop has the following form:

<P>

<PRE>    HAB hab;
    QMSG qmsg;

    while (WinGetMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg, NULL, 0, 0))
        WinDispatchMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg);

</PRE>

<P>
An application starts the message loop after creating the message queue
and at least one application window.  Once started, the message loop continues
to retrieve messages from the message queue and to dispatch (send) them
to the appropriate windows.  WinDispatchMsg sends each message to the window
specified by the window handle in the message.
<P>
The following figure illustrates the typical routing of an input message
through the operating system's and application's message loops.

<P>
Input Message Processing Loop Only one message loop is needed for a message
queue, even if the queue contains messages for more than one window. Each
queue message is a QMSG structure that contains the handle of the window
to which the message belongs.  WinDispatchMsg always dispatches the message
to the proper window.  WinGetMsg retrieves messages from the queue in first-in,
first-out (FIFO) order, so the messages are dispatched to windows in the
same order they are received.
<P>
If there are no messages in the queue, the operating system temporarily
stops processing the WinGetMsg function until a message arrives.  This means
that processor time that, otherwise, would be spent waiting for a message
can be given to the applications (or threads) that do have messages in their
queues.
<P>
The message loop continues to retrieve and dispatch messages until WinGetMsg
retrieves a WM_QUIT message.  This message causes the function to return
FALSE, terminating the loop.  In most cases, terminating the message loop
is the first step in terminating the application.  An application can terminate
its own loop by posting the WM_QUIT message in its own queue.
<P>
An application can modify its message loop in a variety of ways.  For example,
it can retrieve messages from the queue without dispatching them to a window.
 This is useful for applications that post messages without specifying a
window.  (These messages apply to the application rather than a specific
window; they have NULL window handles.)  Also, an application can direct
the WinGetMsg function to search for specific messages, leaving other messages
in the queue.  This is useful for applications that temporarily need to
bypass the usual FIFO order of the message queue.
