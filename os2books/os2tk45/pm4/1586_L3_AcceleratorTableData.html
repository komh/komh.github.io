<P>
An accelerator table consists of individual accelerator items.  Each item
in the table is represented by an ACCEL structure that defines the accelerator's
style, keystroke, and command identifier.  Typically, an application defines
these aspects of an accelerator in a resource-definition file, but the ACCEL
structure also can be built in memory at run time. An accelerator table
is represented by an ACCELTABLE structure that specifies the number of accelerator
items in the table, the code page used for the keystrokes in the accelerator
items, and an array of ACCEL structures (one for each item in the table).
 Applications that use ACCELTABLE structures directly must allocate sufficient
memory to hold all the items in the table.
