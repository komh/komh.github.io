<P>
Unlike traditional applications that take complete control of the computer's
keyboard, mouse, and screen, PM applications must share these resources
with other applications that are running at the same time.  All applications
run independently and rely on the operating system to help them manage shared
resources.  The operating system does this by controlling the operation
of each application, communicating with each application when there is keyboard
or mouse input or when an application must move and size its windows.
