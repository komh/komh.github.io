<P>
The target can provide a customized pointer to be displayed while it is
the target of the drop by calling DrgSetDragPointer after it starts processing
the DM_DRAGOVER message but before it sends a response. It also can provide
a customized image (icon, bit map, and so forth) to be displayed while it
is the target by calling DrgSetDragImage. This capability may be used by
a target to provide additional visible feedback to the user. The pointer
is reverted to the default when it is moved to a new target.
