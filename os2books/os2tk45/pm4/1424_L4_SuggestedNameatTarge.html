<H1>Suggested Name at Target</H1><!-- entering slot 1450 -->
<P>
When dragging an object, for example, a file, from one container to another,
it is important to know the name the object should have at the target. This
may or may not be the same name it had at the source. This name enables
the target to check if another object with the same name already exists
at the target and to take the appropriate action. For example, a target
container might not allow the user to drop the object if an object by that
same name already exists at the target.
