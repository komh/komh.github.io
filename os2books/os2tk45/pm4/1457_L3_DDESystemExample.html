<H1>DDE System Example</H1><!-- entering slot 1485 -->
<P>
DDE has many potential uses in real-time data acquisition applications.
Consider the example of a DDE-based, real-time system for tracking portfolios.
Two hypothetical PM applications cooperate in this example. One application,
named the<I> collector</I>, is a specialized interface that draws data from
an online data service. The other application is a spreadsheet. Both applications
use the DDE protocol. The following figure shows the sample spreadsheet
layout:
<PRE>
                   A           B           C          D

          1      <U><I>Stock</I></U>       <U><I>Shares</I></U>     <U><I>Price</I></U>     <U><I>Extension</I></U>

          2      ABCD        1000        148       148000

          3      EFGH        2000        26        52000

          4      IJKL        200         24        4800

          5      MNOP        2000        93        186000

          6                                        390800

</PRE>

<P>
Without DDE, this spreadsheet could be updated by using the clipboard to
manually copy numbers from the screen display of the collector application
to the spreadsheet. This would require screen sharing or switching between
applications. The user also would have to pay close attention to the price
data, then undertake the data exchange personally whenever the price data
changes.
<P>
With DDE, this system could be much more automatic, providing the spreadsheet
with the current values for multiple data items, without user intervention.
DDE enables the user to set up an exchange between the two applications
that updates the spreadsheet whenever a change occurs in the value of specified
stocks. After this connection is established, the cell values in the spreadsheet
always reflect the most current data available from the collector. This
system facilitates the timely analysis of real-time data.
<P>
The usefulness of the DDE protocol is not restricted to specialized real-time
data-acquisition applications. Productivity software, in general, can benefit
significantly from the protocol. For example, a monthly report is prepared
using word processor, and the report includes graphs generated in a separate
business-graphics package. Without DDE, someone must manually copy and paste
each month's new graphs into each month's report. With DDE, the word processor
can establish a permanent link to the graphics application so that any changes
made to the graphs are reflected in the word-processing document, either
automatically or on request.
<P>
The following diagram shows a detailed view of the workings of the DDE protocol
and describes the collector and spreadsheet interaction and illustrates
the forwarding of stock quotes from the collector application to the spreadsheet.
For simplicity, this example is limited to the exchange of quotes for a
single stock, ABCD.

<P>
The collector DDE server application is started first. Typically, applications
designed to operate as dedicated DDE servers have a user interface for initialization,
and then run minimized. As part of the initialization process, the collector
DDE server application performs the necessary tasks (such as entering passwords
and testing) to ensure that it can provide data to clients.
<P>
The spreadsheet is started next, and the stock-portfolio document is loaded.
At this time, the spreadsheet calls WinDdeInitiate, which sends a WM_DDE_INITIATE
message to all top-level frame windows, that is, frame windows that have
HWND_DESKTOP as their parent. The WM_DDE_INITIATE message is a request to
initiate an exchange with an application on a specified topic-in this case,
STOCKS. An application can accept this message by responding with a positive
WM_DDE_INITIATEACK message, or decline the message by passing the message
on to WinDefWindowProc. If no application accepts the request, the spreadsheet
assigns an error value to the external reference and its DDE activity concludes.

<P>
If the collector acknowledges the request, the spreadsheet can use the newly
established exchange to request that the collector provide continuous updates
on a specified data item. To make this request, the spreadsheet posts a
WM_DDE_ADVISE message to the collector (actually, to a window within the
collector that acts as the message recipient for DDE messages), indicating
that updates must be sent every time there is a new value available for
the data item, ABCD, and that the updates should be in a particular format-for
example, DDEFMT_TEXT.
<P>
Upon receiving this message, the collector application records the request
in its database and posts a WM_DDE_ACK message to the spreadsheet. From
then on, whenever the collector receives a new ABCD stock quote, it posts
a WM_DDE_DATA message to the window in the spreadsheet that initiated the
exchange. Each of these messages carries a pointer to a shared-memory object
that contains the data, rendered in the requested format. When the spreadsheet
receives such a message, it retrieves the data from the referenced memory
object and uses the data to update the value of the cell containing the
external reference.
<P>
The periodic updates continue until the spreadsheet document is closed.
At that point, the spreadsheet application posts a WM_DDE_UNADVISE message
to the collector application, indicating that further updating is unnecessary.
Upon receipt of this message, the collector application removes the corresponding
data request from its database and posts a positive WM_DDE_ACK message back
to the spreadsheet.
<P>
Finally, unless the spreadsheet initiates other data exchanges under this
same topic, it posts a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message to the collector application,
indicating the end of the DDE transaction. The collector application responds
with a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> At any time during the transaction, both the spreadsheet and
collector are free to post a WM_DDE_TERMINATE message to the other application.
