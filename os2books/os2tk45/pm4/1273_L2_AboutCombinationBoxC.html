<P>
Combination-box controls enable the user to enter data by typing in the
entry field or by choosing from a list in the list box. A combination-box
control automatically manages the interaction between the entry field and
the list box. For example, when the user chooses an item in the list box,
the combination-box control displays the text for that item in the entry
field. Then, the user can edit the text without affecting the item in the
list box. When the user types a letter in the entry field, the combination-box
control scrolls the list box contents so that items beginning with that
letter become visible.
