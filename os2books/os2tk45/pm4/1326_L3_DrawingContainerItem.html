<P>
The container control enables your application to paint the container's
background, draw the container items, or both. If the CA_OWNERPAINTBACKGROUND
attribute is set, the container control sends the CM_PAINTBACKGROUND message
to itself. Your application can control background painting by subclassing
the container control and intercepting the CM_PAINTBACKGROUND message. CA_OWNERPAINTBACKGROUND
is an attribute of the CNRINFO data structure's<I> flWindowAttr</I> field.

<P>
To support<I> ownerdraw</I>, the drawing of container items by the application,
the container control provides the CA_OWNERDRAW attribute of the CNRINFO
data structure's<I> flWindowAttr</I> field. If this attribute is set and
the application processes the WM_DRAWITEM window message, the application
is responsible for drawing each container item, including the types of emphasis.

<P>
In addition, the container control supports ownerdraw for each column in
the Details view. This support is indicated by the CFA_OWNER attribute,
which is specified in the FIELDINFO data structure's<I> flData</I> field.

<P>
If the CA_OWNERDRAW attribute or CFA_OWNER attribute is set, the container
control sends the application a WM_DRAWITEM message with a pointer to an
OWNERITEM data structure as the<I> owneritem</I> parameter.
