<H1>Responding to a User's Menu Choice</H1><!-- entering slot 1656 -->
<P>
When a user chooses a menu item, the client window procedure receives a
WM_COMMAND message with SHORT1FROMMP(mp1) equal to the menu identifier of
the chosen item.  Your application must use the menu identifier to guide
its response to the choice.  Typically, the code in the client window procedure
resembles the following code fragment:
<PRE>       case WM_COMMAND:
           DoMenuCommand(hwnd, SHORT1FROMMP(mp1));
           return 0;

</PRE>
The function that translates the menu identifier into an action typically
resembles the following code fragment:
<PRE>
    VOID DoMenuCommand(
    HWND hwnd,
    USHORT usItemID)
    {

        /* Test the menu item. */
        switch (usItemID) {
            case IDM_FI_NEW:
                DoNew(hwnd);
                break;

          .
          . /* etc. */
          .

        }
    }

</PRE>

<P>
The menu window sends a WM_MENUSELECT message every time the menu selection
changes.  SHORT1FROMMP(mp1) contains the identifier of the item that is
changing state, and SHORT2FROMMP(mp2) is a 16-bit Boolean value that describes
whether or not the item is chosen; the<I> mp2</I> parameter contains the
handle of the menu.
<P>
If the Boolean value is FALSE, the item is selected but not chosen; for
example, the user may have moved the cursor or mouse pointer over the item
while the button was down.  An application can use this message to display
Help information at the bottom of the application window.  The return value
is ignored.
<P>
If the Boolean value is TRUE, the item is chosen-that is, the user pressed
Enter or released the mouse button while an item was selected.  If the application
returns FALSE, the menu does not generate a WM_COMMAND, WM_SYSCOMMAND, or
WM_HELP message, and the menu is not dismissed.
