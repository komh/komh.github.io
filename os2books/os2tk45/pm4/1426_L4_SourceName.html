<P>
In some direct-manipulation operations, it is possible for the target to
perform the necessary action on the source object without the source's participation.
If the source allows this, the target name should be filled in with the
name of the source object. For example, a file folder would put the name
of the source file into this field, such as AUTOEXEC.BAT. A database manager,
on the other hand, might fill this field with some location information
so the target could find a particular record or field within the database.
