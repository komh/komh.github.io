<H1>Origins of Windows Sockets</H1><!-- entering slot 145 -->
<P>
The Windows Sockets project had its origins in a Birds Of A Feather session
held at Interop '91 in San Jose on October 10, 1991.  A committee was established,
and an intensive debate via email resulted in the creation of a first draft
specification, which was largely based on submissions from JSB and NetManage.
 This draft, and issues arising from it, were debated at a committee meeting
hosted by Microsoft in Redmond, WA on December 9, 1991.  Following further
email discussions, a working group was established to develop the specification
into its current form.
<P>
The following people participated in the process as committee members, in
working meetings, or in email review.  The authors would like to thank everyone
who participated in any way, and apologize in advance if we have omitted
anyone.
