<H1>Microsoft Windows and Windows-specific extensions</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
This API is intended to be usable within all implementations and versions
of Microsoft Windows from Microsoft Windows Version 3.0 onwards.  It thus
provides for Windows Sockets implementations and Windows Sockets applications
in both 16 and 32 bit operating environments.
<P>
Windows Sockets makes provisions for multithreaded Windows processes.  A
process contains one or more threads of execution.  In the Windows 3.1 non-multithreaded
world, a task corresponds to a process with a single thread. All references
to threads in this document refer to actual "threads" in multithreaded Windows
environments.  In non multithreaded environments (such as Windows 3.0),
use of the term thread refers to a Windows process.
<P>
The Microsoft Windows extensions included in Windows Sockets are provided
to allow application developers to create software which conforms to the
Windows programming model.  It is expected that this will facilitate the
creation of robust and high-performance applications, and will improve the
cooperative multitasking of applications within non-preemptive versions
of Windows.  With the exception of <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>and <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> their use is not
mandatory.
