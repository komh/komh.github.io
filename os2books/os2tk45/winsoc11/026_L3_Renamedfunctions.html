<H1>Renamed functions</H1><!-- entering slot 27 -->
<P>
In two cases it was necessary to rename functions which are used in Berkeley
Sockets in order to avoid clashes with other APIs.
<P>
<B>close() &amp;</B> <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A> In
Berkeley Sockets, sockets are represented by standard file descriptors,
and so the<B> close()</B> function can be used to close sockets as well
as regular files.  While nothing in the Windows Sockets API prevents an
implementation from using regular file handles to identify sockets, nothing
requires it either.  Socket descriptors are not presumed to correspond to
regular file handles, and file operations such as<B> read()</B>,<B> write()</B>,
and<B> close()</B> cannot be assumed to work correctly when applied to socket
descriptors.  Sockets must be closed by using the <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()
</A>routine.  Using the<B> close()</B> routine to close a socket is incorrect
and the effects of doing so are undefined by this specification.
<P>
<B>ioctl() &amp;</B> <A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket()</A>
<P>
Various C language run-time systems use the<B> ioctl()</B> routine for purposes
unrelated to Windows Sockets.  For this reason we have defined the routine
<A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket()</A> which is used to handle
socket functions which in the Berkeley Software Distribution are performed
using<B> ioctl()</B> and<B> fcntl()</B>.
<P>
