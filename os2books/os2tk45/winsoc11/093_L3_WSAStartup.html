<UL> The highest version of Windows
Sockets API support that the caller can use. The high order byte specifies
the minor version (revision) number; the low-order byte specifies the major
version number.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> A
pointer to the<B> WSADATA</B> data structure that is to receive details

</UL>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function<B> must</B> be the first Windows Sockets function called by
an application or DLL.  It allows an application to specify the version
of Windows Sockets API required and to retrieve details of the specific
Windows Sockets implementation.  The application may only issue further
Windows Sockets API functions after a successful<B> WSAStartup()</B> invocation.

<P>
In order to support future Windows Sockets implementations and applications
which may have functionality differences from Windows Sockets 1.1, a negotiation
takes place in<B> WSAStartup()</B>.  The caller of<B> WSAStartup()</B> and
the Windows Sockets DLL indicate to each other the highest version that
they can support, and each confirms that the other's highest version is
acceptable.  Upon entry to<B> WSAStartup()</B>, the Windows Sockets DLL
examines the version requested by the application.  If this version is higher
than the lowest version supported by the DLL, the call succeeds and the
DLL returns in<I> wHighVersion</I> the highest version it supports and in
<I>wVersion</I> the minimum of its high version and<I> wVersionRequested.
</I>The Windows Sockets DLL then assumes that the application will use<I> wVersion.
</I> If the<I> wVersion</I> field of the<B> WSADATA</B> structure is unacceptable
to the caller, it should call <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()
</A>and either search for another Windows Sockets DLL or fail to initialize.

<P>
This negotiation allows both a Windows Sockets DLL and a Windows Sockets
application to support a range of Windows Sockets versions.  An application
can successfully utilize a Windows Sockets DLL if there is any overlap in
the version ranges.  The following chart gives examples of how<B> WSAStartup()
</B>works in conjunction with different application and Windows Sockets
DLL versions:

</PRE>

<P>
The following code fragment demonstrates how an application which supports
only version 1.1 of Windows Sockets makes a<B> WSAStartup()</B> call:
<P>

<PRE>WORD wVersionRequested;
WSADATA wsaData;
int err;

wVersionRequested = MAKEWORD( 1, 1 );

err = WSAStartup( wVersionRequested, &amp;wsaData );
if ( err ]= 0 ) {
    /* Tell the user that we couldn't find a useable */
    /* winsock.dll.                                  */
    return;
}

/* Confirm that the Windows Sockets DLL supports 1.1.*/
/* Note that if the DLL supports versions greater    */
/* than 1.1 in addition to 1.1, it will still return */
/* 1.1 in wVersion since that is the version we      */
/* requested.                                        */

if ( LOBYTE( wsaData.wVersion ) ]= 1 !!
         HIBYTE( wsaData.wVersion ) ]= 1 ) {
    /* Tell the user that we couldn't find a useable */
    /* winsock.dll.                                  */
    WSACleanup( );
    return;
}

/* The Windows Sockets DLL is acceptable.  Proceed.  */
</PRE>

<P>
And this code fragment demonstrates how a Windows Sockets DLL which supports
only version 1.1 performs the WSAStartup() negotiation:
<PRE>/* Make sure that the version requested is &gt;= 1.1.   */
/* The low byte is the major version and the high    */
/* byte is the minor version.                        */

if ( LOBYTE( wVersionRequested ) &lt; 1 !!
     ( LOBYTE( wVersionRequested ) == 1 &amp;&amp;
       HIBYTE( wVersionRequested ) &lt; 1 ) {
    return WSAVERNOTSUPPORTED;
}

/* Since we only support 1.1, set both wVersion and  */
/* wHighVersion to 1.1.                              */

lpWsaData-&gt;wVersion = MAKEWORD( 1, 1 );
lpWsaData-&gt;wHighVersion = MAKEWORD( 1, 1 );
</PRE>

<P>
Once an application has made a successful<B> WSAStartup()</B> call, it may
proceed to make other Windows Sockets API calls as needed.  When it has
finished using the services of the Windows Sockets DLL, the application
must call <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> in order to
allow the DLL to free any resources allocated by the Windows Sockets DLL
for the application. Details of the actual Windows Sockets implementation
are described in the WSAData structure defined as follows:
<P>

<PRE>struct WSAData {
        WORD            wVersion;
        WORD            wHighVersion;
        char            szDescriptionφWSADESCRIPTION_<!-- entering slot 116 -->LEN+1∙;
        char            szSystemStatusφWSASYSSTATUS_LEN+1∙;
        unsigned short  iMaxSockets;
        unsigned short  iMaxUdpDg;
        char FAR *      lpVendorInfo
};
</PRE>

<P>
The members of this structure are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>wVersion</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> The version of the Windows Sockets
specification that the Windows Sockets DLL expects the caller to use.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> wHighVersion
</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The highest version of the Windows Sockets specification
that this DLL can support (also encoded as above).  Normally this will be
the same as wVersion.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> szDescription</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A
null-terminated ASCII string into which the Windows Sockets DLL copies a
description of the Windows Sockets implementation, including vendor identification.
 The text (up to 256 characters in length) may contain any characters, but
vendors are cautioned against including control and formatting characters:
the most likely use that an application will put this to is to display it
(possibly truncated) in a status message.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> szSystemStatus
</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>A null-terminated ASCII string into which the
Windows Sockets DLL copies relevant status or configuration information.
 The Windows Sockets DLL should use this field only if the information might
be useful to the user or support staff: it should not be considered as an
extension of the szDescription field.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> iMaxSockets
</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The maximum number of sockets which a single
process can potentially open. A Windows Sockets implementation may provide
a global pool of sockets for allocation to any process; alternatively it
may allocate per-process resources for sockets.  The number may well reflect
the way in which the Windows Sockets DLL or the networking software was
configured.  Application writers may use this number as a crude indication
of whether the Windows Sockets implementation is usable by the application.
 For example, an X Windows server might check iMaxSockets when first started:
if it is less than 8, the application would display an error message instructing
the user to reconfigure the networking software.  (This is a situation in
which the szSystemStatus text might be used.)  Obviously there is no guarantee
that a particular application can actually allocate iMaxSockets sockets,
since there may be other Windows Sockets applications in use.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> iMaxUdpDg
</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The size in bytes of the largest UDP datagram
that can be sent or received by a Windows Sockets application.  If the implementation
imposes no limit, iMaxUdpDg is zero.  In many implementations of Berkeley
sockets, there is an implicit limit of 8192 bytes on UDP datagrams (which
are fragmented if necessary).  A Windows Sockets implementation may impose
a limit based, for instance, on the allocation of fragment reassembly buffers.
 The minimum value of iMaxUdpDg for a compliant Windows Sockets implementation
is 512.  Note that regardless of the value of iMaxUdpDg, it is inadvisable
to attempt to send a broadcast datagram which is larger than the Maximum
Transmission Unit (MTU) for the network.  (The Windows Sockets API does
not provide a mechanism to discover the MTU, but it must be no less than
512 bytes.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> lpVendorInfo</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A
far pointer to a vendor-specific data structure.  The definition of this
structure (if supplied) is beyond the scope of this specification.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application may call<B> WSAStartup()</B> more than once if it needs to
obtain the WSAData structure information more than once.  However, the<I> wVersionRequired
</I>parameter is assumed to be the same on all calls to<B> WSAStartup()</B>;
that is, an application cannot<!-- entering slot 117 --> change the version
of Windows Sockets it expects after the initial call to<B> WSAStartup().
</B>
<P>
There must be one <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> call
corresponding to every<B> WSAStartup()</B> call to allow third-party DLLs
to make use of a Windows Sockets DLL on behalf of an application.  This
means, for example, that if an application calls<B> WSAStartup()</B> three
times, it must call <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> three
times.  The first two calls to <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()
</A>do nothing except decrement an internal counter; the final <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()
</A>call does all necessary resource deallocation for the task.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
<B>WSAStartup()</B> returns zero if successful.  Otherwise it returns one
of the error codes listed below.  Note that the normal mechanism whereby
the application calls <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()
</A>to determine the error code cannot be used, since the Windows Sockets
DLL may not have established the client data area where the "last error"
information is stored.
<P>
<B>Notes For Windows Sockets Suppliers</B>
<P>
Each Windows Sockets application<B> must</B> make a<B> WSAStartup()</B> call
before issuing any other Windows Sockets API calls. This function can thus
be utilized for initialization purposes.
<P>
Further issues are discussed in the notes for <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A>.
