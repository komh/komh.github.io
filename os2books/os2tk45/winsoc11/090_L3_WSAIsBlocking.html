<PRE>#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;</PRE>
 
<P>
<B>BOOL PASCAL FAR WSAIsBlocking ( void );</B>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function allows a task to determine if it is executing while waiting
for a previous blocking call to complete.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
The return value is TRUE if there is an outstanding blocking function awaiting
completion.  Otherwise, it is FALSE.
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
Although a call issued on a blocking socket appears to an application program
as though it "blocks", the Windows Sockets DLL has to relinquish the processor
to allow other applications to run.  This means that it is possible for
the application which issued the blocking call to be re-entered, depending
on the message(s) it receives.  In this instance, the<B> WSAIsBlocking()
</B>function can be used to ascertain whether the task has been re-entered
while waiting for an outstanding blocking call to complete. Note that Windows
Sockets prohibits more than one outstanding call per thread.
<P>
<B>Notes For Windows Sockets Suppliers</B>
<P>
A Windows Sockets implementation must prohibit more than one outstanding
blocking call per thread.
