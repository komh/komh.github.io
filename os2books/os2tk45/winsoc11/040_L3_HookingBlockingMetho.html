<H1>Hooking Blocking Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 42 -->
<P>
As noted in <A HREF="035_L3_BlockingNonblocking&.html">Blocking/Non blocking
&amp; Data Volatility</A>, Windows Sockets implements blocking operations
in such a way that Windows message processing can continue, which may result
in the application which issued the call receiving a Windows message.  In
certain situations an application may want to influence or change the way
in which this pseudo-blocking process is implemented.  The <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()
</A>provides the ability to substitute a named routine which the Windows
Sockets implementation is to use when relinquishing the processor during
a "blocking" operation.
