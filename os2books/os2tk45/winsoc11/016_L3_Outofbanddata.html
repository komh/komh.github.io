<H1>Out-of-band data</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
Note: The following discussion of out-of-band data, also referred to as
TCP Urgent data,  follows the model used in the Berkeley software distribution.
Users and implementors should be aware of the fact that there are at present
two conflicting interpretations of RFC 793 (in which the concept is introduced),
and that the implementation of out-of-band data in the Berkeley Software
Distribution does not conform to the Host Requirements laid down in RFC
1122.  To minimize interoperability problems, applications writers are advised
not to use out-of-band data unless this is required in order to interoperate
with an existing service.  Windows Sockets suppliers are urged to document
the out-of-band semantics (BSD or RFC 1122) which their product implements.
 It is beyond the scope of this specification to mandate a particular set
of semantics for out-of-band data handling.
<P>
The stream socket abstraction includes the notion of "out of band" data.
Out-of-band data is a logically independent transmission channel associated
with each pair of connected stream sockets.  Out-of-band data is delivered
to the user independently of normal data.  The abstraction defines that
the out-of-band data facilities must support the reliable delivery of at
least one out-of-band message at a time.  This message may contain at least
one byte of data, and at least one message may be pending delivery to the
user at any one time.  For communications protocols which support only in-band
signaling (i.e. the urgent data is delivered in sequence with the normal
data), the system normally extracts the data from the normal data stream
and stores it separately.  This allows users to choose between receiving
the urgent data in order and receiving it out of sequence without having
to buffer all the intervening data.  It is possible to "peek" at out-of-band
data.
<P>
An application may prefer to process out-of-band data "in-line", as part
of the normal data stream.  This is achieved by setting the socket option
SO_OOBINLINE (see <A HREF="067_L3_setsockopt.html">setsockopt()</A>). In
this case, the application may wish to determine whether any of the unread
data is "urgent" (the term usually applied to in-line out-of-band data).
 To facilitate this, the Windows Sockets implementation will maintain a
logical "mark" in the data stream to indicate the point at which the out-of-band
data was sent.  An application can use the SIOCATMARK <A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket()
</A>command to determine whether there is any unread data preceding the
mark.  For example, it might use this to resynchronize with its peer by
ensuring that all data up to the mark in the data stream is discarded when
appropriate.
<P>
The <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()</A> routine is
particularly well suited to handling notification of the presence of out-of-band-data.
