<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function is used to determine the status of one or more sockets.  For
each socket, the caller may request information on read, write or error
status.  The set of sockets for which a given status is requested is indicated
by an fd_set structure.  Upon return, the structure is updated to reflect
the subset of these sockets which meet the specified condition, and<B> select()
</B>returns the number of sockets meeting the conditions.  A set of macros
is provided for manipulating an fd_set.  These macros are compatible with
those used in the Berkeley software, but the underlying representation is
completely different.
<P>
The parameter<I> readfds</I> identifies those sockets which are to be checked
for readability.  If the socket is currently <A HREF="059_L3_listen.html">listen()</A>ing,
it will be marked as readable if an incoming connection request has been
received, so that an <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A> is guaranteed
to complete without blocking.  For other sockets, readability means that
queued data is available for reading or,  for sockets of type SOCK_STREAM,
that the virtual socket corresponding to the socket has been closed, so
that a <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A> or <A HREF="063_L3_recvfrom.html">recvfrom()
</A>is guaranteed to complete without blocking.  If the virtual circuit
was closed gracefully, then a <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A> will
return immediately with 0 bytes read; if the virtual circuit was closed
abortively, then a <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A> will complete immediately
with the error code WSAECONNRESET.  The presence of out-of-band data will
be checked if the socket option SO_OOBINLINE has been enabled (see <A HREF="067_L3_setsockopt.html">setsockopt()</A>).

<P>
The parameter<I> writefds</I> identifies those sockets which are to be checked
for writeability.  If a socket is <A HREF="050_L3_connect.html">connect()</A>ing
(non-blocking), writeability means that the connection establishment is
complete.  For other sockets, writeability means that a <A HREF="065_L3_send.html">send()
</A>or <A HREF="066_L3_sendto.html">sendto()</A> will complete without blocking.
 íIt is not specified how long this guarantee can be assumed to be valid,
particularly in a multithreaded environment.ù
<P>
The parameter<I> exceptfds</I> identifies those sockets which are to be
checked for the presence of out-of-band data or any exceptional error conditions.
 Note that out-of-band data will only be reported in this way if the option
SO_OOBINLINE is FALSE.  For a SOCK_STREAM, the breaking of the connection
by the peer or due to KEEPALIVE failure will be indicated as an exception.
 This specification does not define which other errors will be included.
 If a socket is<B> connect()</B>ing (non-blocking), failure of the connect
attempt is indicated in<I> exceptfds.</I>
<P>
Any of<I> readfds</I>,<I> writefds</I>, or<I> exceptfds</I> may be given
as NULL if no descriptors are of interest.  Four macros are defined in the
header file<B> winsock.h</B> for manipulating the descriptor sets.  The
variable FD_SETSIZE determines the maximum number of descriptors in a set.
 (The default value of FD_SETSIZE is 64, which may be modified by #defining
FD_SETSIZE to another value before #including<B> winsock.h</B>.)  Internally,
an fd_set is represented as an array of SOCKETs; the last valid entry is
followed by an element set to INVALID_SOCKET. The macros are:

<UL> Initializes
the<I> set</I> to the NULL set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The parameter<I> timeout</I> controls how long the<B> select()</B> may take
to complete.  If<I> timeout</I> is a null pointer,<B> select()</B> will
block indefinitely until at least one descriptor meets the specified criteria.
Otherwise,<I> timeout</I> points to a struct timeval which specifies the
maximum time that<B> select()</B> should wait before returning.  If the
timeval is initialized to {0, 0},<B> select()</B> will return immediately;
this is used to "poll" the state of the selected sockets.  If this is the
case, then the<B> select()</B> call is considered nonblocking and the standard
assumptions for nonblocking calls apply.  For example, the blocking hook
must not be called, and the Windows Sockets implementation must not yield.

<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
<B>select()</B> returns the total number of descriptors which are ready
and contained in the fd_set structures, or 0 if the time limit expired,
or SOCKET_ERROR if an error occurred.  If the return value is SOCKET_ERROR,
<A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A> may be used
