<H1>socket data type and error values</H1><!-- entering slot 23 -->
<P>
A new data type, SOCKET, has been defined.  The definition of this type
was necessary for future enhancements to the Windows Sockets specification,
such as being able to use sockets as file handles in Windows NT.  Definition
of this type also facilitates porting of applications to a Win/32 environment,
as the type will automatically be promoted from 16 to 32 bits.
<P>
In UNIX, all handles, including socket handles, are small, non-negative
intergers, and some applications make assumptions that this will be true.
Windows Sockets handles have no restrictions, other than that the value
INVALID_SOCKET is not a valid socket.  Socket handles may take any value
in the range 0 to INVALID_SOCKET-1.
<P>
Because the SOCKET type is unsigned, compiling existing source code from,
for example, a UNIX environment may lead to compiler warnings about signed/unsigned
data type mismatches.
<P>
This means, for example, that checking for errors when the <A HREF="069_L3_socket.html">socket()
</A>and <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A> routines return should
not be done by comparing the return value with -1, or seeing if the value
is negative (both common, and legal, approaches in BSD).  Instead, an application
should use the manifest constant INVALID_SOCKET as defined in <A HREF="100_L3_WindowsSocketsHeader.html">winsock.h</A>.
For example:
<P>
<B>TYPICAL BSD STYLE:</B>
<PRE>s = socket(...);
if (s == -1)    /* or s &lt; 0 */
        {...}
</PRE>

<P>
<B>PREFERRED STYLE:</B>
<PRE>s = socket(...);
if (s == INVALID_SOCKET)
        {...}
</PRE>
