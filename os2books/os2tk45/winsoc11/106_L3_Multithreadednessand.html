<H1>Multithreadedness and blocking routines.</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
Data areas returned by, for example, the <A HREF="036_L2_DatabaseFunctions.html">getXbyY()
</A>routines MUST be on a per thread basis.
<P>
Note that an application MUST be prevented from making multiple nested Windows
Sockets function calls.  Only one outstanding function call will be allowed
for a particular task.  Any Windows Sockets call performed when an existing
blocking call is already outstanding will fail with an error code of WSAEINPROGRESS.
 There are two exceptions to this restriction: <A HREF="087_L3_WSACancelBlockingCal.html">WSACancelBlockingCall()
</A>and <A HREF="090_L3_WSAIsBlocking.html">WSAIsBlocking()</A> may be called
at any time.  Windows Sockets suppliers should note that although preliminary
drafts of this specification indicated that the restriction only applied
to blocking function calls, and that it would be permissible to make non-blocking
calls while a blocking call was in progress, this is no longer true.
<P>
Regarding the implementation of blocking routines, the solution in Windows
Sockets is to simulate the blocking mechanism by having each routine call
PeekMessage() as it waits for the completion of its operation.  In anticipation
of this, the function <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()
</A>is provided to allow the programmer to define a special routine to be
called instead of the default PeekMessage() loop.  The blocking hook functions
are discussed in more detail in <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()</A>.
