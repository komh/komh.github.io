<H1>Blocking/Non blocking & Data Volatility</H1><!-- entering slot 36 -->
<P>
One major issue in porting applications from a Berkeley sockets environment
to a Windows environment involves "blocking"; that is, invoking a function
which does not return until the associated operation is completed.  The
problem arises when the operation may take an arbitrarily long time to complete:
an obvious example is a <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A> which may
block until data has been received from the peer system.  The default behavior
within the Berkeley sockets model is for a socket to operate in a blocking
mode unless the programmer explicitly requests that operations be treated
as non-blocking. <B><I> It is strongly recommended that programmers use
the nonblocking (asynchronous) operations if at all possible, as they work
significantly better within the nonpreemptive Windows environment.  Use
blocking operations only if absolutely necessary, and carefully read and
understand this section if you must use blocking operations.</B></I>
<P>
Even on a blocking socket, some operations (e.g. <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A>,
<A HREF="053_L3_getsockopt.html">getsockopt()</A>, <A HREF="051_L3_getpeername.html">getpeername()</A>)
can be completed immediately.  For such operations there is no difference
between blocking and non-blocking operation.  Other operations (e.g. <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A>)
may be completed immediately or may take an arbitrary time to complete,
depending on various transport conditions.  When applied to a blocking socket,
these operations are referred to as blocking operations.  All routines which
can block are listed with an asterisk in the tables above and below.
<P>
Within a Windows Sockets implementation, a blocking operation which cannot
be completed immediately is handled as follows.  The DLL initiates the operation,
and then enters a loop in which it dispatches any Windows messages (yielding
the processor to another thread if necessary) and then checks for the completion
of the Windows Sockets function.  If the function has completed, or if <A HREF="087_L3_WSACancelBlockingCal.html">WSACancelBlockingCall()
</A>has been invoked, the blocking function completes with an appropriate
result. Refer to <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()</A>,
for a complete description of this mechanism, including pseudocode for the
various functions.
<P>
If a Windows message is received for a process for which a blocking operation
is in progress, there is a risk that the application will attempt to issue
another Windows Sockets call.  Because of the difficulty of managing this
condition safely, the Windows Sockets specification does not support such
application behavior.  Two functions are provided to assist the programmer
in this situation. <A HREF="090_L3_WSAIsBlocking.html">WSAIsBlocking()</A> may
be called to determine whether or not a blocking Windows Sockets call is
in progress. <A HREF="087_L3_WSACancelBlockingCal.html">WSACancelBlockingCall()
</A>may be called to cancel an in-progress blocking call, if any. <B> Any
other Windows Sockets function which is called in this situation will fail
with the error WSAEINPROGRESS.</B>  It should be emphasized that this restriction
applies to both blocking and non-blocking operations.
<P>
Although this mechanism is sufficient for simple applications, it cannot
support the complex message-dispatching requirements of more advanced applications
(for example, those using the MDI model).  For such applications, the Windows
Sockets API includes the function <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()</A>,
which allows the programmer to define a special routine which will be called
instead of the default message dispatch routine described above.
<P>
The Windows Sockets DLL will call the blocking hook function only if all
of the following are true: the routine is one which is defined as being
able to block, the specified socket is a blocking socket, and the request
cannot be completed immediately.  (A socket is set to blocking by default,
but the IOCTL FIONBIO and <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()
</A>both set a socket to nonblocking mode.)  If an application uses only
non-blocking sockets and uses the <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()
</A>and/or the <A HREF="036_L2_DatabaseFunctions.html"><!-- entering slot 37 -->WSAAsyncGetXByY()
</A>routines instead of <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()</A> and the
<A HREF="036_L2_DatabaseFunctions.html">getXbyY()</A> routines, then the
blocking hook will never be called and the application does not need to
be concerned with the reentrancy issues the blocking hook can introduce.

<P>
If an application invokes an asynchronous or non-blocking operation which
takes a pointer to a memory object (e.g. a buffer, or a global variable)
as an argument, it is the responsibility of the application to ensure that
the object is available to the Windows Sockets implementation throughout
the operation. The application must not invoke any Windows function which
might affect the mapping or addressability of the memory involved.  In a
multithreaded system, the application is also responsible for coordinating
access to the object using appropriate synchronization mechanisms.  A Windows
Sockets implementation cannot, and will not, address these issues.  The
possible consequences of failing to observe these rules are beyond the scope
of this specification.
