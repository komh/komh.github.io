<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function is used to read incoming data on a (possibly connected) socket
and capture the address from which the data was sent.
<P>
For sockets of type SOCK_STREAM, as much information as is currently available
up to the size of the buffer supplied is returned.  If the socket has been
configured for in-line reception of out-of-band data (socket option SO_OOBINLINE)
and out-of-band data is unread, only out-of-band data will be returned.
 The application may use the <A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket()
</A>SIOCATMARK to determine whether any more out-of-band data remains to
be read. The<I> from</I> and<I> fromlen</I> parameters are ignored for SOCK_STREAM
sockets.
<P>
For datagram sockets, data is extracted from the first enqueued datagram,
up to the size of the size of the buffer supplied.  If the datagram is larger
than the buffer supplied, the buffer is filled with the first part of the
message, the excess data is lost, and<B> recvfrom()</B> returns the error
code WSAEMSGSIZE. If<I> from</I> is non-zero, and the socket is of type
SOCK_DGRAM, the network address of the peer which sent the data is copied
to the corresponding struct sockaddr.  The value pointed to by<I> fromlen
</I>is initialized to the size of this structure, and is modified on return
to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
<P>
If no incoming data is available at the socket, the<B> recvfrom()</B> call
waits for data to arrive unless the socket is non-blocking.  In this case
a value of SOCKET_ERROR is returned with the error code set to WSAEWOULDBLOCK.
The <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()</A> or <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()
</A>calls may be used to determine when more data arrives. If the socket
is of type SOCK_STREAM and the remote side has shut down the connection
gracefully, a<B> recvfrom()</B> will complete immediately with 0 bytes received.
 If the connection has been abortively disconnected, a<B> recvfrom()</B> will
fail with the error WSAECONNRESET.
<P>
<I>Flags</I> may be used to influence the behavior of the function invocation
beyond the options specified for the associated socket.  That is, the semantics
of this function are determined by the socket options and the<I> flags</I> parameter.
 The latter is constructed by or-ing any of the following values:

<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
If no error occurs,<B> recvfrom()</B> returns the number of bytes received.
 If the connection has been closed, it returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of
SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error code may be retrieved by
calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.
