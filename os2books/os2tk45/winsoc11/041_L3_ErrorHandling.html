<P>
For compatibility with thread-based environments, details of API errors
are obtained through the <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()
</A>API.  Although the accepted "Berkeley-Style" mechanism for obtaining
socket-based network errors is via "errno", this mechanism cannot guarantee
the integrity of an error ID in a multi-threaded environment. <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()
</A>allows you to retrieve an error code on a per thread basis.
<P>
<A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A> returns error
codes which avoid conflict with standard Microsoft C error codes. Certain
error codes returned by certain Windows Sockets routines fall into the standard
range of error codes as defined by Microsoft C.  If you are NOT using an
application development environment which defines error codes consistent
with Microsoft C, you are advised to use the Windows Sockets error codes
prefixed by "WSA" to ensure accurate error code detection.
<P>
Note that this specification defines a recommended set of error codes, and
lists the possible errors which may be returned as a result of each function.
It may be the case in some implementations that other Windows Sockets error
codes will be returned in addition to those listed, and applications should
be prepared to handle errors other than those enumerated under each API
description.  However a Windows Sockets implementation must not return any
value which is not enumerated in the table of legal Windows Sockets errors
given in <A HREF="097_L3_ErrorCodes.html">Error Codes</A>.
