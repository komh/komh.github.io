<H1>Windows Sockets Stack Installation Checking</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
To detect the presence of one (or many) Windows Sockets implementations
on a system, an application which has been linked with the Windows Sockets
Import Library may simply call the <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>routine.  If an application wishes to be a little more sophisticated
it can examine the $PATH environment variable and search for instances of
Windows Sockets implementations (WINSOCK.DLL).  For each instance it can
issue a<B> LoadLibrary()</B> call and use the <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>routine to discover implementation specific data.
<P>
This version of the Windows Sockets specification does not attempt to address
explicitly the issue of multiple concurrent Windows Sockets implementations.
Nothing in the specification should be interpreted as restricting multiple
Windows Sockets DLLs from being present and used concurrently by one or
more Windows Sockets applications.
<P>
For further details of where to obtain Windows Sockets components, see "<A HREF="103_L3_WindowsSocketsCompon.html">Windows
Sockets Components</A>".
