<H1>Windows Sockets in Multithreaded Versions of Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 33 -->
<P>
The Windows Sockets interface is designed to work for both single-threaded
versions of Windows (such as Windows 3.1) and future multithreaded versions
of Windows (such as Windows NT).  In a multithreaded environment the sockets
interface is basically the same, but the author of a multithreaded application
must be aware that it is the responsibility of the application, not the
Windows Sockets implementation, to synchronize access to a socket between
threads. This is the same rule as applies to other forms of I/O such as
file I/O. Failure to synchronize calls on a socket leads to unpredictable
results; for example if there are two simultaneous calls to send(), there
is no guarantee as to the order in which the data will be sent.
<P>
Closing a socket in one thread that has an outstanding blocking call on
the same socket in another thread will cause the blocking call to fail with
WSAEINTR, just as if the operation were cancelled.  This also applies if
there is a <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()</A> call outstanding and
the application closes one of the sockets being selected.
<P>
There is no default blocking hook installed in preemptive multithreaded
versions of Windows.  This is because the machine will not be blocked if
a single application is waiting for an operation to complete and hence not
calling PeekMessage() or GetMessage() which cause the application to yield
in nonpremptive Windows.  However, for backwards compatibility the WSASetBlockingHook()
call is implemented in multithreaded versions of Windows, and any application
whose behavior depends on the default blocking hook may install their own
blocking hook which duplicates the default hook's semantics, if desired.
