The following is a list of possible error codes returned by the <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()
</A>call, along with their explanations.  The error numbers are consistently
set across all Windows Sockets-compliant implementations.

<P>
The first set of definitions is present to resolve contentions between standard
C error codes which may be defined inconsistently between various C compilers.

<P>
The second set of definitions provides Windows Sockets versions of regular
Berkeley Sockets error codes.
<P>
The third set of definitions consists of extended Windows Sockets-specific
error codes.
<P>
The fourth set of<!-- entering slot 122 --> errors are returned by Windows
Sockets <A HREF="036_L2_DatabaseFunctions.html">getXbyY()</A> and<B> WSAAsyncGetXByY()
</B>functions, and correspond to the errors which in Berkeley software would
be returned in the<I> h_errno</I> variable.  They correspond to various
failures which may be returned by the Domain Name Service.  If the Windows
Sockets implementation  does not use the DNS, it will use the most appropriate
code.  In general, a Windows Sockets application should interpret WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND
and WSANO_DATA as indicating that the key (name, address, etc.) was not
found,, while WSATRY_AGAIN and WSANO_RECOVERY suggest that the name service
itself is non-operational.
<P>
The error numbers are derived from the <A HREF="100_L3_WindowsSocketsHeader.html">winsock.h
</A>header file, and are based on the fact that Windows Sockets error numbers
are computed by adding 10000 to the "normal" Berkeley error number.
<P>
Note that this table does not include all of the error codes defined in
<B>winsock.h</B>.  This is because it includes only errors which might reasonably
be returned by a Windows Sockets implementation:<B> winsock.h</B>, on the
other hand, includes a full set of BSD definitions to ensure compatibility
with ported software.
