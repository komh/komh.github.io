<P>
The basic building block for communication is the socket.  A socket is an
endpoint of communication to which a name may be bound.  Each socket in
use has a type and an associated process.  Sockets exist within communication
domains. A communication domain is an abstraction introduced to bundle common
properties of threads communicating through sockets.  Sockets normally exchange
data only with sockets in the same domain (it may be possible to cross domain
boundaries, but only if some translation process is performed).  The Windows
Sockets facilities support a single communication domain: the Internet domain,
which is used by processes which communicate using the Internet Protocol
Suite.  (Future versions of this specification may include additional domains.)

<P>
Sockets are typed according to the communication properties visible to a
user. Applications are presumed to communicate only between sockets of the
same type, although there is nothing that prevents communication between
sockets of different types should the underlying communication protocols
support this.
<P>
Two types of sockets currently are available to a user.  A stream socket
provides for the bi-directional, reliable, sequenced, and unduplicated flow
of data without record boundaries.
<P>
A datagram socket supports bi-directional flow of data which is not promised
to be sequenced, reliable, or unduplicated.  That is, a process receiving
messages on a datagram socket may find messages duplicated, and, possibly,
in an order different from the order in which it was sent.  An important
characteristic of a datagram socket is that record boundaries in data are
preserved.  Datagram sockets closely model the facilities found in many
contemporary packet switched networks such as Ethernet.
