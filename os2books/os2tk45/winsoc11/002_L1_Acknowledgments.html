<P>
The authors would like to thank their companies for allowing them the time
and resources to make this specification possible:  JSB Corporation, Microdyne
Corporation, FTP Software, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft Corporation.

<P>
Special thanks should also be extended to the other efforts contributing
to the success of Windows Sockets. The original draft was heavily influenced
by existing specifications offered and detailed by JSB Corporation and NetManage,
Inc. The "version 1.0 debate" hosted by Microsoft in Seattle allowed many
of the members of the working group to hash out final details for 1.0 vis-a-vis.

<P>
Sun Microsystems was kind enough to allow first time implementors to "plug
and play" beta software during the first Windows Sock-A-Thon of  Windows
Sockets applications and implementations at Interop Fall '92.  Microsoft
has shared WSAT (the Windows Sockets API Tester) with other Windows Sockets
implementors as a standard Windows Sockets test suite to aid in testing
their implementations. Finally, Sun Microsystems and FTP Software plan to
host the Windows Sock-A-Thon II in Boston February '93.
<P>
Without the contributions of the individuals and corporations involved in
the working group, Windows Sockets would never have been as thoroughly reviewed
and completed as quickly. In just one year, several competitors in the networking
business developed a useful specification with something to show for it]
Many thanks to all which participated, either in person or on e-mail to
the Windows Sockets effort. The authors would like to thank everyone who
participated in any way, and apologize in advance for anyone we have omitted.
