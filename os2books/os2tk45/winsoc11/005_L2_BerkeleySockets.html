<P>
The Windows Sockets Specification has been built upon the Berkeley Sockets
programming model which is the de facto standard for TCP/IP networking.
 It is intended to provide a high degree of familiarity for programmers
who are used to programming with sockets in UNIX and other environments,
and to simplify the task of porting existing sockets-based source code.
 The Windows Sockets API is consistent with release 4.3 of the Berkeley
Software Distribution (4.3BSD).
