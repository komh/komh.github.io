<H1>Windows Sockets Version 1.1</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
Windows Sockets Version 1.1 follows the guidelines and structure laid out
by version 1.0, making changes only where absolutely necessary as indicated
by the experiences of a number of companies that created Windows Sockets
implementations based on the version 1.0 specification.  Version 1.1 contains
several clarifications and minor fixes to version 1.0.  Additionally, the
following more significant changes were incorporated into version 1.1:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inclusion of the <A HREF="073_L3_gethostname.html">gethostname()
</A>routine to simplify retrieval of the host's name and address.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Definition of DLL ordinal values below 1000 as reserved
for Windows Sockets and ordinals above 1000 as unrestricted.  This allows
Windows Sockets vendors to include private interfaces to their DLLs without
risking that the ordinals choosen will conflict with a future version of
Windows Sockets.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Addition of a reference count to <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>and <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A>, requiring correspondences
between the calls.  This allows applications and third-party DLLs to make
use of a Windows Sockets implementation without being concerned about the
calls to these APIs made by the other.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Change of return type of <A HREF="056_L3_inet_addr.html">inet_addr()
</A>from<B> struct in_addr</B> to<B> unsigned long</B>.  This was required
due to different handling of four-byte structure returns between the Microsoft
and Borland C compilers.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Change of <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()
</A>semantics from "edge-triggerred" to "level-triggerred".  The level-triggerred
semantics significantly simplify an application's use of this routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Change the <A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket()
</A>FIONBIO semantics to fail if a <A HREF="085_L3_WSAAsyncSelect.html">WSAAsyncSelect()
</A>call is outstanding on the socket.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Addition of the TCP_NODELAY socket option for RFC
1122 conformance.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
