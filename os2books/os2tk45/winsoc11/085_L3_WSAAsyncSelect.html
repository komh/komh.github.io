<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function is used to request that the Windows Sockets DLL should send
a message to the window<I> hWnd</I> whenever it detects any of the network
events specified by the<I> lEvent</I> parameter.  The message which should
be sent is specified by the<I> wMsg</I> parameter.  The socket for which
notification is required is identified by<I> s</I>.  The<I> lEvent</I> parameter
is constructed by or'ing any of the values specified in the following list.

</UL>
<P>
Issuing a<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> for a socket cancels any previous<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>for the same socket.  For example, to receive notification for both
reading and writing, the application must call<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> with
both FD_READ and FD_WRITE, as follows:
<P>

<PRE>rc = WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, wMsg, FD_READ!FD_WRITE);</PRE>

<P>
It is not possible to specify different messages for different events.  The
following code will<B> not</B> work; the second call will cancel the effects
of the first, and only FD_WRITE events will be reported with message wMsg2:

<P>

<PRE>rc = WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, wMsg1, FD_READ);
rc = WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, wMsg2, FD_WRITE);
</PRE>

<P>
To cancel all notification -- i.e., to indicate that the Windows Sockets
implementation should send no further messages related to network events
on the socket --<I> lEvent</I> should be set to zero.
<P>

<PRE>rc = WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, 0, 0);
</PRE>

<P>
Although in this instance<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> immediately disables event
message posting for the socket, it is possible that messages may be waiting
in the application's message queue.  The application must therefore be prepared
to receive network event messages even after cancellation.  Closing a socket
with <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A> also cancels<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>message sending, but the same caveat about messages in the queue prior
to the <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A> still applies.

<P>
Since an <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A><B>'</B>ed socket has
the same properties as the listening socket used to accept it, any<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>events set for the listening socket apply to the accepted socket.  For
example, if a listening socket has<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> events FD_ACCEPT,
FD_READ, and FD_WRITE, then any socket accepted on that listening socket
will also have FD_ACCEPT, FD_READ, and FD_WRITE events with the same<I> wMsg
</I>value used for messages.  If a different<I> wMsg</I> or events are desired,
the application should call<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B>, passing the accepted
socket and the desired new information.
<P>
φNote: There is a timing window between the <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()
</A>call and the call to<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> to change the events or
<I>wMsg</I>.  An application which desires a different<I> wMsg</I> for the
listening and <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A>'ed sockets should
ask for only FD_ACCEPT events on the listening socket, then set appropriate
events after the <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A>. Since FD_ACCEPT
is never sent for a connected socket and FD_READ, FD_WRITE, FD_OOB, and
FD_CLOSE are never sent for listening sockets, this will not impose difficulties.∙

<P>
When one of the nominated network events occurs on the specified socket
<I>s</I>, the application's window<I> hWnd</I> receives message<I> wMsg</I>.
The<I> wParam</I> argument identifies the socket on which a network event
has occurred.  The low word of<I> lParam</I> specifies the network event
that has occurred.  The high word of<I> lParam</I> contains any error code.
 The error code be any error as defined in<B> winsock.h</B>.
<P>
The error and event codes may be extracted from the<I> lParam</I> using
the macros WSAGETSELECTERROR and WSAGETSELECTEVENT, defined in<B> winsock.h
</B>as:
<P>

<PRE>#define WSAGETSELECTERROR(lParam)            HIWORD(lParam)
#define WSAGETSELECTEVENT(lParam)            LOWORD(lParam)
</PRE>

<P>
The use of these macros will maximize the portability of the source code
for the application.
<P>
The possible network event codes which may be returned are as follows:

<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
The return value is 0 if the application's declaration of interest in the
network event set was successful.  Otherwise the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned,
and a specific error number may be retrieved by calling<B> WSAGetLastError()</B>.

<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
Although<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> can be called with interest in multiple
events, the application window will receive a single message for each network
event. As in the case of the<B> select()</B> function,<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>will frequently be used to determine when a data transfer operation
(<B>send()</B> or<B> recv()</B>) can be issued with the expectation of immediate
success. Nevertheless, a robust application must be prepared for the possibility
that it may receive a message and issue a Windows Sockets API call which
returns WSAEWOULDBLOCK immediately.  For example, the following sequence
of events is possible:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->data arrives on socket<B> s</B>; Windows Sockets
posts<B> WSAAsyncSelect</B> message<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->application processes some other message<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->while processing, application issues an <A HREF="058_L3_ioctlsocket.html">ioctlsocket(s,
FIONREAD...)</A> and notices that there is data ready to be read<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->application issues a <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv(s,...)
</A>to read the data<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->application loops to process next message, eventually
reaching the<B> WSAAsyncSelect</B> message indicating that data is ready
to read<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->application issues <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv(s,...)</A>,
which fails with the error WSAEWOULDBLOCK.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Other sequences are possible.
<P>
The Windows Sockets DLL will not continually flood an application with messages
for a particular network event.  Having successfully posted notification
of a particular event to an application window, no further message(s) for
that network event will be posted to the application window until the application
makes the function call which implicitly re-enables notification of that
network event.

<UL>NONE<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any call to the reenabling routine, even one which fails, results in reenabling
of message posting for the relevent event.
<P>
For FD_READ, FD_OOB, and FD_ACCEPT events, message posting is "level-triggerred."
 This means that if the reenabling routine is called and the relevent event
is still valid after the call, a<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> message is posted
to the application.  This allows an application to be event-driven and not
concern itself with the amount of data that arrives at any one time.  Consider
the following sequence:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Windows Sockets DLL receives 100 bytes of data
on socket<B> s</B> and posts an FD_READ message.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The application issues<B> recv( s, buffptr, 50,
0)</B> to read 50 bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Windows Sockets DLL posts another FD_READ
message since there is still data to be read.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
With these semantics, an application need not read all available data in
response to an FD_READ message--a single <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()
</A>in response to each FD_READ message is appropriate.  If an application
issues multiple <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()</A> calls in response
to a single FD_READ, it may receive multiple FD_READ messages.  Such an
application may wish to disable FD_READ messages before starting the <A HREF="062_L3_recv.html">recv()
</A>calls by calling<B> WSAAsyncSelect()</B> with the FD_READ event not
set.
<P>
If an event is true when the application initially calls<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>or when the reenabling function is called, then a message is posted
as appropriate.  For example, if an application calls <A HREF="059_L3_listen.html">listen()</A>,
a connect attempt is made, then the application calls<B> WSAAsyncSelect()
</B>specifying that it wants to receive FD_ACCEPT messages for the socket,
the Windows Sockets implementation posts an FD_ACCEPT message immediately.

<P>
The FD_WRITE event is handled slightly differently.  An FD_WRITE message
is posted when a socket is first connected with <A HREF="050_L3_connect.html">connect()
</A>or accepted with <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A>, and then
after a <A HREF="065_L3_send.html">send()</A> or <A HREF="066_L3_sendto.html">sendto()
</A>fails with WSAEWOULDBLOCK and buffer space becomes available.  Therefore,
an application can assume that<!-- entering slot 105 --> sends are possible
starting from the first FD_WRITE message and lasting until a send returns
WSAEWOULDBLOCK.  After such a failure the application will be notified that
sends are again possible with an FD_WRITE message.
<P>
The FD_OOB event is used only when a socket is configured to receive out-of-band
data separately.  If the socket is configured to receive out-of-band data
in-line, the out-of-band (expedited) data is treated as normal data and
the application should register an interest in, and will  receive, FD_READ
events, not FD_OOB events.  An application may set or inspect the way in
which out-of-band data is to be handled by using <A HREF="067_L3_setsockopt.html">setsockopt()
</A>or <A HREF="053_L3_getsockopt.html">getsockopt</A> for the SO_OOBINLINE
option.
<P>
The error code in an FD_CLOSE message indicates whether the socket close
was graceful or abortive.  If the error code is 0, then the close was graceful;
if the error code is WSAECONNRESET, then the socket's virtual socket was
abortively disconnected.  This only applies to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM.

<P>
The FD_CLOSE message is posted when a close indication is received for the
virtual circuit corresponding to the socket.  In TCP terms, this means that
the FD_CLOSE is posted when the connection goes into the FIN WAIT or CLOSE
WAIT states.  This results from the remote end performing a <A HREF="068_L3_shutdown.html">shutdown()
</A>on the send side or a <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A>.

<P>
Please note your application will receive ONLY an FD_CLOSE message to indicate
closure of a virtual circuit. It will NOT receive an FD_READ message to
indicate this condition.

<B>Notes For Windows Sockets Suppliers</B>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the Windows Sockets Supplier to ensure that
messages are<!-- entering slot 106 --> successfully posted to the application.
 If a<B> PostMessage()</B> operation fails, the Windows Sockets implementation
<B>must</B> re-post that message as long as the window exists.
<P>
Windows Sockets suppliers should use the WSAMAKESELECTREPLY macro when constructing
the<I> lParam</I> in the message. When a socket is closed, the Windows Sockets
Supplier should purge any messages remaining for posting to the application
window.  However the application must be prepared to receive, and discard,
any messages which may have been posted prior to the <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A>.
