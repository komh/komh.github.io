<H1>Error codes -- errno, h_errno & WSAGetLastError()</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
Error codes set by the Windows Sockets implementation are<B> NOT</B> made
available via the errno variable.  Additionally, for the <A HREF="036_L2_DatabaseFunctions.html">getXbyY()
</A>class of functions, error codes are<B> NOT</B> made available via the
h_errno variable.  Instead, error codes are accessed by using the <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()
</A>API.  This function is provided in Windows Sockets as a precursor (and
eventually an alias) for the Win32 function<B> GetLastError()</B>.  This
is intended to provide a reliable way for a thread in a multi-threaded process
to obtain per-thread error information.
<P>
For compatibility with BSD, an application may choose to include a line
of the form:
<PRE>#define errno WSAGetLastError()
</PRE>

<P>
This will allow networking code which was written to use the global errno
to work correctly in a single-threaded environment.  There are, obviously,
some drawbacks.  If a source file includes code which inspects errno for
both socket and non-socket functions, this mechanism cannot be used.  Furthermore,
it is not possible for an application to assign a new value to errno.  (In
Windows Sockets the function <A HREF="092_L3_WSASetLastError.html">WSASetLastError()
</A>may be used for this purpose.)
<P>
<B>TYPICAL BSD STYLE:</B>
<PRE>r = recv(...);
if (r == -1
    &amp;&amp; errno == EWOULDBLOCK)
        {...}
</PRE>

<P>
<B>PREFERRED STYLE:</B>
<PRE>r = recv(...);
if (r == -1       /* (but see below) */
    &amp;&amp; WSAGetLastError() == EWOULDBLOCK)
        {...}
</PRE>

<P>
Although error constants consistent with 4.3 Berkeley Sockets are provided
for compatibility purposes, applications should, where possible, use the
"WSA" error code definitions.  For example, a more accurate version of the
above source code fragment is:
<PRE>r = recv(...);
if (r == -1
    &amp;&amp; WSAGetLastError() == WSAEWOULDBLOCK)
        {...}
</PRE>
