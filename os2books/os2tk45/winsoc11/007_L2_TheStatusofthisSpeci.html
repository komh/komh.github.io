<H1>The Status of this Specification</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
Windows Sockets is an independent specification which was created and exists
for the benefit of application developers and network vendors and, indirectly,
computer users. Each published (non-draft) version of this specification
represents a fully workable API for implementation by network vendors and
programming use by application developers. Discussion of this specification
and suggested improvements continue and are welcomed. Such discussion occurs
mainly via the Internet electronic mail forum winsock@microdyne.com. Meetings
of interested parties occur on an irregular basis. Details of these meetings
are publicized to the electronic mail forum.
