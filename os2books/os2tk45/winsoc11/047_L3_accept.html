<UL> A descriptor identifying a socket which
is listening for connections after a<B> listen</B>().<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>An optional pointer to a buffer which receives
the address of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer.
 The exact format of the<I> addr</I> argument is determined by the address
family established when the socket was created.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>A optional pointer to an integer which contains
the length of the address<I> addr</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This routine extracts the first connection on the queue of pending connections
on<I> s</I>, creates a new socket with the same properties as<I> s</I> and
returns a handle to the new socket.  If no pending connections are present
on the queue, and the socket is not marked as non-blocking,<B> accept()
</B>blocks the caller until a connection is present.  If the socket is marked
non-blocking and no pending connections are present on the queue,<B> accept()
</B>returns an error as described below.  The accepted socket may not be
used to accept more connections.  The original socket remains open.
<P>
The argument<I> addr</I> is a result parameter that is filled in with the
address of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer.
 The exact format of the<I> addr</I> parameter is determined by the address
family in which the communication is occurring.  The<I> addrlen</I> is a
value-result parameter; it should initially contain the amount of space
pointed to by<I> addr</I>; on return it will contain the actual length (in
bytes) of the address returned.  This call is used with connection-based
socket types such as SOCK_STREAM.  If<I> addr</I> and/or<I> addrlen</I> are
equal to NULL, then no information about the remote address of the accepted
socket is returned.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
If no error occurs,<B> accept</B>() returns a value of type SOCKET which
is a descriptor for the accepted packet.  Otherwise, a value of INVALID_SOCKET
is returned, and a specific error code may be retrieved by calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.

<P>
The integer referred to by<I> addrlen</I> initially contains the amount
of space pointed to by<I> addr</I>.  On return it will contain the actual
length in bytes of the address returned.
