<H1>Maximum number of sockets supported</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
The maximum number of sockets supported by a particular Windows Sockets
supplier is implementation specific.  An application should make no assumptions
about the availability of a certain number of sockets.  This topic is addressed
further in the section on <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()</A>.
However, independent of the number of sockets supported by a particular
implementation is the issue of the maximum number of sockets which an application
can actually make use of.
<P>
The maximum number of sockets which a Windows Sockets application can make
use of is determined at compile time by the manifest constant FD_SETSIZE.
 This value is used in constructing the fd_set structures used in <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()</A>.
The default value in <A HREF="100_L3_WindowsSocketsHeader.html">winsock.h
</A>is 64.  If an application is designed to be capable of working with
more than 64 sockets, the implementor should define the manifest FD_SETSIZE
in every source file before including <A HREF="100_L3_WindowsSocketsHeader.html">winsock.h</A>.
One way of doing this may be to include the definition within the compiler
options in the makefile, for example adding -DFD_SETSIZE=128 as an option
to the compiler command line for Microsoft C.  It must be emphasized that
defining FD_SETSIZE as a particular value has no effect on the actual number
of sockets provided by a Windows Sockets implementation.
