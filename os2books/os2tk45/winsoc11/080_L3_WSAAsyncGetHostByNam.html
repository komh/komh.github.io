by members of the hostent structure.  It is recommended that you supply

<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function is an asynchronous version of<B> gethostbyname()</B>, and
is used to retrieve host name and address information corresponding to a
hostname.  The Windows Sockets implementation initiates the operation and
returns to the caller immediately, passing back an<B> asynchronous task
handle</B> which the application may use to identify the operation.  When
the operation is completed, the results (if any) are copied into the buffer
provided by the caller and a message is sent to the application's window.
 When the asynchronous operation is complete the application's window<I> hWnd
</I>receives message<I> wMsg</I>.  The<I> wParam</I> argument contains the
asynchronous task handle as returned by the original function call.  The
high 16 bits of<I> lParam</I> contain any error code.  The error code may
be any error as defined in<B> winsock.h</B>.  An error code of zero indicates
successful completion of the asynchronous operation.  On successful completion,
the buffer supplied to the original function call contains a hostent structure.
To access the elements of this structure, the original buffer address should
be cast to a hostent structure pointer and accessed as appropriate.
<P>
Note that if the error code is WSAENOBUFS, it indicates that the size of
the buffer specified by<I> buflen</I> in the original call was too small
to contain all the resultant information.  In this case, the low 16 bits
of<I> lParam</I> contain the size of buffer required to supply ALL the requisite
information. If the application decides that the partial data is inadequate,
it may reissue the<B> WSAAsyncGetHostByName()</B> function call with a buffer
large enough to receive all the desired  information (i.e. no smaller than
the low 16 bits of<I> lParam</I>).
<P>
The error code and buffer length should be extracted from the<I> lParam
</I>using the macros  WSAGETASYNCERROR and WSAGETASYNCBUFLEN, defined in
<B>winsock.h</B> as:
<P>

<PRE>#define WSAGETASYNCERROR(lParam)            HIWORD(lParam)#define WSAGETASYNCBUFLEN(lParam)           LOWORD(lParam)
</PRE>

<P>
The use of these macros will maximize the portability of the source code
for the application.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
The return value specifies whether or not the asynchronous operation was
successfully initiated.  Note that it does not imply success or failure
of the operation itself. If the operation was successfully initiated,<B> WSAAsyncGetHostByName()
</B>returns a nonzero value of type HANDLE which is the asynchronous task
handle for the request.  This value can be used in two ways.  It can be
used to cancel the operation using <A HREF="086_L3_WSACancelAsyncReques.html">WSACancelAsyncRequest()</A>.
It can also be used to match up asynchronous operations and completion messages,
by examining the<I> wParam</I> message argument.
<P>
If the asynchronous operation could not be initiated,<B> WSAAsyncGetHostByName()
</B>returns a zero value, and a specific error number may be retrieved by
calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
The buffer supplied to this function is used by the Windows Sockets implementation
to construct a hostent structure together with the contents of data areas
referenced by members of the same hostent structure.  To avoid the WSAENOBUFS
error noted above, the application should provide a buffer of at least MAXGETHOSTSTRUCT
bytes (as defined in<B> winsock.h</B>).
<P>
<B>Notes For Windows Sockets Suppliers</B>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the Windows Sockets implementation to ensure
that messages are successfully posted to the application.  If a<B><!-- entering slot 94 --> PostMessage()
</B>operation fails, the Windows Sockets implementation<B> must</B> re-post
that message as long as the window exists.
<P>
Windows Sockets suppliers should use the WSAMAKEASYNCREPLY macro when constructing
the<I> lParam</I> in the message.
<P>
<B>Error Codes</B>
<P>
The following error codes may be set when an application window receives
a message.  As described above, they may be extracted from the<I> lParam
</I>in the reply message using the WSAGETASYNCERROR macro.
