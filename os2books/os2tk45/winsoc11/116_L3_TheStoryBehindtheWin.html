<H1>The Story Behind the Windows Sockets Icon</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>

<BR>
(by Alistair Banks, Microsoft Corporation)
<P>
We thought we'd do a "Wind Sock" at one stage--but you try to get that into
32x32 bits] It would have had to look wavy and colorful, and... well, it
just didn't work. Also, our graphics designers have "opinions" about the
icons truly representing what they are--people would have thought this was
"The colorful wavy tube specification 1.0]"
<P>
I tried to explain "API" "Programming Interface" to the artist--we ended
up with toolbox icons with little flying windows.
<P>
Then we came to realise that we should be going after the shortened form
of the name, rather the name in full... Windows Sockets... And so we went
for that -- so she drew (now remember I'm English and you're probably American)
"Windows Spanner", a.k.a. a socket wrench.  In the U.S. you'd have been
talking about the "Windows Socket spec" OK, but in England that would have
been translatated as "Windows Spanner Spec 1.0" -- so we went to Electrical
sockets -- well the first ones came out looking like "Windows Pignose Spec
1.0"]]]]
<P>
So how do you use 32x32, get an international electrical socket] You take
the square type (American &amp; English OK, Europe &amp; Australia are too
rounded)--you choose the American one, because it's on the wall in front
of you (and it's more compact (but less safe, IMHO) and then you turn it
upside down, thereby compromising its nationality]
<P>
φIMHO = "In My Humble Opinion"--ed.∙
