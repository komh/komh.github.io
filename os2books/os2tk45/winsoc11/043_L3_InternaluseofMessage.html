<H1>Internal use of Messages by Windows Sockets Implementations</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
In order to implement Windows Sockets purely as a DLL, it may be necessary
for the DLL to post messages internally for communication and timing.  This
is perfectly legal; however, a Windows Sockets DLL must not post messages
to a window handle opened by a client application except for those messages
requested by the application.  A Windows Sockets DLL that needs to use messages
for its own purposes must open a hidden window and post any necessary messages
to the handle for that window.
