<H1>Byte Ordering</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
The Intel byte ordering is like that of the DEC VAX, and therefore differs
from the Internet and 68000-type processor byte ordering.  Thus care must
be taken to ensure correct orientation.
<P>
Any reference to IP addresses or port numbers passed to or from a Windows
Sockets routine must be in network order.  This includes the IP address
and port fields of a<B> struct sockaddr_in</B> (but not the<I> sin_family
</I>field).
<P>
Consider an application which normally contacts a server on the TCP port
corresponding to the "time" service, but which provides a mechanism for
the user to specify that an alternative port is to be used.  The port number
returned by <A HREF="076_L3_getservbyname.html">getservbyname()</A> is already
in network order, which is the format required constructing an address,
so no translation is required.  However if the user elects to use a different
port, entered as an integer, the application must convert this from host
to network order (using the <A HREF="055_L3_htons.html">htons()</A> function)
before using it to construct an address.  Conversely, if the application
wishes to display the number of the port within an address (returned via,
e.g., <A HREF="051_L3_getpeername.html">getpeername()</A>), the port number
must be converted from network to host order (using <A HREF="061_L3_ntohs.html">ntohs()</A>)
before it can be displayed.
<P>
Since the Intel and Internet byte orders are different, the conversions
described above are unavoidable.  Application writers are cautioned that
they should use the standard conversion functions provided as part of the
Windows Sockets API rather than writing their own conversion code, since
future implementations of Windows Sockets are likely to run on systems for
which the host order is identical to the network byte order.  Only applications
which use the standard conversion functions are likely to be portable.
<P>
