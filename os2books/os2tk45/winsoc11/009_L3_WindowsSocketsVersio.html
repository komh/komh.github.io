<P>
Windows Sockets Version 1.0 represented the results of considerable work
within the vendor and user community as discussed in "<A HREF="114_L3_OriginsofWindowsSock.html">Origins
of Windows Sockets</A>". This version of  the specification was released
in order that network software suppliers and  application developers could
begin to construct implementations and applications  which conformed to
the Windows Sockets standard.
