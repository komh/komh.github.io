<H1>Accessing a Windows Sockets DLL from an Intermediate DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
A Windows Sockets DLL may be accessed both directly from an application
and through an "intermediate" DLL.  An example of such an intermediate DLL
would be a virtual network API layer that supports generalized network functionality
for applications and uses Windows Sockets.  Such a DLL could be used by
several applications simultaneously, and the DLL must take special precautions
with respect to the<B> WSAStartup()</B> and<B> WSACleanup()</B> calls to
ensure that these routines are called in the context of each task that will
make Windows Sockets calls.  This is because the Windows Sockets DLL will
need a call to<B> WSAStartup()</B> for each task in order to set up task-specific
data structures, and a call to<B> WSACleanup()</B> to free any resources
allocated for the task.
<P>
There are (at least) two ways to accomplish this.  The simplest method is
for the intermediate DLL to have calls similiar to <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>and <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> that applications
call as appropriate.  The DLL would then call <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>or <A HREF="088_L3_WSACleanup.html">WSACleanup()</A> from within these
routines.  Another mechanism is for the intermediate DLL to build a table
of task handles, which are obtained from the<B> GetCurrentTask()</B> Windows
API, and at each entry point into the intermediate DLL check whether <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>has been called for the current task, then call <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>if necessary.
<P>
If a DLL makes a blocking call and does not install its own blocking hook,
then the DLL author must be aware that control may be returned to the application
either by an application-installed blocking hook or by the default blocking
hook.  Thus, it is possible that the application will cancel the DLL's blocking
operation via <A HREF="087_L3_WSACancelBlockingCal.html">WSACancelBlockingCall()</A>.
If this occurs, the DLL's blocking operation will fail with the error code
WSAEINTR, and the DLL must return control to the calling task as quickly
as possible, as the used has likely pressed a cancel or close button and
the task has requested control of the CPU.  It is recommended that DLLs
which make blocking calls install their own blocking hooks with <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()
</A>to prevent unforeseen interactions between the application and the DLL.

<P>
Note that this is not necessary for DLLs in Windows NT because of its different
process and DLL structure.  Under Windows NT, the intermediate DLL could
simply call <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()</A> in its DLL
initialization routine, which is called whenever a new process which uses
the DLL starts.
