<H1>Private API Interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 46 -->
<P>
The <A HREF="110_L3_DLLOrdinalNumbers.html">winsock.def</A> file lists the
ordinals defined for the Windows Sockets APIs.  In addition to the ordinal
values listed, all ordinals 999 and below are reserved for future Windows
Sockets use.  It may be convenient for a Windows Sockets implementation
to export additional, private interfaces from the Windows Sockets DLL.  This
is perfectly acceptable, as long as the ordinals for these exports are above
1000. Note that any application that uses a particular Windows Sockets DLL's
private APIs will most likely not work on any other vendor's Windows Sockets
implementation.  Only the APIs defined in this document are guaranteed to
be present in every Windows Sockets implementation.
<P>
If an application uses private interfaces of a particular vendor's Windows
Sockets DLL, it is recommended that the DLL not be statically linked with
the application but rather dynamically loaded with the Windows routines
<B>LoadLibrary()</B> and<B> GetProcAddress().</B>  This allows the application
to give an informative error message if it is run on a system with a Windows
Sockets DLL that does not support the same set of extended functionality.
