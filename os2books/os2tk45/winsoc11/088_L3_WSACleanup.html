<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
Terminate use of the Windows Sockets DLL.
<P>

<PRE>#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;</PRE>
 
<P>
<B>int PASCAL FAR WSACleanup ( void );</B>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
An application is required to perform a (successful) <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>call before it can use Windows Sockets services.  When it has completed
the use of Windows Sockets, the application must call<B> WSACleanup()</B> to
deregister itself from a Windows Sockets implementation and allow the implementation
to free any resources allocated on behalf of the application or DLL.  Any
open SOCK_STREAM sockets that are connected when<B> WSACleanup()</B> is
called are reset; sockets which have been closed with <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()
</A>but which still have pending data to be sent are not affected--the pending
data is still sent. 
<P>
There must be a call to<B> WSACleanup()</B> for every call to <A HREF="093_L3_WSAStartup.html">WSAStartup()
</A>made by a task.  Only the final<B> WSACleanup()</B> does the actual
cleanup; the preceding calls simply decrement an internal reference count
in the Windows Sockets DLL.  A naive application may ensure that<B> WSACleanup()
</B>was called enough times by calling<B> WSACleanup()</B> in a loop until
it returns WSANOTINITIALISED.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
The return value is 0 if the operation was successful. Otherwise the value
SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error number may be retrieved by
calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
Attempting to call<B> WSACleanup()</B> from within a blocking hook and then
failing to check the return code is a common Windows Sockets programming
error.  If an application needs to quit while a blocking call is outstanding,
the application must first cancel the blocking call with <A HREF="087_L3_WSACancelBlockingCal.html">WSACancelBlockingCall()
</A>then issue the<B> WSACleanup()</B> call once control has been returned
to the application.
<P>
<B>Notes For Windows Sockets Suppliers</B>
<P>
Well-behaved Windows Sockets applications will make a<B> WSACleanup()</B> call
to indicate deregistration from a Windows Sockets implementation.  This
function can thus, for example, be utilized to free up resources allocated
to the specific application.
<P>
A Windows Sockets implementation must be prepared to deal with an application
which terminates without invoking<B> WSACleanup()</B> -- for example, as
a result of an error.
<P>
In a multithreaded environment,<B> WSACleanup()</B> terminates Windows Sockets
operations for all threads.
<P>
A Windows Sockets implementation must ensure that<B> WSACleanup()</B> leaves
things in a state in which the application can invoke<B> WSAStartup()</B> to
re-establish Windows Sockets usage.
