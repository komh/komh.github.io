Establish a socket to listen for incoming connection.

<UL> A descriptor identifying a bound, unconnected
socket.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> backlog</I><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> The
maximum length to which the queue of pending connections may grow.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
To accept connections, a socket is first created with <A HREF="069_L3_socket.html">socket()</A>,
a backlog for incoming connections is specified with<B> listen</B>(), and
then the connections are accepted with <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A>.
<B>listen</B>() applies only to sockets that support connections, i.e. those
of type SOCK_STREAM.  The socket<I> s</I> is put into "passive" mode where
incoming connections are acknowledged and queued pending acceptance by the
process.
<P>
This function is typically used by servers that could have more than one
connection request at a time: if a connection request arrives with the queue
full, the client will receive an error with an indication of WSAECONNREFUSED.
<B>listen</B>() attempts to continue to function rationally when there are
no available descriptors.  It will accept connections until the queue is
emptied. If descriptors become available, a later call to<B> listen</B>()
or <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A> will re-fill the queue to the
current or most recent "backlog", if possible, and resume listening for
incoming connections.
<P>
Compatibility<I> backlog</I> is currently limited (silently) to 5.  As in
4.3BSD, illegal values (less than 1 or greater than 5) are replaced by the
nearest legal value.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
If no error occurs,<B> listen()</B> returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of SOCKET_ERROR
is returned, and a specific error code may be retrieved by calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.
