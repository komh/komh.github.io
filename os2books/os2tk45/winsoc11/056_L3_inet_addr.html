<UL> A character string representing a number

<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function interprets the character string specified by the<I> cp</I> parameter.
 This string represents a numeric Internet address expressed in the Internet
standard "." notation.  The value returned is a number suitable for use
as an Internet address.  All Internet addresses are returned in network
order (bytes ordered from left to right).  Internet Addresses
<P>
Values specified using the "." notation take one of the following forms:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a.b.c.d<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a.b.c<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a.b<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of data and
assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an Internet address.
 Note that when an Internet address is viewed as a 32-bit integer quantity
on the Intel architecture, the bytes referred to above appear as "d.c.b.a".
 That is, the bytes on an Intel processor are ordered from right to left.

<P>
Note: The following notations are only used by Berkeley, and nowhere else
on the Internet.  In the interests of compatibility with their software,
they are supported as specified.
<P>
When a three part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as
a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two bytes of the network
address. This makes the three part address format convenient for specifying
Class B network addresses as "128.net.host".
<P>
When a two part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as a
24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three bytes of the network
address.  This makes the two part address format convenient for specifying
Class A network addresses as "net.host".
<P>
When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in the network
address without any byte rearrangement.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
If no error occurs,<B> inet_addr()</B> returns an unsigned long containing
a suitable binary representation of the Internet address given. If the passed-in
string does not contain a legitimate Internet address, for example if a
portion of an "a.b.c.d" address exceeds 255,<B> inet_addr()</B> returns
the value INADDR_NONE.
