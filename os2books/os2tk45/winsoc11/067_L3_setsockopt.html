<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
<B>setsockopt()</B> sets the current value for a socket option associated
with a socket of any type, in any state.  Although options may exist at
multiple protocol levels, this specification only defines options that exist
at the uppermost "socket" level.  Options affect socket operations, such
as whether expedited data is received in the normal data stream, whether
broadcast messages may be sent on the socket, etc. There are two types of
socket options: Boolean options that enable or disable a feature or behavior,
and options which require an integer value or structure. To enable a Boolean
option,<I> optval</I> points to a nonzero integer.  To disable the option
<I>optval</I> points to an integer equal to zero.<I> optlen</I> should be
equal to sizeof(int) for Boolean options.  For other options,<I> optval
</I>points to the an integer or structure that contains the desired value
for the option, and<I> optlen</I> is the length of the integer or structure.

<P>
SO_LINGER controls the action taken when unsent data is queued on a socket
and a <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A> is performed.
 See <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A> for a description
of the way in which the SO_LINGER settings affect the semantics of <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A>.
The application sets the desired behavior by creating a<I> struct linger
</I>(pointed to by the<I> optval</I> argument) with the following elements:

<P>

<PRE>struct linger {        int     l_onoff;
        int     l_linger;
}
</PRE>

<P>
To enable SO_LINGER, the application should set<I> l_onoff</I> to a non-zero
value, set<I> l_linger</I> to 0 or the desired timeout (in seconds), and
call<B> setsockopt()</B>.  To enable SO_DONTLINGER (i.e. disable SO_LINGER)
<I>l_onoff</I> should be set to zero and<B> setsockopt()</B> should be called.

<P>
By default, a socket may not be bound (see <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A>)
to a local address which is already in use.  On occasions, however, it may
be desirable to "re-use" an address in this way.  Since every connection
is uniquely identified by the combination of local and remote addresses,
there is no problem with having two sockets bound to the same local address
as long as the remote addresses are different.  To inform the Windows Sockets
implementation that a <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A> on a socket
should not be disallowed because the desired address is already in use by
another socket, the application should set the SO_REUSEADDR socket option
for the socket before issuing the <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A>.
Note that the option is interpreted only at the time of the <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A>:
it is therefore unnecessary (but harmless) to set the option on a socket
which is not to be bound to an existing address, and setting or resetting
the option after the <A HREF="048_L3_bind.html">bind()</A> has no effect
on this or any other socket..
<P>
An application may request that the Windows Sockets implementation enable
the use of "keep-alive" packets on TCP connections by turning on the SO_KEEPALIVE
socket option.  A Windows Sockets implementation need not support the use
of keep-alives: if it does, the precise semantics are implementation-specific
but should conform to section 4.2.3.6 of RFC 1122:<I> Requirements for Internet
Hosts -- Communication Layers</I>. <!-- entering slot 77 --> If a connection
is dropped as the result of "keep-alives" the error code WSAENETRESET is
returned to any calls in progress on the socket, and any subsequent calls
will fail with WSAENOTCONN.
<P>
The TCP_NODELAY option disables the Nagle algorithm.  The Nagle algorithm
is used to reduce the number of small packets sent by a host by buffering
unacknowledged send data until a full-size packet can be sent.  However,
for some applications this algorithm can impede performance, and TCP_NODELAY
may be used to turn it off.  Application writers should not set TCP_NODELAY
unless the impact of doing so is well-understood and desired, since setting
TCP_NODELAY can have a significant negative impact of network performance.
 TCP_NODELAY is the only supported socket option which uses<I> level</I> IPPROTO_TCP;
all other options use level SOL_SOCKET.
<P>
Windows Sockets suppliers are encouraged (but not required) to supply output
debug information if the SO_DEBUG option is set by an application.  The
mechanism for generating the debug information and the form it takes are
beyond the scope of this specification. The following options are supported
for<B> setsockopt()</B>.  The Type identifies the type of data addressed
by<I> optval</I>.

SO_DEBUG        BOOL            Record debugging information.

                                setting SO_LINGER with <I>l_onoff</I> set to
                                zero.

SO_REUSEADDR    BOOL            Allow the socket to be bound to an address

                                coalascing.
