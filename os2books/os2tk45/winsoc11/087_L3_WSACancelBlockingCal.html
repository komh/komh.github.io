<H1>WSACancelBlockingCall()</H1><!-- entering slot 108 -->
<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
Cancel a blocking call which is currently in progress.
<P>

<PRE>#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;</PRE>
 
<P>
<B>int PASCAL FAR WSACancelBlockingCall ( void );</B>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function cancels any outstanding blocking operation for this task.
 It is normally used in two situations:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An application is processing a message which
has been received while a blocking call is in progress.  In this case, <A HREF="090_L3_WSAIsBlocking.html">WSAIsBlocking()
</A>will be true.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A blocking call is in progress, and Windows Sockets
has called back to the application's "blocking hook" function (as established
by <A HREF="091_L3_WSASetBlockingHook.html">WSASetBlockingHook()</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In each case, the original blocking call will terminate as soon as possible
with the error WSAEINTR.  (In (1), the termination will not take place until
Windows message scheduling has caused control to revert to the blocking
routine in Windows Sockets.  In (2), the blocking call will be terminated
as soon as the blocking hook function completes.)
<P>
In the case of a blocking <A HREF="050_L3_connect.html">connect()</A> operation,
the Windows Sockets implementation will terminate the blocking call as soon
as possible, but it may not be possible for the socket resources to be released
until the connection has completed (and then been reset) or timed out. This
is likely to be noticeable only if the application immediately tries to
open a new socket (if no sockets are available), or to <A HREF="050_L3_connect.html">connect()
</A>to the same peer.
<P>
Cancelling an <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()</A> or a <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()
</A>call does not adversely impact the sockets passed to these calls.  Only
the particular call fails; any operation that was legal before the cancel
is legal after the cancel, and the state of the socket is not affected in
any way.
<P>
Cancelling any operation other than <A HREF="047_L3_accept.html">accept()
</A>and <A HREF="064_L3_select.html">select()</A> can leave the socket in
an indeterminate state.  If an application cancels a blocking operation
on a socket, the only operation that the application can depend on being
able to perform on the socket is a call to <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()</A>,
although other operations may work on some Windows Sockets implementations.
 If an application desires maximum portability, it must be careful not to
depend on performing operations after a cancel.  An application may reset
the connection by setting the timeout on SO_LINGER to 0.
<P>
If a cancel operation comprimised the integrity of a SOCK_STREAM's data
stream in any way, the Windows Sockets implementation must reset the connection
and fail all future operations other than <A HREF="049_L3_closesocket.html">closesocket()
</A>with WSAECONNABORTED.
<P>
<B>Return Value</B>
<P>
The value returned by<B> WSACancelBlockingCall()</B> is 0 if the operation
was successfully canceled.  Otherwise the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned,
and a specific error number may be retrieved by calling <A HREF="089_L3_WSAGetLastError.html">WSAGetLastError()</A>.
<B>Comments  </B> Note that it is possible that the network operation completes
before the<B> WSACancelBlockingCall() </B> is processed, for example if
data is received into the user buffer at interrupt time while the application
is in a blocking hook.  In this case, the blocking operation will return
successfully as if<B> WSACancelBlockingCall()</B> had never been called.
 Note that the<B> WSACancelBlockingCall()</B> still succeeds in this case;
the only way to know with certainty that an operation was actually cancelled
is to check for a return code of WSAEINTR from the blocking call.
