<H1>Client-server model</H1><!-- entering slot 16 -->
<P>
The most commonly used paradigm in constructing distributed applications
is the client/server model.  In this scheme client applications request
services from a server application.  This implies an asymmetry in establishing
communication between the client and server.
<P>
The client and server require a well-known set of conventions before service
may be rendered (and accepted).  This set of conventions comprises a protocol
which must be implemented at both ends of a connection.  Depending on the
situation, the protocol may be symmetric or asymmetric.  In a symmetric
protocol, either side may play the master or slave roles.  In an asymmetric
protocol, one side is immutably recognized as the master, with the other
as the slave.  An example of a symmetric protocol is the TELNET protocol
used in the Internet for remote terminal emulation.  An example of an asymmetric
protocol is the Internet file transfer protocol, FTP.  No matter whether
the specific protocol used in obtaining a service is symmetric or asymmetric,
when accessing a service there is a "client process" and a "server process".

<P>
A server application normally listens at a well-known address for service
requests.  That is, the server process remains dormant until a connection
is requested by a client's connection to the server's address.  At such
a time the server process "wakes up" and services the client, performing
whatever appropriate actions the client requests of it.  While connection-based
services are the norm, some services are based on the use of datagram sockets.
