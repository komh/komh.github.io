<P>
Although blocking operations on sockets are supported under Windows Sockets,
their use is strongly discouraged.  Programmers who are constrained to use
blocking mode -- for example, as part of an existing application which is
to be ported -- should be aware of the semantics of blocking operations
in Windows Sockets.  See <A HREF="035_L3_BlockingNonblocking&.html">Blocking/Non
blocking &amp; Data Volatility</A> for more details.
