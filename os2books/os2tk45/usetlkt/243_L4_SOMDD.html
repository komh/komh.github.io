<P>
SOMDD is the DSOM daemon. It must be started prior to running a DSOM application.
The daemon can be started manually from the command line, or it could be
started automatically from a start-up script run at boot time. It can be
run in the background with the following command:
<PRE>START SOMDD
</PRE>

<P>
The SOMDD program requires no parameters. An optional<I> -q</I>  parameters
can be used to set "quiet" mode, to suppress messages.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The SOMDD.EXE program included with VisualAge C++ is incompatible
with the version of SOM used with OS/2 Warp Toolkit and should not be used.
You will need to update both your LIBPATH and PATH statements to ensure
that the OS/2 Warp Toolkit path is ahead of the VisualAge C++ compiler.
