<H1>Creating a Response File for LINK386</H1><!-- entering slot 198 -->
<P>
To operate LINK386 using a response file, you must first create a file that
contains the responses you want LINK386 to process. You can give the file
any name and create it with any text editor.
<P>
Type the following command at the command prompt:
<PRE>   LINK386 @<I>filename</I>[.ext]
</PRE>

<P>
The @ symbol tells LINK386 that<I> filename</I> is a response file. If the
file is not in the working directory, you must specify the path. Begin using
a response file at any point on the LINK386 command line or at any LINK386
prompt. The file should contain responses in the same order as the LINK386
prompts. Each response needs to be on a separate line. If you choose to
place responses on the same line, separate them with commas.
<P>
If the file does not contain responses for all the prompts, LINK386 displays
the appropriate prompt and waits for you to supply a response. End the response
file with a semicolon.
<P>
You can use special characters in the response file the same way you would
use them in responses entered at the keyboard.
