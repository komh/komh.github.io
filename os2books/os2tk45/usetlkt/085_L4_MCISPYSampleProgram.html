<P>
MCISPY (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\MCISPY) monitors media control interface
messages that are exchanged between applications and the OS/2 multimedia
subsystem.
<P>
In addition to teaching you about multimedia messages, MCISPY also serves
as a powerful debugging aid.
<P>
The MCISPY sample must be manually set up. To do so, follow these steps:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy the MDM.DLL file located in the \MMOS2\DLL
subdirectory to the \TOOLKIT\DLL subdirectory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the DLLRNAME tool (available with C Set ++
or VisualAge C++) to rename the copy to MCI.DLL. To do this, type:
<PRE>DLLRNAME MDM.DLL MDM=MCI
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create the executable (MCISPY.EXE) and the stub
DLL (MDM.DLL) by running the MCISPY makefile.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Place the stub MDM.DLL, built by the MCISPY makefile,
in the LIBPATH so that it is recognized prior to the MDM.DLL file located
in the \MMOS2\DLL subdirectory. The source code for the stub MDM.DLL is
included in the MCISPY sample.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restart your system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Driver notifications might not be visible in releases prior
to OS/2 Warp Version 3. These notifications include all multimedia messages
routed through mdmDriverNotify().<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

are selected, but Workplace Shell objects will not be created for them if
the installed operating system is not OS/2 Warp.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
