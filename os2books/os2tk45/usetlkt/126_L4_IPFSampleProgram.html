<P>
IPF (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\PM\IPF) demonstrates how to use the IPF
to create an online document. This sample program features customized windows
that display text, graphics, and animation.
<P>
Two files are associated with this sample:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->IPF online document (INF)
<P>
The .INF file is the compiled IPF document. The source contains tagging
that defines different types of windows. Tags that control the format and
display of text also are included in this file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->OS/2 dynamic link library (DLL)
<P>
The .DLL file is the compiled OS/2 C language source for the code object
that is called when the .INF file is read at run time. A series of bitmaps
used for animation are included in the .DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
