<P>
The Assembly Language Processor (ALP) is a macro assembler that runs under
the 32-bit OS/2 operating system. ALP is designed as a functional replacement
for the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). It accepts the full syntax of
the MASM 5.10 assembly language, which is a subset of the MASM 6.00 high-level
directive language.  It also understands the complete Intel 80X86 instruction
set, including the MMX extensions. ALP creates standard Object Module Format
(.OMF) files that can be linked to produce DOS or OS/2 executables and can
generate line number debug information compatible with IBM's Presentation
Manager Debugger. In addition, this tool offers a rich set of command-line
options, as well as a comprehensive listing file with user-tailored formatting,
allowing a visual perspective not possible with other assemblers.
<P>
ALP translates assembly language source files (typically having a file-name
extension of .ASM) into object (.OBJ) files. The LINK386 utility can then
be used to combine multiple object files into a single executable file,
dynamic link library, or device driver.
<P>
While ALP is designed as a functional replacement for the Microsoft MASM
assembler in terms of source code compatibility, it does not use the MASM
command-line syntax. ALP uses a free-form syntax, has a comprehensive set
of options, and allows assembly of multiple input files with a single command-line
invocation.
<P>
For each corresponding input source file, ALP can produce the following
types of output files:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Object (.OBJ) files, which contain program data and
executable code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Listing (.LST) files, which document the results of
the assembly.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Message (.MSG) files, which can contain all error,
warning, and informational messages produced during the assembly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
See the<I> ALP Programming Guide and Reference</I> for more information
on ALP. Online help is also available from the command line for all ALP
options.
