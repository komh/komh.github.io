<P>
WPSTUTOR displays the order in which object methods are invoked by the Workplace
Shell. When a sample object's class method is executed, the method's name
and a description of its function are displayed in a PM window. The sample
saves the object's title and its icon title backwards.
<P>
This object class subclasses the WPDataFile class. Most Workplace Shell
instance and class methods are overridden so that information about the
methods can be displayed to the user.
<P>
This sample is designed to be more of a tutorial for Workplace Shell programming
than a programming example.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The SHOWDESC.EXE file should be renamed to SHOWDESC.BAK (or
something else) to turn off the sample. Rename the file back to SHOWDESC.EXE
to turn the sample back on.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
