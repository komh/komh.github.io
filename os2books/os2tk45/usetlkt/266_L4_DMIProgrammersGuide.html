<H1>DMI Programmer's Guide</H1><!-- entering slot 269 -->
<P>
This book is designed as a programmer's guide for the System Management
Agent, which provides access to system components that have been defined
according to the Desktop Management Interface (DMI) standard.  These components
can be hardware or software in the system that have been defined in the
Management Information Format (MIF).  Although the DMI itself is protocol-independent,
the System Management Agent can manage any DMI-enabled components in the
system and translate the MIF information into SNMP management information
bases (MIBs).
