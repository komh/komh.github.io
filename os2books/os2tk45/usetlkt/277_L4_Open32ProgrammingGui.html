<UL>How
to use the SMART tool to analyze Windows code and see how much effort is
involved to migrate it to OS/2 code<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Differences
in behavior between some Open32 functions and their Windows counterparts

<P>
As an enhancement for Open32, the OS/2 Resource Compiler (RC) now supports
string IDs for resources in addition to numbers. You can use either SMART
or the Resource Compiler to convert resources. If you use the Resource Compiler,
you do not need to include the hhh file with your code. OS/2 supports string
IDs that contain quotation marks. See the discussion of the RESOURCE statement
in the<I> Tools Reference</I> for more information.
