<H1>IBM OS/2 Server Family Programming Reference</H1><!-- entering slot 274 -->
<P>
This reference provides a description of the application programming interfaces
(APIs) provided by the IBM Operating System/2 for OS/2 Warp Servers, LAN
Servers, and the Directory and Security Server (DSS). These functions provide
the functional interface for server and client application development.
The OS/2 operating system referred to in this book is OS/2 Versions 2.1
through OS/2 Warp 4 (with the applicable CSDs and ServicePaks applied).

<P>
This book also provides the OS/2 Warp LAN Requester API. These functions
are 32-bit and are generally consistent with the Net32xxx and Dos32xxx LAN
functions that are included with LAN Server 4.0. DOS refers to DOS versions
3.3, 5.0, 6.x, or 7.0.
<P>
This book is written as a reference for the application or system programmer
who is developing Directory and Security Server (DSS) software applications
or OS/2 LAN Server software for a LAN Server, LAN Requester, OS/2 Warp Connect
LAN Requester (client only), or DOS LAN Services (DLS) workstation. Information
in this book applies to the following servers and clients:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
This book includes DLS programming information that is not supported by
Directory and Security Server.
<P>
The reader should be familiar with programming the OS/2 base operating system
or an equivalent multitasking operating system and should understand the
C programming language.
