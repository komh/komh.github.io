This book provides information about the interface (API) for the Arabic
and Hebrew languages to help programmers create Arabic or Hebrew applications
for this environment.
<P>
The Bidirectional support in PM is provided in the Arabic and Hebrew language
versions of the OS/2 operating system. The support is active/configured
when the COUNTRY selection during OS/2 installation is Arabic or Hebrew
in these versions.
