<H1>TRCUST, MAKETSF, and DEBDEL</H1><!-- entering slot 212 -->
<P>
The Trace Customizer utility program (TRCUST) converts a trace source file
(TSF) to a trace format file (TFF) that defines the formatting for an event
trace record. You can use TRCUST to combine multiple TFFs into a single
TFF.
<P>
Two additional tools that are complementary to TRCUST are also included
in the Toolkit:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MAKETSF
<P>
The purpose of MAKETSF is to extract dynamic trace definitions imbedded
in C or ASM source file to which they  relate. MAKETSF can also substitute
line number information into those trace definitions that are specified
by line number and source file reference.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DEBDEL
<P>
The purpose of DEBDEL is to remove debugging information from a load module
after TRCUST has generated the trace definition file (TDF).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For more information on all of these tools, refer to the<I> OS/2 Debugging
Handbook.</I>
