<H1>Windows Sockets</H1><!-- entering slot 292 -->
<P>
The Windows Sockets specification defines a network programming interface
for Microsoft Windows, which is based on the "socket" paradigm popularized
in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) from the University of California
at Berkeley.  It encompasses both familiar Berkeley socket style routines
and a set of Windows-specific extensions designed to help the programmer
to take advantage of the message-driven nature of Windows.
<P>
The Windows Sockets Specification is intended to provide a single API to
which application developers can program and multiple network software vendors
can conform.  Furthermore, in the context of a particular version of Microsoft
Windows, it defines a binary interface (ABI) such that an application written
to the Windows Sockets API can work with a conformant protocol implementation
from any network software vendor.  This specification thus defines the library
calls and associated semantics to which an application developer can program
and which a network software vendor can implement.
<P>
Network software which conforms to this Windows Sockets specification will
be considered "Windows Sockets Compliant."  Suppliers of interfaces that
are "Windows Sockets Compliant" are referred to as "Windows Sockets Suppliers."
To be Windows Sockets Compliant, a vendor must implement 100% of this Windows
Sockets specification.
<P>
Applications that are capable of operating with any "Windows Sockets Compliant"
protocol implementation are considered as having a "Windows Sockets Interface"
and are referred to as "Windows Sockets Applications."
<P>
This version of the Windows Sockets specification defines and documents
the use of the API in conjunction with the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS,
generally referred to as TCP/IP).  Specifically, all Windows Sockets implementations
support both stream (TCP) and datagram (UDP) sockets.
<P>
While the use of this API with alternative protocol stacks is not precluded
(and is expected to be the subject of future revisions of the specification),
such usage is beyond the scope of this version of the specification.
