<P>
LINK386 is used to combine object files and standard library files into
a single executable file. LINK386 also generates DLLs and device drivers.

<P>
LINK386 uses the following files as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One or more object files that are linked with any
optional library files to create the executable file.  Object files usually
have a .OBJ extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One or more library files. The library files contain
object modules that are linked with the object files to create the executable
file. Library files usually have a .LIB extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A module definition file. The module definition file
provides information to LINK386 about the executable file or dynamic link
library file it is creating. The module definition file usually has a .DEF
extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
LINK386 produces three types of output files:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An executable file.  This executable file runs under
OS/2 whenever you specify a module definition file that has a NAME statement.
The executable file usually has an .EXE extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A dynamic link library file. A dynamic link library
is produced whenever you specify a module definition file that has a LIBRARY
statement. A dynamic link library file usually has a .DLL extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A device driver file. A virtual or physical device
driver is produced whenever you specify a module definition file that has
the VIRTUAL DEVICE or PHYSICAL DEVICE statements. A device driver file usually
has a .SYS extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Three additional options are available with the OS/2 Warp Toolkit:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>E[XEPACK:{1|2}]<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Causes pages of code and data
in the file to be compressed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /NOO[UTPUTONERROR]
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Prevents the LINK386 from creating the executable
file if an error is encountered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /NOS[ECTORALIGNCODE]
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Turns off the alignment feature provided through
the LINK386 linker. LINK386 normally aligns pages of code on sector (512
byte) boundaries, reducing the time to load the pages when the application
is executed. The /NOSECTORALIGNCODE option aligns pages of code based on
the value used in the /ALIGN option.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
