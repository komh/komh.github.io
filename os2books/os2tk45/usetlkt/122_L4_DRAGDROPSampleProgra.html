<H1>DRAGDROP Sample Program</H1><!-- entering slot 125 -->
<P>
DRAGDROP (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\PM\DRAGDROP) demonstrates how to move
files between directories by using the drag and drop operation of direct
manipulation. This sample program creates a drop-down list box that contains
a scrollable file name list of the current directory.
<P>
To change the current directory, select the<B> Window</B> option, type in
the directory name, and press Enter. To change the current directory to
one higher in the directory tree, select<B> File</B> from the menu bar,
and then<B> Open</B>. The Select subdirectory window is displayed. Type
in the name of the subdirectory, and then select OK.
<P>
DRAGDROP must be started twice, so that there are two running instances
of the sample. Then, using a mouse, you can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Display a directory file list in the first sample.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select a file name from the second sample.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Drag the file name (using the right mouse button)
to the directory in the first sample.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Drop the file name into the directory in the first
sample.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The file is now moved to the chosen directory of the first sample.
