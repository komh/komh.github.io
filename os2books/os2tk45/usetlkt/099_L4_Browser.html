<P>
The Browser sample enables you to view the lines of text files in a Multiple
Document Interface (MDI) environment. The sample provides files containing
the program source code. You can open one or more of them, scroll them,
change their display fonts, and arrange their windows or icons inside the
sample program window.
<P>
There are two versions of the Browser sample. The Win32 version, located
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\BROWSER subdirectory, will build without
source changes on a Win32 system with the appropriate development tools.
(Win32 tools are not provided with the OS/2 Warp Toolkit.)
<P>
The OS/2 version of Browser is located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\BROWSER2
subdirectory.
