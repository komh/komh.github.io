WPCLSLST (Workplace Class List) creates a workplace object class and an
instance of a workplace object class. Workplace objects are constructed
using the SOM protocol and are instances of one of the following workplace
object classes:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Predefined<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> These classes are defined by the system.
Examples of predefined workplace object classes are WPObject, WPFileSystem,
and WPAbstract.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Subclass<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> These
classes are derived from existing predefined workplace object classes. They
add or remove function; however, they retain the basic behavior of that
class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Replaced<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> These classes
replace the class being subclassed. They notify the behavior of an instance
of a predefined workplace object class without the instance being aware
of the new class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
