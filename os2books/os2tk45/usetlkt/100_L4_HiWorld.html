<P>
HiWorld is a simple Windows 32-bit (Win32) application that displays the
following text, centered in the client area of the main window:
<PRE>Hello, World
</PRE>

<P>
There are two versions of the HiWorld sample. The Win32 version, located
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\HIWORLD subdirectory, will build without
source changes on a Win32 system with the appropriate development tools.
(Win32 tools are not provided with the OS/2 Warp Toolkit.)
<P>
The OS/2 version of HiWorld is located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\HIWORLD2
subdirectory along with a README that briefly describes the steps that were
taken to convert the Win32 version of HiWorld to this native OS/2 executable.
