<P>
RC (Resource Compiler) is a tool that lets you add application resources,
such as message strings, pointers, menus, and dialog boxes, to your application's
executable file. The primary purpose of RC is to prepare data for applications
that use functions such as WinLoadString, WinLoadPointer, WinLoadMenu, and
WinLoadDlg. These functions load resources from the application's executable
file or another specified executable file. The application then can use
the loaded resources as needed.
<P>
RC and the resource functions let you define and modify application resources
without recompiling the application itself. RC can modify the resources
in an executable file at any time without affecting the rest of the file.
You can create custom applications from a single executable file by using
RC to add the custom resources you need to each application.  RC is especially
important for international language support because it lets you define
all language-dependent data, such as message strings, as resources. Preparing
the application for a new language is simply a matter of adding new resources
to the existing executable file.
