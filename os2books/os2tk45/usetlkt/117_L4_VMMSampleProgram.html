VMM (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OS2\VMM) demonstrates the use of virtual
memory by using new memory-management functions to allocate and set the
attributes of memory. Users can read or write data into memory and reset
the attributes using a dialog box. The memory manager protects or opens
the virtual memory to read or write operations according to the different
attributes of each memory block. To free memory, the user enters the address
of the memory.
