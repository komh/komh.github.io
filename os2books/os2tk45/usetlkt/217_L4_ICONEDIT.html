<P>
ICONEDIT (Icon Editor) is used to create icons, pointers, and bitmaps. In
the PM, an icon is a graphic symbol that identifies a data object, a system
action, or a minimized application. A pointer is a small shape on the screen
that reflects the movement of the mouse. Pointers have a<I> hot spot</I> that
identifies their exact location on the screen.
<P>
Icons, pointers, and bitmaps produced by the Icon Editor are graphic symbols
comprised of pels in any of the following display states:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Black<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->White<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Screen (background color)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inverse screen (inverse of background color).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Mini-icons (also called small icons) are icons that are one-half the size
of normal icons (also called large icons). Normal icons are 32x32 or 40x40
pels (depending on the monitor resolution). Mini-icons are 16x16 or 20x20
pels. They are used in areas where a normal icon is too large, for example,
in toolbars.
<P>
If you previously had OS/2 installed on your system, and if you did not
update your icon profile when you installed this OS/2 Warp Toolkit, you
need to run the Icon Editor once with its profile update options in order
to use the mini-icon forms. To do this, enter:
<PRE><I>X</I>:\TOOLKIT\BIN\ICONEDIT /t /i</PRE>

<P>
where<I> X</I> is the drive location for the installed OS/2 Warp Toolkit.

<P>
After the initial run of Icon Editor, the new mini-icons will be part of
your profile and you will not need to use options /t /i again.
