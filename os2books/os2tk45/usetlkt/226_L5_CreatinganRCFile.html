<P>
All resources are defined in a resource script file. You use a text editor
to create a resource script file that has an .RC extension. Resources are
defined either explicitly in statements in the resource script file, or
in other files (such as output files from the resource editors). The .RC
file is the input file to the RC; the output has an .RES extension. The
.RC file can contain statements that define resources and that include resources
from other files. Text-based resources such as menus, accelerator keys,
and text strings are defined in the .RC file. Non-text-based resources are
specified in the .RC file as file names of the external files where these
resources reside. Such resources include icons, pointers, and bitmaps. The
syntax for including external files in a resource script varies according
to the nature of the resources defined or contained in the files. Fonts
have a resource file to themselves.
<P>
Make sure that none of the include files in your resource script file contain
an end-of-file character. When the RC sees an end-of-file character, it
assumes it to be the end of all input.

For an example of a resource script file, see the sample program <A DEPENDENT XPOS=RIGHT YPOS=BOTTOM WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=100% GROUP=2 HREF="131_L4_TEMPLATESampleProgra.html"><!-- extra bytes: 03 06 44 02 00 08 00 11 32 00 64 00 02 00 -->TEMPLATE</A>.
