<P>
ToyBox is a basic Win32 application that uses bit-block transfer (BitBlt)
to display a large number of simple bitmaps on the display screen and give
them motion. It moves the objects around the client portion of the screen
and makes the objects appear to change shape and rotate.
<P>
There are two versions of the ToyBox sample. The Win32 version, located
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\TOYBOX subdirectory, will build without source
changes on a Win32 system with the appropriate development tools. (Win32
tools are not provided with the OS/2 Warp Toolkit.)
<P>
The OS/2 version of ToyBox is located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\TOYBOX2
subdirectory.
