<H1>SMTMP Environment Variable</H1><!-- entering slot 240 -->
<P>
The SMTMP environment variable specifies the name of a directory that the
SOM compiler uses to hold intermediate output files. The syntax is as follows:

<PRE>SMTMP=&lt;dir&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
For example:
<PRE>SET SMTMP=%TMP%
</PRE>

<P>
tells the SOM compiler to use the same directory for temporary files as
given by the setting of the TMP environment variable. As a general rule,
the directory indicated by SMTMP should never coincide with the directory
used by the SOM compiler for its input or the emitted output files.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> All command-line modifiers can be set in the environment by
changing them to UPPERCASE and preappending SM to them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
