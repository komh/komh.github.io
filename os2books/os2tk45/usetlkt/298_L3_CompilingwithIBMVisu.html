<H1>Compiling with IBM VisualAge C++ for OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 301 -->
<P>
The latest version of the C Set ++ compiler (now called VisualAge C++) has
been released. VisualAge C++ includes its own version of the OS/2 Warp Toolkit,
which includes updated sample makefiles. Changes to the sample makefiles
relate to the new linker (ILINK) and to the new library (CPPOM30.LIB).
<P>
With this version of the OS/2 Warp Toolkit, the same sample makefile changes
have been made so that you can use VisualAge C++.
<P>
You can compile the samples included with the OS/2 Warp Toolkit with C Set
++ (using LINK386) by changing any reference to CPPOM30.LIB to:
<PRE>DDE4MBS.LIB
</PRE>

<P>
and changing any reference to ILINK to:
<PRE>LINK386
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<I> /nofree</I> option must be removed from the LINK386
statement.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
