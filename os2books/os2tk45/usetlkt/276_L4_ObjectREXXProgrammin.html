<H1>Object REXX Programming Guide for OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 279 -->
<P>
The<I> Object REXX Programming Guide for OS/2</I> describes the Object-based
REstructured eXtended eXecutor, or Object REXX programming language. (When
not comparing it to its traditional predecessor, it is just referred to
as REXX.) REXX is an integral part of the OS/2 operating system.
<P>
This information is aimed at developers familiar with OS/2 who want to use
REXX to do object-oriented programming--or some mix of traditional and object-oriented
programming--with the shortest learning curve possible.
<P>
This information assumes you are already familiar with the techniques of
traditional structured programming and uses them as a springboard for explaining
REXX and, in particular, Object REXX. This "no frills" approach is designed
to help experienced programmers get involved quickly with the REXX language,
exploit its virtues, and become productive fast.
