<H1>REXX Guard and Reply Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 160 -->
<P>
The GREPLY.CMD sample in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\REXX directory demonstrates
the difference between Guarded and UnGuarded methods.  In the first example,
the method is guarded, so it does not begin execution until the final result
is tallied.  In the second example, the method is unguarded so it can begin
execution while method sum_up is still looping.  In fact, unguarded_get
often runs immediately after the Reply, so using a guard instruction ensures
sum_up runs for a bit before unguarded_get returns with the intermediate
sum.
<P>
For this sample to function properly, Object REXX must be installed.
