<H1>Known Limitations for DIVE</H1><!-- entering slot 304 -->
<P>
DIVE will not run in direct mode on some systems if the video card requires
bank switching. To determine if your video card requires bank switching,
select<B> Query Caps</B> from the Options menu of the DIVE sample. If the
<B>Screen access requires bank switch</B> field is set to YES, setting a
lower Desktop resolution in the System Setup might fix this.
<P>
DIVE might not work on some systems when the Desktop is set to 16 million
colors. If your system is set to 16 million colors and DIVE does not work
properly, try setting the Desktop to fewer colors in the System Setup.
