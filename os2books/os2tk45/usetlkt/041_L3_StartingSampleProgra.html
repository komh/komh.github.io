<H1>Starting Sample Programs</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
There are two ways to start a sample program:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the Desktop:
<P>
When installed, all sample programs (with the exception of the bidirectional
samples, TCP/IP samples, Problem Determination samples, LAN Server samples,
some of the Multimedia samples, and some of the Workplace Shell samples)
appear in the sample programs folders located within the Toolkit folder.
To start a sample program, open the Toolkit folder, open the folder representing
the type of samples you wish to execute, and then select the appropriate
sample program.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From an OS/2 command prompt:
<P>
Change to the subdirectory where the sample is located, type the name of
the executable file and press Enter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Most samples include a description file (or makefile) that you can use to
build the sample yourself. The name of the makefile is either MAKEFILE or
<I>filename</I>.MAK, where<I> filename</I> refers to the name of the sample.
To build the sample,<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Go to an OS/2 command prompt and change to the
subdirectory where the makefile is located.
<P>
You must execute these commands from the subdirectory where the makefile
is located in order to build the sample correctly.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enter one of the following, depending on the
name of the makefile:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->When the name of the makefile is MAKEFILE, type:

<PRE>  NMAKE</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->When the name of the makefile is<I> filename</I>.MAK,
type:
<PRE>  NMAKE /f <I>filename</I>.MAK
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For information about the <A HREF="204_L4_NMAKE.html">NMAKE</A> tool, refer
to the<I> Tools Reference</I>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The makefile assumes that you are using the IBM VisualAge
C++ for OS/2 compiler for code compilation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
