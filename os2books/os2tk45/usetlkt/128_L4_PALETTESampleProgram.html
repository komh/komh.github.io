<P>
When started, PALETTE displays a standard window with a large OS/2 logo
in the foreground. You have the ability to change the OS/2 logo to the IBM
logo. If you resize the window, the logo is scaled and redrawn to fit the
new window size. You can also control the animation speed from the PALETTE
menu.
<P>
The animation is performed by:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating a clip path that represents the outline of
the logo characters (which are displayed using an outline font).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

the clip path to the presentation space.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Drawing a series of lines to the presentation
space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Each line is drawn with an incremental color index. Palette animation is
performed using the 32-bit GpiAnimatePalette function.
<P>
In order for PALETTE to remain responsive to system and user messages, no
animation is performed on the main window procedure thread. A second thread
is created from which all animation is performed.
