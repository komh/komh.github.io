<H1>Known Limitations for the Container Part</H1><!-- entering slot 303 -->
<P>
The Container part has the following known limitations. Note that the behavior
described below will be exhibited by all samples that subclass from the
Container part.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A SYS3175 error occurs when you select<B> Open As-&gt;Details
</B>from the Container part's View menu.  This error will close the document.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A SYS3175 error occurs when saving a document containing
a selected Container part inside a root Container part.  It will occur if
the selected part subclasses from the Container part.  This error will not
occur if the selected part, for example, is the Cookbook part.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Container part's<B> Show As</B> menu selection
from the View menu does not work correctly. This selection will incorrectly
change the view type of selected parts, when it should only change the activated
part's view type. The correct way to change the view type of selected parts
would be to select<B> Show selection as</B> from the Edit menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> Move</B> selection from the Edit menu is incorrectly
enabled for an activated part. The<B> Move</B> selection, like all Edit
menu selections, are for selected parts only.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A part that subclasses from the Container part may
not have its intrinsic content clipped correctly to the embedded parts.
 The Container part correctly handles the clipping of its embedded parts,
but there is no way for a part that subclasses from the Container part to
tell the Container part how to clip the embedded parts to its own content.
Generally, the subclass part's intrinsic content will write over the embedded
parts.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
