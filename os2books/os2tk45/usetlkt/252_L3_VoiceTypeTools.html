<P>
The Grammar Compiler takes a plain-text grammar file (BNF) and compiles
it into a finite state grammar file (FSG). The FSG file is what the speech
engine uses at run time to determine which words and phrases are currently
available for a user to say to your application.
<P>
Documentation on the Grammar compiler can be found in the<I> Grammar Guide</I>.
The VoiceType Developer's Toolkit also includes the following utilities
to assist you in evaluating grammars:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

(FSG) and What Can I Say (WCS) files, allowing grammars to be displayed

The Grammar compiler and utilities are located in the TOOLKIT\SPEECH\BIN
