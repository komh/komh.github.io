<H1>FSDIVE Sample Program</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
FSDIVE (full-screen DIVE) demonstrates the use of multimedia's direct interface
video extensions (DIVE) by repeatedly displaying a short animation sequence.
The animation is performed by sequentially displaying a series of up to
16 bitmaps in a PM window. You can display the default bitmaps that are
included with the sample or specify the bitmaps by passing the file names
as command line parameters.
<P>
After the application is started, you can move or resize the window and
observe the effects on the frame rate of the animation (displayed on the
title bar).
<P>
The latest version of the DIVE interface has been enhanced to allow an application
to take over the display and change the resolution. This enables an application
to run in a full screen without paying the performance penalty of maintaining
a high-resolution Desktop. Full-screen DIVE can be activated by using the
Alt+Home hot key.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To run the full-screen DIVE sample on an OS/2 Warp Version
3 system, you must first install full-screen support by running GSRVINST.EXE
(located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\FSDIVE). See the GAMESRVR.DOC file in the
same directory for more details. This installation is not necessary on an
OS/2 Warp Version 4 or later system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The maximum window size of this sample has been limited to 640x480 because
larger window sizes can cause excessive swapping on machines with less than
16MB.
