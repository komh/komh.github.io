<H1>Problem Determination Guide and Reference</H1><!-- entering slot 285 -->
<P>
This book provides programmers with guide and reference information for
collecting and managing problem determination data.
<P>
This book first provides conceptual and introductory information about OS/2
Warp's First Failure Support Technology (FFST). This sophisticated and powerful
tool requires thoughtful planning and code instrumentation. These topics
present planning, setup, and examples that are used for collecting and managing
problem determination data.
<P>
Separate sections are devoted to understanding the aids that are provided
for tracking, collecting, storing, and formatting problem determination
data, such as traces, dumps, and error logs.
<P>
After reading this book you should understand the benefits of FFST and know
how to instrument your code. This understanding enables you to take advantage
of the technology and tools that are associated with problem determination
data. You should also know how to use the API, trace, error logging, and
dump functions. These functions retrieve, format, and analyze problem determination
data.
<P>
This book assumes that you have the OS/2 Toolkit installed and you are developing
application programs.
