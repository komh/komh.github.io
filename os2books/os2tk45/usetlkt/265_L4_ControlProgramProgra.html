<P>
This book provides the C-language syntax for each of the base operating-system
application programming interfaces (APIs), including input and output parameters,
data structures, data types, return codes, and example codes. Guidance information
is also provided to assist you in developing applications using these items.
API functions (indicated by the prefix "Dos") are presented by component,
such as Error Management, Exception Management, and File System. The API
functions, within each of the components to which they apply, are listed
in alphabetic order. API functions also are available from a single alphabetic
list.
