<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->A fix was made so that recursive invocations of NMAKE
(normally made via the $(MAKE) macro) will always be able to locate the
executable module from which NMAKE was loaded, even if the PATH environment
variable was altered by the makefile and no longer references the location
where the module was originally found.<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->NMAKE now has the ability to set the extended LIBPATH
values (BEGINLIBPATH and ENDLIBPATH) in the same way that the system command
processor (CMD.EXE) does.  For more information on BEGINLIBPATH and ENDLIBPATH,
see the description of the<B> DosQueryExtLIBPATH()</B> and<B> DosSetExtLIBPATH()
</B>API's in the<I> Control Program Programming Guide and Reference</I>.
