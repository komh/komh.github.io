<P>
The accept_and_recv function call is explained in this sample program.  The
server opens a socket to which it binds and then does a listen on that socket.
 It starts the number of specified threads and does accept_and_recv on each
of them.  The client opens a socket, connects to the server and sends the
data. As the timeout option is set (by using setsockeopt), whenever the
client connects but doesn't send any data, the server times out.
