<P>
The XH and H files included with this OS/2 Warp Toolkit work only with the
IDL files included with this Toolkit. You will need to generate new SOM
bindings if you install a new version of SOM. This means that the XH and
H files will need to be re-emitted if new versions of the IDL files are
made available. There are two steps that you need to take.
<P>
If you install version 'Y' of SOM on top of version 'X', you will need to
generate SOM bindings for version 'Y'. The version 'X' SOM bindings are
not guaranteed to be compatible with version 'Y'.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the SOMSTARS.CMD file to generate the SOMSTARS
version of the bindings.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use SOMCORBA.CMD to generate the SOMCORBA version
of the bindings. This upgrades your SOM bindings.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The command file WPIDL2XH.CMD is provided to upgrade Workplace Shell bindings
for developers who will upgrade their SOMobjects Developer Toolkit in the
future. This command file emits the .XH header files from the Workplace
Shell .IDL files. The file should be invoked upon each of the .IDL files
from the OS/2 Warp Toolkit to regenerate the headers for C++. This is only
necessary when you upgrade to a new level of the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit.
Invoking the SOM compiler's .XH emitter on the Workplace Shell .IDL files
do not emit .XH files for you, because the Workplace Shell classes currently
only maintain passthru sections for .H files for C.
