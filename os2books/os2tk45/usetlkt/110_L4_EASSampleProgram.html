<P>
EAS (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OS2\EAEDIT) demonstrates a multithreaded
application that retrieves, modifies, or sorts files by their extended attribute
value. Included in this sample program are PM procedures for dialog boxes
and a standard client window. The sample lets you select an extended attribute
file name from a list, or enter a new name in an entry field. You can select
the extended attribute type from a table.
