<P>
When SOMobjects 2.0 (<I>not</I> the version included with this OS/2 Warp
Toolkit) is installed on OS/2 Warp Version 3, the LIBPATH, PATH, and DPATH
environment variables in CONFIG.SYS are changed to place the SOMobjects
directories before the operating system directories in the search order
for DLLs, EXEs, and data files. This causes the Workplace Shell to encounter
an unrecoverable error the next time the system is restarted because it
requires the SOM DLLs that are contained in the \OS2\DLL subdirectory.
<P>
In order to allow SOMobjects 2.0 Workstation applications to run successfully,
you must edit CONFIG.SYS and change the LIBPATH, PATH, and DPATH statements
before restarting the system. These statements must be changed to place
the operating system directories before the SOMobjects directories.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This only applies to SOMobjects Workstation applications,
not Workgroup applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
The same problem will occur for any application that includes SOMobjects
2.0 DLLs if the application places its DLL directory first in the LIBPATH.
Again, the workaround is to assure that the \OS2\DLL subdirectory is before
any other directory that contains earlier versions of the SOM DLLs. Any
changes made to the PATH and DPATH environment variables by the application
installation must also be reversed.
