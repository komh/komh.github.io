<H1>DIVE Sample Program</H1><!-- entering slot 76 -->
<P>
DIVE (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\DIVE) illustrates the use of the direct
interface video extensions. DIVE provides optimized blitting performance
for motion video subsystems and applications that perform rapid screen updates
in the OS/2 PM and full-screen environments. Using DIVE interfaces, applications
can either write directly to video memory or use the DIVE blitter. The DIVE
blitter takes advantage of acceleration hardware when present and applicable
to the function being performed.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The DIVE sample requires OS/2 Warp Version 3 or later in order
to execute properly. The files for the samples will be installed when the
samples are selected, but Workplace Shell objects will not be created for
them if the installed operating system is not OS/2 Warp Version 3 or higher.

<P>
The OS/2 Warp color support defaults to 16 colors. This means that your
setup needs to be updated; otherwise, the DIVE sample will not run.
<P>
The maximum window size of this sample has been limited to 640x480 because
larger window sizes can cause excessive swapping on machines with less than
16MB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
