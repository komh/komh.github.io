<P>
JIGSAW (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\PM\BMPSAMP) demonstrates the use of
bitmaps in a graphics application. This sample provides a jigsaw puzzle
based on the decomposition of an arbitrary bitmap loaded from a file. You
can jumble the pieces, and then drag them with a mouse. The image can be
made smaller, larger, scrolled horizontally, or scrolled vertically.
<P>
This sample program also demonstrates how to call the Information Presentation
Facility help hook, to create an instance and associate the instance with
the active application window.
