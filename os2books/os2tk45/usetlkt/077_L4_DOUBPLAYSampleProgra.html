<P>
DOUBPLAY (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\DOUBPLAY) enables an application
to play audio files directly from application memory buffers. An array of
multiple playlist structures that combines playlist commands with data buffers
can be constructed to perform complex operations on multiple buffers.
<P>
This sample takes a single wave file, MYWAVE.WAV, and plays it using a memory
playlist. The playlist is constructed as a circular buffer composed of a
series of small buffers, the sum of which might be larger than the size
of the .WAV file. This circular buffer is used to repeatedly play an audio
file when the PLAY button is selected. As each buffer in the playlist is
expended, the application refills the expended buffer with new data from
the .WAV file. When all the buffers in the playlist have been expended,
the playlist branches back to the first buffer to play the new data. This
circular buffering process continues until the STOP button is selected or
the application is closed.
