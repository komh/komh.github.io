<P>
NMAKE carries out all tasks needed to create or update a program after one
or more of the source files in the program have changed. NMAKE compares
the modification dates for one set of files (the target files) with those
of another set of files (the dependent files).  NMAKE then carries out a
given task only if a target file is out of date. NMAKE does not compile
and link all files just because one file was updated. This can save time
when creating programs that have many source files or that take several
steps to complete.
