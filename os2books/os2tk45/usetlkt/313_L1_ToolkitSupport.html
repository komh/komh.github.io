<P>
The OS/2 Developer's Toolkit provides programming tools, samples and information
to support end-user development of OS/2 applications.  We will make every
effort to respond to support requests, but the Toolkit is provided on an
as-is basis, and there is no guarantee of formal support.
<P>
Informal electronic support for the IBM Developer's Toolkit is provided
through the Internet and the OS/2 BBS.  Internet users may report problems
by sending mail to devcon@us.ibm.com.  Users may obtain informal support
or exchange ideas or comments by accessing the DEVCON CFORUM on the OS/2
BBS under Talklink (a feature under the IBMLink Commercial Services).  For
TalkLink access, U.S. customers can call 1-800-547-1283; other customers
can contact their IBM Marketing Representatives.
