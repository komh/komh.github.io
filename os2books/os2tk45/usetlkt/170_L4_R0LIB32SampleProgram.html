<P>
The client sends 1k of data (all 'a'). Then, the server modifies the data
(changes all 'a' to 'b') and sends the modified data to the client. The
client prints the data received from the server. The client sends a string
to the client using sendmsg() call, and the server receives it (by recvmsg()
call) and sends another string to the client. The client receives the string
and prints it. The client program is a ring3 program.  The server program
accesses the socket calls through r0lib32.
