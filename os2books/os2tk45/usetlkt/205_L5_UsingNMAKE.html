<H1>Using NMAKE</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
To use NMAKE, create a description file (or makefile). A description file,
in its simplest form, lists which files depend on others and which commands
need to be executed if a file changes. You can create an NMAKE description
file with any text editor that produces ASCII files.
<P>
A description file looks like this:
<PRE>    targets... : dependents...│
         command              │──── description block
            :                 │
    targets... : dependents...
         command
            :
</PRE>

<P>
A dependent relationship among files is defined in a<I> description block</I>.
A description block indicates the relationship among various parts of the
program. It contains commands to bring all components up-to-date. The description
file can contain any number of description blocks.
<P>
Use NMAKE description files for creating backup files, configuring data
files, and running programs when data files are modified.
