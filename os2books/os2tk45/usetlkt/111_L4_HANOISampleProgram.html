<H1>HANOI Sample Program</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
HANOI (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OS2\HANOI) demonstrates a multithreaded
application with the familiar "towers of Hanoi" puzzle. When the sample
program is started, you see three poles (A, B, and C). Initially, pole A
has on it a stack of disks starting with the largest disks on the bottom
and succeeding smaller disks on the top. The main thread handles the PM
interface and lets the you start or stop the Hanoi routine. It also lets
you reset the number of working disks. The second thread is created when
the<B> Start</B> item is selected from the<B> Options</B> menu. This thread
starts the recursive execution of the Hanoi algorithm, runs in the background,
and moves and paints the disks. All disks end up on pole C.
