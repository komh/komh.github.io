<H1>REXX Workplace Shell Class Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 153 -->
<P>
The WPSORXCL.CMD sample in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\REXX\WPS directory demonstrates
how to use the OS/2 Workplace Shell folders to represent Object REXX classes.
This is presented in a tree view where an Object REXX class is a folder
and subclasses are subfolders. The top folder title is updated as classes
are added for a progress indicator.  Methods in a class can be represented
as abstract WPS objects; but the default is not to create them because it
is quite time consuming.
<P>
For this sample to function properly, Object REXX must be installed.
<P>
The REXX Workplace Shell samples also require the REXX classes first be
registered with the Workplace Shell. To register REXX classes with the Workplace
Shell, type the following at an OS/2 command prompt:
<PRE>     WPSINST
</PRE>

<P>
The WPSINST.CMD program can be used at any time to query REXX classes and
to register and deregister them. To deregister the REXX classes, type the
following at an OS/2 command prompt:
<PRE>     WPSINST -
</PRE>
