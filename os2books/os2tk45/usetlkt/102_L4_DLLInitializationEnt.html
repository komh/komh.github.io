<H1>DLL Initialization Entry Point</H1><!-- entering slot 102 -->
<P>
The DLLMAIN.C file (located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\OPEN32\DLLENTRY subdirectory)
contains the DLL initialization/termination function, which is called when
a process gains or loses access to the DLL. The .DEF file used to build
the DLL needs to specify INITINSTANCE and TERMINSTANCE; otherwise, this
function will be called only for the first process to gain access and the
last process to free up the DLL.
<P>
This implementation is for IBM VisualAge C++ and assumes that the C Runtime
library is being statically linked to the DLL and that the library uses
C++ classes.
