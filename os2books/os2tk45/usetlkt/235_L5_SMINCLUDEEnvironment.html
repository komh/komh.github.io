<P>
The SOM compiler uses an environment variable called SMINCLUDE to locate
included class definitions. SMINCLUDE specifies where to search for .IDL
and .EFW files. Because every SOM class will have an include file for its
parent class definition, you must set SMINCLUDE before running the SOM compiler.
Its form is similar to the OS/2 PATH or DPATH environment variables, in
that it can consist of one or more directory names, separated by a semicolon.
Directory names can be specified with absolute or relative path names. The
syntax is as follows:
<PRE>SMINCLUDE=&lt;dir1&gt;[;&lt;dir2&gt;]+
</PRE>

<P>
For example:
<PRE>SET SMINCLUDE=.;C:\TOOLKIT\SOM\INCLUDE;C:\TOOLKIT\IDL;
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> All command-line modifiers can be set in the environment by
changing them to UPPERCASE and preappending SM to them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
