<H1>REXX Workplace Shell Folder Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 154 -->
<P>
The WPSORXFL.CMD sample in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\REXX\WPS directory demonstrates
useful routines for folders.  The first routine will take a WPS folder as
input and return an array of SOM objects; one for each object in that folder.
 The second routine will take an array of WPS objects and a string; returning
an array of objects that match the string.  The sample also uses three methods
to iterate over arrays as iteration examples.
<P>
For this sample to function properly, Object REXX must be installed.
<P>
The REXX Workplace Shell samples also require the REXX classes first be
registered with the Workplace Shell. To register REXX classes with the Workplace
Shell, type the following at an OS/2 command prompt:
<PRE>     WPSINST
</PRE>

<P>
The WPSINST.CMD program can be used at any time to query REXX classes and
to register and deregister them. To deregister the REXX classes, type the
following at an OS/2 command prompt:
<PRE>     WPSINST -
</PRE>
