ERRLOG2 (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\SYSMGT\ERRLOG\ERRLOG2) demonstrates
how to use the following functions to open event notification, wait on an
error log event, change an event filter, and then close event notification.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
LogOpenEventNotification<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogWaitEvent<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogChangeEventFilter<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogCloseEventNotification<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The program displays a message after each error logging function call indicating
whether the call was successful or not.  Because this program is using the
event notification functions, it will pause twice as it's waiting for an
error to be logged. At this time it will display a message indicating that
it is waiting for an event.
<P>
When event notification is started a filter is not specified.  Therefore,
on the first use of LogWaitEvent, any record placed in the log will cause
the notification to occur.  The LogChangeEventFilter function is then used
to filter on records where the vendor tag field contains IBM or the severity
of the error is less than, or equal, to 2.  In either case, the FFSTProbe
sample program (PROBE.EXE) will cause the notification to occur.
<P>
To run ERRLOG2, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->At an OS/2 command line, type:
<PRE>ERRLOG2</PRE>

<P>
It will run to the point where it displays a message stating that it is
waiting for an event.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open another OS/2 window and start the FFSTProbe
sample program by changing to the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\SYSMGT\FFST\PROBE subdirectory
and typing:
<PRE>PROBE
</PRE>

<P>
The ERRLOG2 program will display messages stating that it has received an
event, that it's changing the event filter, and that it is waiting for an
event.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open another OS/2 window and start the FFSTProbe
sample program again.
<P>
The ERRLOG2 program will again display a message stating that it has received
an event, followed by a message stating that it is closing event notification.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
