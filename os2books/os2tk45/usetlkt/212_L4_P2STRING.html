<P>
P2STRING is used to test OS/2 multimedia subsystems through the media control
interface string commands in the OS/2 multimedia environment. This tool
processes script files (containing string commands and tool directives)
to test the behavior of subsystems in OS/2 multimedia.  P2STRING extracts
the strings from the script files and processes the commands through the
mciSendString function. Messages and error conditions of the processes included
in the scripts are logged to an output file and displayed in windows.
<P>
P2STRING provides subsystem developers with an effective testing tool because
it alleviates the need for extensive test code to be written. Developers
can write script files to test all relevant scenarios and it also aids in
debugging using log files.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Refer to the README.P2S file in the P2STRING subdirectory
for information about how to use P2STRING and how to create script files
that it can process. The<I> OS/2 Multimedia Subsystem Programming Guide
</I>contains additional information describing P2STRING.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
