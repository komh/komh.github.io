<P>
TV tuner cards allow a desktop PC to receive and display broadcast television
signals. TUNER (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\TUNER), provides an example
of how to use the media control interface (MCI) string interface to control
a tuner card.
<P>
When the application is running, the display window can be sized and a TV
channel can be selected. The channel can be selected through up/down buttons
or a text entry field displayed at the bottom of the window.

A TV tuner card is handled as a digital video device by the multimedia subsystem.
A typical system has one or more digital video devices, with digitalvideo01
assigned to software motion video. By default this sample opens the digitalvideo02
device. If the tuner card is not assigned to digital video 2 an alternate
device ordinal must be provided at the command line with the following format:

<PRE>  /d=digitalvideo<I>xx</I></PRE>

<P>
where<I> xx</I> is a two digit number, padded on the left with zero.
<P>
For example:
<PRE>  /d=digitalvideo03
</PRE>

<P>
Most TV tuner cards, such as the Hauppauge WinTV card, support several video
sources. The connector number that corresponds to the tuner video source
is dependent on the hardware and might not be the same for each tuner card.
The connector number is not changed by this sample. Instead, it uses the
default connector number that is set by the Multimedia Setup program.
