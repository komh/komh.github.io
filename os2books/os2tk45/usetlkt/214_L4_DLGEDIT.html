<P>
DLGEDIT (Dialog Editor) is used to create and modify dialog boxes and specify
the controls and text within dialog boxes. As you create a dialog box and
add controls, the dialog editor draws it to the screen. You can resize and
reposition the dialog box, and then test its controls before you incorporate
it in your application.
<P>
Although the dialog editor draws box outlines and controls to the screen
so that you can view it from a user's perspective, the dialog editor does
not save it as a graphic. Instead, the dialog editor stores a description
of the dialog box and its controls in a text file that has a file-name extension
of .DLG. It also creates a compiled form of the .DLG file into a resource
file that has an extension of .RES. The dialog-box and resource files can
each contain descriptions of more than one dialog box. The resource file
can contain other application resources, such as icons, bitmaps, and string
tables. It is attached to the application's executable (.EXE) file after
the compile and link processes.
<P>
This version of the Dialog Editor is enhanced for use with Pen for OS/2.
With this enhanced version, handwriting and sketch controls are available.
