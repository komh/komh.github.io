<H1>Compiling with International Language Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 225 -->
<P>
The following parameters provide international language support:  /COUNTRY
 =<I> nnn</I>  (where<I> nnn</I> is the 3-digit country code)
<BR>
 /CODEPAGE =<I> nnnn</I>  (where<I> nnnn</I> is the 3 or 4-digit code page)
<BR>
 /LANGUAGE =<I> xxx</I>  (where<I> xxx</I> is a 3-letter identifier that

<BR>
             indicates an international language file is to be used)
<BR>

<P>
An example of the command-line syntax follows:
<PRE>IPFC myfile.txt /INF /COUNTRY=033 /CODEPAGE=437 /LANGUAGE=FRA
</PRE>

<P>
You can now add additional languages to IPFC by providing an IPF<I>xxx</I>.NLS
file where<I> xxx</I> matches the name of the language supplied with the
/LANGUAGE or -L switch.
<P>
You can also add additional code pages by providing an APSY<I>xxxx</I>.APS
file where<I> xxxx</I> matches the number of the code page. Four-digit code
pages are supported. Three-digit code pages have a leading 0 in their APSY<I>xxxx</I>.APS
file name, but the leading 0 does not have to be passed with the /CODEPAGE
or -C switch.  The underlying operating system must support the supplied
code page.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When adding new language or code page files, be sure they
are located in the same subdirectory where your IPFC program files are located.

<P>
The bidirectional version of IPFC.EXE (IPFCBIDI.EXE) is not included as
a separate program with this version of the OS/2 Warp Toolkit. However,
the bidirectional support in IPFCBIDI has been integrated into the American
version of the program, IPFC.EXE.  It will be necessary for you to modify
any makefiles that reference IPFCBIDI.EXE to reference IPFC.EXE instead.
