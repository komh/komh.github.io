<P>
BEEHIVE demonstrates the power of compiled sprites by comparing the performance
of a typical sprite algorithm against a compiled sprite.
<P>
When the application first starts, it will display a single sprite moving
in a random path around the application window. You can add sprites by holding
down the H key. As the sprite count increases, the effects on the frame
rate will become evident. The actual frame rate will be displayed on the
title bar.
<P>
You will be able to switch the application from compiled sprites to normal
sprites using a menu. As the number of sprites increases, the difference
in performance from compiled to normal sprites becomes more dramatic.
<P>
While DIVE offers a high-performance API for blitting images to the screen,
it was not designed for implementing sprites. BEEHIVE demonstrates a technique
for implementing high-performance sprites in an OS/2 Warp/DIVE environment.
The source code provided offers a good starting point for building a high-performance
sprite engine.
