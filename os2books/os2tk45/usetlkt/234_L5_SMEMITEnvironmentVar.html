<H1>SMEMIT Environment Variable</H1><!-- entering slot 237 -->
<P>
SMEMIT is used to indicate which emitter programs should be executed. Like
the SMINCLUDE environment variable it can consist of a list of items separated
by semicolons. Each item designates a particular emitter by the name of
the file extension the emitter produces. The syntax is as follows:
<PRE>SMEMIT=[h;ih;c;xh;xih;xc;def;ir;pdl]
</PRE>

<P>
The default values are<I> h</I> and<I> ih</I>. For example:
<PRE>SET SMEMIT=H;IH;DEF;
</PRE>

<P>
indicates that EMITH.EXE, EMITIH.EXE, and EMITDEF.EXE programs should be
executed to produce .H, .IH, and .DEF files, respectively. By default all
emitted output files are placed in the same directory as the input file.
If the SMEMIT environment variable is not defined, the SOM compiler will
perform a syntax check of your class definition but no output will be produced.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> All command-line modifiers can be set in the environment by
changing them to UPPERCASE and preappending SM to them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
