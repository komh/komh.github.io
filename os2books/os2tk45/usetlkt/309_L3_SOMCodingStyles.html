<H1>SOM Coding Styles</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
There are two possible forms of C bindings for SOM programming:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
SOMCORBA<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> The strict CORBA-compliant form in which
pointer references ('*'s) are NOT exposed in object references.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SOMSTARS
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>The OIDL-compatible C++ form in which pointer references
('*'s) are visible in object references.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The SOMSTARS form is more appropriate if you plan to move your class implementations
from C to C++ at some future point. This choice will determine how object
references will appear in all of your C programs. For example, to declare
a reference to an instance of class Foo, you would code either:
<PRE>  Foo afoo;   /* Strict CORBA compliant form          */  or
  Foo *afoo; /* C++ migration or OIDL-compatible form */
</PRE>

<P>
If you later decide to switch from one SOM coding style to the other, you
will have to convert any C code that you have already written in one style
to the other style.
<P>
The Workplace Shell uses the SOMSTARS version of the SOM header files. Therefore,
the OS/2 Warp Toolkit installs the SOMSTARS version of the header files.

<P>
The Workplace Shell interface definition language (IDL) files (WP*.IDL)
are the counterparts for the documented Workplace Shell classes' SC files
provided with the OS/2 2.1 Toolkit. The WP*.H and WP*.XH files emitted from
the Workplace Shell's IDL files by the SOM compiler are also provided.
<P>
The OS/2 makefiles for the Workplace Shell OS/2 Warp Toolkit samples are
written assuming the SOMSTARS style of coding. The C samples provided with
the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit use the SOMCORBA style of coding (these
samples are not part of the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp).
