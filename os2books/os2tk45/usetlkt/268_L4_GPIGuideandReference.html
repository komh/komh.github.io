<P>
This book describes the concepts associated with graphical output-- presentation
spaces, device contexts, graphic primitives, fonts--and how to prepare graphical
output for display and printing.  It provides the C-language syntax for
all the graphical programming interface (GPI), including input and output
parameters, data structures, data types, return codes, and example codes.
Guidance information is also provided to assist you in developing applications
using these items. GPI functions (indicated by the prefix "Gpi") are listed
in alphabetic order.
