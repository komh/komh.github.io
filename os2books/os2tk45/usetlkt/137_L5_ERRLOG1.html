ERRLOG1 (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\SYSMGT\ERRLOG\ERRLOG1) demonstrates
how to use the following functions to open a file, read an entry from the
log, format that entry, and then close the log.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
LogOpenFile<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogReadEntry<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogFormatEntry<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
LogCloseFile<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The program displays a message indicating whether each function call was
successful or not.
<P>
If the error log is empty, the program will end after the LogReadEntry function
call with a return code of 1750 indicating the end of the file was reached
without finding the desired record.  To have the program run successfully,
run the FFSTProbe sample program (PROBE.EXE) to put an entry in the log.
 PROBE.EXE is located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\SYSMGT\FFST\PROBE subdirectory.
