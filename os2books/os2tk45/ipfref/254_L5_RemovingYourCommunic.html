<H1>Removing Your Communication Object from the Chain</H1><!-- entering slot 268 -->
<P>
Your communication object must be able to remove itself from the chain and
keep the chain intact. When the communication object does remove itself,
it is no longer the active object. This can be carried out as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object must process the WM_DESTROY
message sent by IPF that corresponds to the closure of a window with which
your communication object is associated.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object must query the current
object window using HM_QUERY. This returns the handle of the current object
window.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object can then send the HM_UPDATE_OBJCOM_WINDOW_CHAIN
message to the handle of the current object window including the handle
of your communication object, which was returned when you added your communication
object to the chain (see <A HREF="252_L5_AddingYourCommunicat.html">Adding
Your Communication Object to the Communication Chain</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following code fragment illustrates this process:
<PRE>        case WM_DESTROY:

            hwndPrevious = (HWND) WinQueryWindowULong (hwnd, COM_HWND);

            hwndLatest = (HWND) WinSendMsg (hwnd,
                                     HM_QUERY,
                                     MPFROM2SHORT ((USHORT)0, HMQW_OBJCOM_WINDOW),
                                     NULL);

            WinMessageBox (HWND_DESKTOP,
                           HWND_DESKTOP,
                           (PCH)str,
                           (PCH)"IPF Sample Error Message",
                           1,
                           MB_OK | MB_APPLMODAL |
                           MB_MOVEABLE | MB_ICONASTERISK);
            WinSendMsg (hwndLatest,
                        HM_UPDATE_OBJCOM_WINDOW_CHAIN,
                        (MPARAM) hwndPrevious,
                        (MPARAM) WinQueryWindow (hwnd, QW_PARENT));

            rValue = FALSE;
            break;

        default:

            rValue = TRUE;
            break;

    }
}
