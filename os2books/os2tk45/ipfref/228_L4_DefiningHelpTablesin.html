<H1>Defining Help Tables in Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 239 -->
<P>
By defining help tables and subtables in memory, you can dynamically change
a single entry in the help table. You can add a new window ID to be associated
with a field, or add fields that are to be associated with existing windows.

<P>
After the help table structure is initialized, the application can pass
IPF the address in memory of the new help table, either by sending the HM_CREATE_HELP_TABLE
message from its window procedure, or by calling WinCreateHelpTable.
<P>
When defining help tables in memory, the data structures in PMHELP.H are
used. The help table contains the structure for each application window.
This structure holds the following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Application window ID<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Address of the window's subtable<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window ID of the window's extended help window<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These entries are integers.  The last entry in the list contains a NULL
for each entry type, to indicate the end of the list.  The following is
an example of a help table for an application.
<PRE>HELPSUBTABLE        table1, table2, table3,                    table4, table5;

HELPTABLE     helpTableEntry [] =
{
  APP_WIND_1,  &amp;table1, idExtHelp1,
  APP_WIND_2,  &amp;table2, idExtHelp2,
  APP_WIND_3,  &amp;table3, idExtHelp3,
  APP_WIND_4,  &amp;table4, idExtHelp4,
  APP_WIND_5,  &amp;table5, idExtHelp5,
  0,           NULL,    NULL
};
</PRE>

<P>
The help subtable contains the structure defined in the PMHELP.H file for
each application window. This structure holds the following information
for each field in the application window:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Field ID from which user requests help<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window ID of the contextual help window associated
with the field<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Optional, application-specific integers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The last entry in the structure contains the word length for each field
entry.  The minimum number of words is two, which is the default.  The following
is an example of a help subtable for an application window that has six
fields.
<PRE>HELPSUBTABLE        HelpSubTable [] ={
  2,
  FIELD_ID_1, IDRES_HELP1,
  FIELD_ID_2, IDRES_HELP2,
  FIELD_ID_3, IDRES_HELP3,
  FIELD_ID_4, IDRES_HELP4,
  FIELD_ID_5, IDRES_HELP5,
  FIELD_ID_6, IDRES_HELP6,
  0,          0
};
</PRE>
