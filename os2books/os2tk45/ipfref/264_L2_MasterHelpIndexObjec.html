<H1>Master Help Index Objects and Glossary Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 281 -->
<P>
The OS/2 operating system's online documentation includes two Workplace
Shell user objects that correspond to a single Workplace Shell software
class object. The "Master Help Index" user object and the "Glossary" user
object are instances of the "Mindex" object class. With the Master Help
Index and the Glossary, users can access online help panels which include
the<B> global</B> attribute in their index tagging (for more information,
see <A HREF="077_L3_CustomizingMasterHel.html">Customizing Master Help Index
and Glossary Objects</A>). Note that this object class only works with online
help (.HLP files), not online information (.INF files).
<P>
The Mindex class is a member of the WPAbstract class, which is, in turn,
a member of the root WPObject class. All of the WPObject classes are easily
accessed and instantiated through the "WP Class List", provided as one of
the PM Development Tools in the<I> IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2</I>.
For additional information about manipulating Mindex class user objects
in the Workplace Shell (such as copying and shadowing) see <A HREF="077_L3_CustomizingMasterHel.html">Customizing
Master Help Index and Glossary Objects</A>.
<P>
There are three task scenarios involving Mindex class objects of particular
interest to a programmer:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Adding index entries to the Master Help Index
user object at installation time.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Adding index entries to the Glossary user object
at installation time.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Instantiating a new Mindex class object with
an application. For example, creating a product-specific master index user
object during the installation of your application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These tasks can be done with minimal programming effort.
