margin=<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Enables you to indicate the number of character
spaces from the right border of the window the text is to end. For example,
<B>margin=60</B> means that the text is to end 60 spaces from the right
border.
<P>

average character widths.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Description</B>
<P>
Use<B> :rm.</B> with the left-margin tag (<B>:lm.</B>) to specify the boundaries
of the text in the window. The left-margin tag specifies where the text
is to start, and the right-margin tag specifies where it is to end.
<P>
You can enter margin tags at the beginning of the line of text or while
you are entering the text. Margin tags that begin the line of text cause
text on that line and the following lines to align with the values specified.
Margins set while you enter text become effective on the current line or
on the next line, depending on where the margin tag begins. For example,
to set the right margin to 60 (that is, 60 spaces before the right border
of the window), begin the right-margin tag at least 60 spaces to the left
of the right border. When the file is displayed, the text entered after
the margin tag aligns to the value specified on that line.
<P>
If the margin tag is started after the specified boundary, the margin becomes
effective on the next line.
<P>
When the text window is sized, the text area adjusts from the right to fit
within the specified margin boundaries; that is, the right margin adjusts
to the window size. The left margin stays the same. If the window is sized
smaller than the specified margins, the margins remain the same, and the
text area is reduced to one character space. If no value is specified for
<B>margin=</B>, the default for the right margin is 1.
<P>
You can place multiple margin tags in your file. The specified margins remain
effective until they are reset.

<B>Example</B>
<P>

<PRE><B>:lm margin=</B>1.<B>:rm margin=</B>44.
:p.In this example, the left margin is 1.  The right
margin is 44.  The margins are set before the text;
therefore, when the file is displayed, the text
formats according to the margins set.
The text begins at space 2 and ends 44 spaces before
the right window border.  If the margin specified is
less than the current cursor position on the screen,
the margins set become effective on the following
line.  For example, if the current cursor position is
60 spaces to the left of the right window border and
you set the right margin to 50, the margin is
effective on the current line.  However, if the right
margin is set to 65, the margin becomes effective
on the next line.
:p.
<B>:lm margin=</B>5.
<B>:rm margin=</B>60.Here the left margin is set to 5
and the right margin is set to 60.  This means that
the left margin begins 5 spaces to the right of the
left border.  The right margin ends 60 spaces to the
left of the right border.

<B>Output</B>
<P>
In this example, the left margin is 1.  The right
<BR>
margin is 44.  The margins are set before the
<BR>
text; therefore, when the file is displayed, the text
<BR>
formats according to the margins set.  The text
<BR>
begins at space 2 and ends 44 spaces before the
<BR>
right window border.  If the margin specified is
<BR>
less than the current cursor position on the
<BR>
screen, the margins set become effective on the
<BR>
following line.  For example, if the current cursor
<BR>
position is 60 spaces to the left of the right
<BR>
window border and you set the right margin to 50,
<BR>
the margin is effective on the current line.
<BR>
However, if the right margin is set to 65, the
<BR>
margin becomes effective on the next line.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
   Here the left margin is set to 5
<BR>
   and the right margin is set to
<BR>
   60.  This means that the left
<BR>
   margin begins 5 spaces to the
<BR>
   right of the left border.  The
<BR>
   right margin ends 60 spaces to
<BR>
   the left of the right border.
