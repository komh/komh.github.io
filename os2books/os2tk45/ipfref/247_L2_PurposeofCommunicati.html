<P>
Communication objects can provide several powerful capabilities:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You can write PM code that handles and responds to
help-related messages. For this, you would use a<B> :docprof.</B>-loaded
"global" communication object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You can write PM code to override the default appearance
of the IPF help interface.  For example, you can provide custom push buttons
in the control area. For this, you would use a<B> :docprof.</B>-loaded "global"
communication object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You can write PM code that allows help information
to include function simulation, user interaction, and audio and video presentations
(see <A HREF="256_L1_ControllingWindowswi.html">Controlling Windows with
Applications (ACVIEWPORTS)</A>). For this, you would use an<B> :acviewport.</B>-loaded
communication object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You can write PM code that changes help information
(including .INF files) dynamically, with help window contents generated
and formatted at the time when the information is displayed to the user.
For this, you would use a<B> :docprof.</B>-loaded or "global" communication
object. For more information about changing help information dynamically,
see <A HREF="259_L1_ChangingHelpInformat.html">Changing Help Information
at Run Time (DDF)</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Essentially, a communication object is intended to provide message processing
when no application is present to handle this message processing. In other
words, your stand-alone PM applications can provide the same functionality
that is supported by communication objects.
<P>
However, unlike a stand-alone application, a communication object that properly
handles message passing can be used by any stand-alone application and can
interact with other communication objects. For example, a communication
object that provides system call support (such as querying specific details
about the user's system) might be useful to a broad range of applications
in their online information.
