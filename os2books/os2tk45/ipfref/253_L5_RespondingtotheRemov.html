<H1>Responding to the Removal of Another Object in the Chain</H1><!-- entering slot 266 -->
<P>
If a communication object that was added to the chain before your communication
object removes itself from the chain, your communication object must respond
to keep the chain intact.
<P>
This involves several steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object must process the HM_UPDATE_OBJCOM_WINDOW_CHAIN
help manager message. This message provides your communication object with:
<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The handle of the communication object that is
removing itself from the chain.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL>  b.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The
window handle for the object to serve as a replacement in the chain.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Your
communication object does not need to respond unless the first parameter,
the handle of the communication object removing itself, is identical to
the handle returned to your communication object when it initially sent
a HM_SET_OBJCOM_WINDOW message to add itself to the chain (see <A HREF="252_L5_AddingYourCommunicat.html">Adding
Your Communication Object to the Communication Chain</A>). Your communication
object should have stored this handle.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
the second parameter returned by HM_UPDATE_OBJCOM_WINDOW_CHAIN does not
match the handle previously returned by HM_SET_OBJCOM_WINDOW, your communication
object is not affected by the modification to the chain and does not need
to respond other than to pass on the message to the next communication object
in the chain.
<P>
However, if these handles are identical, your communication object has a
new "neighbor" in the chain, and should begin passing all HM_ help manager
messages to the object identified by the handle returned as the first parameter
of HM_UPDATE_OBJCOM_WINDOW_CHAIN.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
