<H1>Processing "Using help" Requests</H1><!-- entering slot 247 -->
<P>
When the user selects "Using help" from the help pull-down menu, a WM_COMMAND
is sent to the application's window procedure.
<P>
If the application has created its own "Using help" window, it responds
by sending the HM_REPLACE_USING_HELP message with the help-window ID.  If
the application chooses to use the "Using help" window provided by IPF,
it responds by sending the HM_DISPLAY_HELP with NULL in both parameters.

<P>
Current CUA guidelines recommend applications use "Using help"; however,
IPF continues to support the "Help for help" window.
