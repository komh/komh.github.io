<H1>The Communication Chain</H1><!-- entering slot 262 -->
<P>
Communication objects, whether they are loaded by means of a<B> :docprof.
</B>tag or an<B> :acviewport.</B> tag, function in a "communication chain."
The chain is maintained through the passing of HM_ messages unidirectionally
through the chain.
<P>
<B>IPF passes all messages to the active communication object</B> (including,
but not limited to, HM_ messages) as they are generated by the user's actions.
The active communication object is then responsible for passing on any HM_
messages it receives through the chain to a neighboring communication object.
The handle of the neighboring communication object window is returned by
the HM_SET_OBJCOM_WINDOW (see <A HREF="252_L5_AddingYourCommunicat.html">Adding
Your Communication Object to the Communication Chain</A>).
<P>
Even if you are certain that your communication object will not be used
in combination with other communication objects, it is your responsibility
to code your communication object contingent on the possibility that other
communication objects may be present in the chain. Therefore, it is important
for you to create communication objects that keep the communication chain
intact through message passing.
