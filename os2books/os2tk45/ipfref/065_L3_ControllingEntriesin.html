<H1>Controlling Entries in the Contents Window</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
The following example shows some tagging that will control what entries
appear in the Contents window, as well as what headings will start windows.

<PRE><B>:userdoc.</B>
<B>:docprof toc=</B>12.
<B>:h1.</B>Heading Levels
<B>:h2.</B>Second-Level Heading
<B>:p.</B>
This window is defined by a heading-level 2 tag.
<B>:h2.</B>Second-Level Heading
<B>:p.</B>
This window also is defined by a heading-level 2 tag.
<B>:p.</B>
<B>:h3.</B>Third-Level Heading
<B>:p.</B>
Because the &amp;colon.docprof. tag at the beginning of the file
specifies that only heading levels 1 and 2 can be entries in the
Contents window (toc=12), the preceding "Third-Level Heading"
and THIS text, which follows it, become part of the
window defined by the preceding heading-level 2 tag.
<B>:h2</B> <B>toc=</B>123.Another Second-Level Heading
<B>:p.</B>
The heading-level 2 tag for this window contains
a toc=123 specification.
<B>:h3.</B>Third-Level Heading
<B>:p.</B>
Because the toc=123 in the preceding heading-level 2
tag overrides the toc=12 in the &amp;colon.docprof. tag, this
heading-level 3 tag defines a new window and creates a
Contents entry.
<B>:euserdoc.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Unless otherwise specified, the default set of heading tags that create
entries in the Contents window and define the start of windows are<B> :h1.</B>,
<B>:h2.</B>, and<B> :h3.</B>. To change this default, specify a numeric
sequence with the table of content attribute (<B>toc=</B>) of the<B> :docprof.
</B>tag. The<B> :docprof.</B> tag controls the heading levels displayed
in the Contents window. The sequence must begin with level 1 and cannot
skip a level in the descending hierarchy. For example, the<B> :h4.</B>,
<B>:h5.</B> and<B> :h6.</B> tags do not start separate windows, but control
the appearance of the text of the window unless you specify:
<PRE><B>:docprof toc=</B>123456.
</PRE>

<P>
To specify that only heading levels 1 and 2 are to define windows and appear
as entries in the Contents window, the following tag was used:
<PRE><B>:docprof toc=</B>12.
</PRE>

<P>
The value specified for the<B> toc=</B> attribute remains in effect for
all the heading definitions in the file.  You can override it by specifying
another value for the<B> toc=</B> attribute in a heading definition. The
new value is then in effect for the rest of the headings in the file, or
until overridden in another heading definition.
<P>
In the preceding example, the<B> toc=</B> attribute of the<B> :docprof.
</B>tag is overridden by the<B> toc=</B> attribute of a heading tag.
<P>
The next example shows the results of the tagging. Notice the effect of
including a heading level that is lower in the hierarchy than the range
of heading levels specified with the<B> :docprof.</B> tag.

When the file is viewed, the<B> :h3.</B> title and the text following it
are included as part of the window defined by the preceding<B> :h2.</B> tag.
