<P>
Push buttons provide users with a fast and easy way to access commonly used
IPF tasks.  When a user selects a push button, the action represented by
the text on the push button is carried out immediately.  IPF provides one
set of push buttons for online documents and another set for Help windows.
 IPF also provides help on how to use the push buttons.
<P>
As a designer, you can change the text of a push button, select which push
buttons you want to use, add your own push buttons, and specify the area
of a window to place them.  For more information, see <A HREF="067_L2_PushButtons.html">Push
Buttons</A>.
