<P>
Windows can be considered to be subdivisions of the screen. They can be
either primary or secondary windows. A primary window is where the main
topic appears, or where the interaction between a user and an object or
application takes place. A secondary window usually supplements the information
in the primary window. It is closed when its primary window is closed. The
following figure shows a simple multiple-window design with a primary and
secondary window.

<P>
To create the two-window format shown in the figure, you must define the
size of each window, then position them within the boundaries of the coverpage
window. When defining window size, you specify horizontal and vertical areas
of the window, using window coordinates.
