<H1>Command Entry Field</H1><!-- entering slot 254 -->
<P>
An entry field is a control window that enables users to enter text. A command
entry field is used for typing commands, and may be programmed to accept
entries recognized by the application.
<P>
For example, a command entry field might be used in an interpreter with
a Presentation Manager interface.  The field would accept a request from
the user and execute it.  Similarly, a command entry field might be used
in an editor in a "command mode" to accept advanced instructions not associated
with any editing keys.  Any time the user has a limited number of correct
responses, a command entry field may be appropriate.
<P>
Help windows for application commands can be associated with a command entry
field by imbedding the index command tag (<B>:icmd.</B>) with a command
name in the window that describes the command.
<P>
When the cursor is positioned in the associated entry field and the user
presses F1 or selects the<B> Help</B> push button, titles of windows that
contain these tags are displayed in alphabetic order in a list box window.
