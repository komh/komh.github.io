<H1>Enabling Help for Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 236 -->
<P>
While running an application the user sometimes requires help.  For example,
the user may need assistance in making a choice, recalling the name of an
application command or the use of a function key, or locating information.

<P>
Using IPF, you can develop a user interface that provides general help for
application windows, and contextual help for fields within windows.
<P>
Implementing the IPF user interface when creating helps for an application
requires two different development efforts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Developing the programming code that communicates
with IPF and the Presentation Manager to display help windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Developing a library of help information that IPF
refers to in response to a user request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This section will concentrate on the first development effort:  writing
the programming code that enables communication between IPF and the Presentation
Manager.
