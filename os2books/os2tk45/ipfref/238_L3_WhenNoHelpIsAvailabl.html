<P>
A user may request help by pressing F1 when the cursor is positioned on
an item for which no field-level help is available. In such a case, IPF
sends the HM_HELPSUBITEM_NOT_FOUND message to the application.  To display
the extended help window, the application then can either return FALSE or
ignore the message.  If the application returns TRUE, there is no response
to the user request.
