<H1>Margins</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
You can specify the boundaries of text in a window by using the margin tags.
 The left-margin tag (<B>:lm.</B>) specifies how many character spaces from
the left border of the window the text is to start.  The right-margin tag
(<B>:rm.</B>) specifies how many character spaces from the right border
the text is to end.
<P>
The<B> margin=</B> attribute sets the margin for the text. If none is specified
on the<B> :lm.</B> or<B> :rm.</B> tag, the default is 1.
<P>
If the margin tag in a line begins beyond the specified boundary, the new
margin becomes effective on the next line.
<P>
You can have multiple margin tags in your file. The specified margins remain
in effect until they are reset.

<B>Input Example</B>
<P>

<PRE>:p.
<B>:rm margin=</B>10.
<B>:lm margin=</B>20.This text begins 20 spaces to the right
of the left window border and ends 10 spaces to the
left of the right window border.
All text is aligned as specified
by the margin values. <B>:lm margin=</B>5.Here the left margin
is changed to 5.  Because this margin tag begins
more than 5 spaces on the line, the margin specified
becomes effective on the following line, and the text
begins 5 spaces from the left window border.
The right margin remains unchanged.
</PRE>

<P>
Here is how the window looks:
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>This text begins 20 spaces to the right of the left
window border and ends 10 spaces to the left of the right window border.
All text is aligned as specified by the margin values.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --> Here
the left margin is changed to 5.  Because this margin tag begins more than
5 spaces on the line, the margin specified becomes effective on the following
line, and the text begins 5 spaces from the left window border. The right
margin remains unchanged.
