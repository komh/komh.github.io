<H1>Attribute Values with Blank Spaces</H1><!-- entering slot 60 -->
<P>
If an attribute value includes blank spaces, the value must be enclosed
in single quotes.  For example:
<PRE><B>:font facename=</B>'Tms Rmn'.
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that the value has initial capitals.  For this particular case, they
are required; otherwise, the IPF compiler will not recognize them as valid
values.
<P>
Using some of the tags described thus far, you could produce a source file
like this:
<PRE><B>:userdoc.</B>
<B>:h1 res=001.</B>Save the Manatee
<B>:p.</B>
There are fewer than 1200 manatees in the state of Florida.
Ten percent of the existing herds die each year
because of:
<B>:sl compact.</B>
<B>:li.</B>Contact with boat propellers
<B>:li.</B>Impact from boats and barges
<B>:li.</B>Entrapment in locks and dams.
<B>:esl.</B>
<B>:euserdoc.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
The output produced from the source file is an OS/2 standard window.
<P>
The menu-bar choices,<B> Services, Options,</B> and<B> Help</B> are provided
automatically by IPF. The title-bar line, "Save the Manatee," is generated
by the<B> :h1.</B> tag. The viewing area of the window displays the formatted
information.
