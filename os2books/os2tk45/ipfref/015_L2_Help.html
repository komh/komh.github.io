<H1>Help</H1><!-- entering slot 15 -->While using an online document or application program,
a user occasionally requires additional information about choices, fields,
or procedures for a task. CUA guidelines recommend that a product provide
information to a user about how to use the product. Information about how
to use a product is known as help information. The OS/2 user interface for
help information is developed with IPF and is accessible from the menu bar.
 Help can also be accessed from push buttons located at the bottom of the
window or by pressing the F1 key.
