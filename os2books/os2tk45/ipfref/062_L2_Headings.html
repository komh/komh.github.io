Perhaps the most versatile tag is the heading tag. Heading tags enable information
to be displayed in windows, control entries in the Contents window, control
placement of push buttons in a window, and define the shape and size of
windows. With IPF, you can specify six levels of headings,<B> :h1</B> through
<B>:h6</B>.  For information about default heading levels that start a window
and place entries in the table of contents window, see the following topic
on Controlling Entries in the Contents Window.
