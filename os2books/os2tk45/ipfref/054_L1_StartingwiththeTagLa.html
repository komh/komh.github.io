<P>
As the author of online information, you can use the IPF tag language to
define various characteristics of text format. You also can use tags to
define characteristics of the window in which the text is displayed.
<P>
There are 45 tags (excluding symbols) that make up the IPF tag language.
 The tags are<I> mnemonic</I>, making it easy to associate them with their
functions. However, before you can begin to use this language, you need
to familiarize yourself with the elements that make up the syntax of the
tags, and special rules that govern the use of the tags.
