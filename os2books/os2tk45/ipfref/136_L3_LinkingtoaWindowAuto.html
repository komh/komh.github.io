<H1>Linking to a Window Automatically</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
As we have seen, one way to display a secondary window is to enable the
user to select a hypertext link from one window to another. Another way
is to link the user to the secondary window automatically. For example,
in the following figure the window on the right is displayed automatically
when the user selects the window on the left (perhaps from the Contents
window).
