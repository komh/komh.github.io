<P>
DDF data is treated differently for a help and an online document. In the
case of a help facility, the HM_QUERY_DDF_DATA message must be processed
in the application's window procedure. Within the processing for this message,
you can turn on the number specified in the<B> res=</B> attribute of the
<B>:ddf.</B> tag to allow for different processing based on which IPF window
with a<B> :ddf.</B> tag is currently being displayed.
<P>
Therefore, in the case of dynamic data formatting within help, it is not
necessary to specify an application-controlled window or a separate DLL.
 However, this would also work if the application-controlled window used
the HM_SET_OBJCOM_WINDOW message to explicitly identify the entry point
specified in the<B> dll=' '</B> and<B> objectname=' '</B> attributes of
the<B> :acviewport.</B> tag as the proper window procedure where the HM_QUERY_DDF_DATA
message is processed.
