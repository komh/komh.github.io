<P>
In order to provide help, the application must associate an instance of
the Help Manager with a chain of application windows. This association lets
the Help Manager know which instance should provide the help function.
<P>
The Help Manager traces the window chain, starting from the window where
help is requested. The application window in the chain with the associated
help instance will be the one with which the Help Manager communicates and
next to which the help window is positioned, unless a <A HREF="706_L2_HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW.html">HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
</A>message is sent to the Help Manager. If the <A HREF="706_L2_HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW.html">HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
</A>message is sent to the Help Manager, the active window parameter is
the window with which the Help Manager communicates. The Help Manager positions
the help window next to the window specified as the relative window.
