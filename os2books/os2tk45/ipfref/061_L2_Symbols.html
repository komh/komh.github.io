<P>
You use symbols to produce characters that cannot be entered from the keyboard.
A symbol begins with an ampersand (&amp;) and is followed by the symbol
name and a period.  For example, to produce a square bullet, which looks
like this:
<PRE>â– 
</PRE>
Enter the symbol like this:
<PRE><B>&amp;sqbul.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If you want the ampersand character (&amp;) to appear in text, define it
as the symbol,<B>  &amp;amp</B>.  Otherwise, the IPF compiler tries to interpret
whatever text follows the ampersand character as the name of a symbol, and
will return the error message, Invalid symbol.
<P>
Symbols are case-sensitive.  That is, if you do not type them exactly as
the appear in the symbols table (see <A HREF="219_L1_Symbols.html">Symbols</A>)
you could get either the message, Invalid Symbol, or a symbol different
from the one you want.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The symbols table is also available online when you install
the Online Information component of the Developer's Toolkit for OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
