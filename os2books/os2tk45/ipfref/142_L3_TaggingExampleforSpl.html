<H1>Tagging Example for Split Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 143 -->The following tagging examples show the tagging
for two different split-window arrangements.
<P>
In the first example, "Primary Window A" (<B>res=016</B>) has automatic
links to two secondary windows, (<B>res=017</B> and<B> res=018</B>).  The
tagging for<B> res=017</B> has two list items, each of which is a hypertext
link.  The first list item, "Ducks," links to<B> res=018</B>; the second
item, "World," links to<B> res=019</B>.
<P>
The tagging for both<B> res=018</B> and<B> res=019</B> refer to bit-map
files.
<P>
Notice that in "Primary Window A" the link tags for the secondary windows
specify<B> titlebar=none</B>, but the heading tags for the secondary windows
specify "Dummy" as title text.  You must always provide IPF with a title
string in a heading tag, even when you specify that the window will not
have a title bar and will not have an entry in the Contents window because
you have specified the<B> hide</B> attribute. The link tags for a hypertext
link to a secondary window must specify the<B> split</B> attribute. If the
<B>split</B> attribute is omitted, the window will not behave as a secondary
window; that is, it will not close when the primary window is closed, and
instead of moving when the primary window is moved, it will become obscured.
