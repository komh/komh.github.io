<H1>Controlling Windows with Applications (ACVIEWPORTS)</H1><!-- entering slot 270 -->
<P>
IPF handles the formatting and display of text and graphic information within
its windows.<I> IPF-controlled</I> windows are defined in the tagged source
file with a heading tag or<B> :link.</B>. These windows are IPF-controlled
because IPF provides the window procedures that control them. The content
and presentation of information in an IPF-controlled window is limited by
the functions of a standard OS/2 window.
<P>
To create IPF-controlled windows, an author requires only tagging skills;
however, to create<I> application-controlled</I> windows, an author requires
both tagging and programming skills.
<P>
Application-controlled windows are defined in the tagged source file with
the application-controlled window tag (<B>:acviewport.</B>). With this tag,
a window is controlled by a communication object (see <A HREF="244_L1_CustomizingIPFwithCo.html">Customizing
IPF with Communication Objects</A>) that has been written and compiled into
the form of a dynamic link library (DLL). When an IPF window is displayed
at execution time and<B> :acviewport.</B> is encountered, IPF passes control
to the entry point in the DLL specified by the<B> objectname=' '</B> attribute
of<B> :acviewport.</B>. This entry point is, in fact, a communication object.

<P>
At this point, the communication object takes control and executes the instructions
specified in the source file. When the call returns to IPF, IPF sizes and
positions the window on the screen as defined in the heading tag or<B> :link.
</B>(see <A HREF="123_L1_CustomizingWindows.html">Customizing Windows</A>).

<P>
The<B> :acviewport</B> tag can share a panel with text and, for that matter,
you can have more than one<B> :acviewport</B> tag in the same panel.
<P>
In addition, an acviewport communication object can be called from more
than one panel. The<B> objectid=</B> attribute enables the communication
object to determine which help panel called it.
<P>
The following figure shows the tagging to produce a split window.  In this
example, the contents of the left window are IPF-controlled.  The contents
of the right window are defined and controlled by the IPF communication
object<B> IPFMain</B> which resides in IPF.DLL.

<P>
The following figure shows the compiled version of the tagging shown in
the previous figure.
<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="256_L1_ControllingWindowswi_35.gif" WIDTH=623 HEIGHT=418>
<P>
The left window is IPF-controlled. The right window displays an animated
mouse whose activity is controlled by a routine in a DLL.
<P>

<P>
In the previous example, IPF processes<B> :acviewport.</B> as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->It loads IPF.DLL and calls the procedure IPFMain.
 This object name is case sensitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->IPFMain creates a window and registers it with
IPF as an object communication window.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the call to IPFMain returns to IPF, IPF
gives instructions to display the animated mouse.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
IPFMain, IPF.DLL, and the bit maps used for the animated mouse are provided
in the IPF sample program available with the Toolkit.
