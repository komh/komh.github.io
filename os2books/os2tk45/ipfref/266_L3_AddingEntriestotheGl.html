<H1>Adding Entries to the Glossary at Installation</H1><!-- entering slot 283 -->
<P>
Because both the Glossary and the Master Help Index user objects are simply
Mindex class software objects, the manner in which you add entries to the
Glossary is identical to the manner in which you add entries to the Master
Help Index (see <A HREF="265_L3_AddingEntriestotheMa.html">Adding Entries
to the Master Help Index at Installation</A>). However, if you check the
default Settings Notebook for the Glossary user object, you will notice
that the Glossary installed with the OS/2 operating has a default "Files/Environment
name(s)" that is not set to the "HELP" environment variable. Rather, it
is set to the "GLOSSARY" environment variable. Therefore, you can update
the value of this variable in CONFIG.SYS to reflect the location of your
.HLP files that contain<B> global</B> tagged index entries. Alternatively,
you can simply copy your .HLP files to the path defined by the GLOBAL environment
variable. The default value is:
<PRE>GLOSSARY=C:\OS2\HELP\GLOSS;
</PRE>
