<P>
Each tag must start with a colon (:) and end with a period (.). (The period
is also known as a<I> delimiter</I>.) For example, the tag for a paragraph
is:
<PRE><B>:p.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
A tag indicates how the text that immediately follows it is to be processed.
In the following example, the text immediately after the paragraph tag (<B>:p.</B>)
is the actual text that is displayed in the window, and it will begin a
new paragraph.
<PRE><B>:p.</B>There are fewer than 1200 manatees...
</PRE>
