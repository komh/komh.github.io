<P>
A<I> metafile</I> is another type of file in which graphics are stored.
However, a metafile contains data generated from the Presentation Manager
graphics (GPI) functions only. (For information about graphics functions,
see the OS/2 2.0<I> Programming Guide</I>, Volume 3.)  IPF supports a metafile
as a hypergraphic link only when the entire metafile is defined as a hypergraphic
area.
<P>
The artwork tag identifies the file name of a metafile as follows:
<PRE><B>:artwork name=</B>'myfile.met'.
