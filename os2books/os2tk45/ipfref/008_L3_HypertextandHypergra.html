<H1>Hypertext and Hypergraphic Links</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
IPF gives the user the ability to connect to different units of text and
graphics. The connections that join these units are known as hypertext or
hypergraphic links.  For example, a user can select a particular link to
obtain related information or perhaps to see a graphical description of
the topic.
<P>
An advantage of using hypertext or hypergraphic links is that the author
can present information in a nonlinear way. Users can then access information
both sequentially and randomly. This lets them explore or branch into subject
matter that may be unclear or that needs to be reviewed.  For information
about hypertext and hypergraphic links, see <A HREF="106_L1_Linking.html">Linking</A>.
