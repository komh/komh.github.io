Links are electronic connections between one online element and another.
 With IPF, the user can be linked from one window to another by means of
selectable text and graphic areas that the author defines.  The user also
can be linked to information in another IPF database.

Different types of links support document designs and information retrievability
in various ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
