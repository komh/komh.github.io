<H1>DDF and Online Documents</H1><!-- entering slot 277 -->
<P>
The situation is different with an online document (as in, filetype INF).
To display DDF data in an online document, the<B> :ddf.</B> tag must be
specified within an application-controlled window. The window that actually
specifies the<B> :ddf.</B> tag must be defined as a LINK AUTO SPLIT of the
application-controlled window's parent window that is specified with a heading
tag. The reason is based on the serialization sequence when IPF reads an
.INF source file. For example, suppose the file is tagged as follows:
<PRE><B>:h1 res=</B>100 x=0 y=0 width=50% height=50%.DDF Parent
<B>:acviewport dll='</B>test.dll<B>' objectname='</B>someobject<B>' objectid='</B>1<B>'</B>.
<B>:ddf res=</B>100.
</PRE>

<P>
The HM_QUERY_DDF_DATA message will be sent to the window procedure of VIEW,
which does not process it, and it will be lost. However, suppose the tagging
sequence is as follows:
<PRE><B>:h1 res=</B>100 x=left y=top width=100% height=100% titlebar=both clear.Look here first
<B>:acviewport dll='</B>flight<B>' objectname='</B>GetName<B>' objectid='</B>2<B>'</B>.
<B>:link reftype=hd refid=</B>ddf1 <B>auto split.</B>
<B>:h1 id=</B>ddf1 x=50% y=top width=50% height=100% hide.ddf1
<B>:ddf res=</B>100.
</PRE>

<P>
The HM_QUERY_DDF_DATA message will be sent to the "GetName" window procedure,
which can initialize and process the DDF data. Therefore, to incorporate
DDF data in an online document, you must write a DLL to handle the processing.
This DLL must be a global communication object. (That is, docproof-loaded)

<P>
The other DDF message is the HM_INVALIDATE_DDF_DATA.  This message is sent
by the application and informs IPF that previous dynamic data formatting
(DDF) information is no longer valid.
