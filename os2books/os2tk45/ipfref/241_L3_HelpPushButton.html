<H1>Help Push Button</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
If your application has a dialog or message area, you may want to include
the Help push button in the bottom area of the secondary application window
(dialog box). To define the Help push button, use the Presentation Manager
button style BS_HELP and BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS.
<P>
The BS_HELP style causes the Presentation Manager to call IPF when the user
selects this Help push button. The BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS style enables the Presentation
Manager to determine the field for which the user requested help.
