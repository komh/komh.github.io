<H1>Processing Help Requests for a Child Window</H1><!-- entering slot 249 -->
<P>
In the Presentation Manager, parent and child windows are active at the
same time.  Therefore, when a help instance is associated with a window,
its descendants are included in the association.  However, only the parent
window is the active help window.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Do not confuse child windows with dialog, message boxes, and
other windows which the application may own but are actually children of
the desktop.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
For IPF to process help requests for a child window, an application must
send IPF HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages to set the active help window.  Until
this happens, IPF continues to satisfy help requests for the child window
from the help subtable for the parent window.
<P>
The HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message should be sent by ALL windows in response
to the WM_ACTIVATE and WM_INITMENU messages as shown in the following example.

         /*
          * Clear active help window when this window is
          * deactivated - necessary for message box help, etc.
          * to work properly.

                     HM_SET_ACTIVE_WINDOW,
                     NULL,
                     NULL );
      }
      break;

   case WM_INITMENU:
      /*
       * Set active window to this window's parent here so that
       * the menu id will be found in the proper subtable.
       * Activation and deactivation of the help window will
       * take care of setting the help window back to the
       * active window.
