<H1>Useful Communication Object Terminology</H1><!-- entering slot 257 -->
<P>
Before you begin reading about how to create IPF communication objects and
related topics (such as application-controlled windows), you need to be
familiar with the terms which will be used to describe them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
acviewport<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The<B> :acviewport.</B> tag, which enables
an application to control what is displayed in an IPF window (see <A HREF="176_L2_acviewportApplicatio.html">:acviewport.
(Application-Controlled Window)</A>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> application-controlled
window<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The window that you create using a communication
object that is loaded by an<B> :acviewport.</B> tag.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> communication
object<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> A child window of the object window; this
child window can handle and respond to messages (particularly HM_ messages).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>DLL<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> A dynamic link library
(DLL) is a collection of executable programming code and data that is bound
to an application at load time or run time, rather than during linking.
The programming code and data in a DLL can be shared by several applications
simultaneously.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> entry point<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> A
function called in the DLL that contains your communication object. Specified
in the<B> :acviewport.</B> tag with the<B> objectname</B> option.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> object
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>For the purposes of this discussion, synonymous
