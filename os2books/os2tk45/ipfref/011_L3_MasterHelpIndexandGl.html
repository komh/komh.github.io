<P>
The OS/2 operating system provides online help that can be accessed through
both a Master Help Index and a Glossary. The Master Help Index and the Glossary
are both collections of alphabetized pointers to information panels. Their
primary purpose is to provide quick access to help topics. With them, you
can provide such features as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

in the WorkPlace Shell<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
