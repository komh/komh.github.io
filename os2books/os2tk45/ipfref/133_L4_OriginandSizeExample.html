<P>
The example of a source file shown in the following figure defines two windows.
 The origin and size attributes specified with the heading definitions place
the windows adjacent to one another on the screen.
<PRE><B>:h1.</B>Origin and Size Window Example
<B>:h2 res=</B>003
    <B>x=</B>left <B>y=</B>bottom
    <B>width=</B>50% <B>height=</B>100%.

<B>:p.</B>
Here is the text for the primary window.  This is a
<B>:link reftype=hd res=</B>004.

<B>:elink.</B>
to the secondary window.
<B>:h2 res=</B>004
    <B>x=</B>right <B>y=</B>bottom
    <B>width=</B>50% <B>height=</B>100%.

</PRE>

<P>
The origin of the first window is the lower left-hand corner of the coverpage
window.  It occupies 50% of the width, but 100% of the height of the coverpage
window on the left-hand side.
<P>
The origin of the second window is the lower right-hand corner of the coverpage
window.  It occupies 50% of the width, but 100% of the height of the coverpage
window on the right-hand side.
<P>
 Although these two windows occupy adjacent positions on the screen, you
cannot display them both at the same time. To define separate windows, you
must specify a<I> group</I> number in the heading definition.
