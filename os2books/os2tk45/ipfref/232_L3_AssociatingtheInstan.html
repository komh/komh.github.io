<H1>Associating the Instance with the Window Chain</H1><!-- entering slot 244 -->
<P>
After an application creates a help instance, it must associate the instance
with the application window chain by calling WinAssociateHelpInstance. IPF
uses the active window handle passed by this call to index into the help
table to find the help window that should be displayed for the application
window.
<P>
An IPF instance can be associated with any application window that has a
frame. Once the association of an IPF instance with the application window
chain is made, help can be requested for any application window in the chain.

<P>
The following shows how a help instance is associated with the application
window chain.
<PRE>   /*  associate the help instance with the main frame  */
   if (!WinAssociateHelpInstance (hwndHelpInstance, hwndFrame))
   {
   MessageBox (hwndFrame,
         IDS_HELPLOADERROR,
         MB_OK | MB_ERROR,
         TRUE);
   return;
   }

   /*  IPF is successfully initialized; set flag to TRUE  */
   fHelpEnabled = TRUE;

</PRE>
