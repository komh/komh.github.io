<H1>Two Kinds of Communication Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 258 -->
<P>
How the communication object is loaded into memory is an indication of the
purpose of the communication object. A DLL containing a communication object
can be loaded into memory in two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Through use of the<B> :docprof.</B> tag's<B> dll
</B>attribute (see <A HREF="186_L2_docprofDocumentProfi.html">:docprof.
 (Document Profile)</A>). A communication object loaded through the<B> :docprof.
</B>tag is considered a "global" communication object because it affects
the IPF coverpage window and all of its children IPF windows. Essentially,
a<B> :docprof.</B>-loaded communication object can alter the overall behavior
and appearance of IPF, such as providing author-defined buttons in the control
area or special message handling. You can load only one communication object
in this manner.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Through use of the<B> :acviewport.</B> tags (see
<A HREF="176_L2_acviewportApplicatio.html">:acviewport. (Application-Controlled
Window)</A>). A communication object loaded in this way will only affect
the specific application-controlled window and only when that window is
open. Therefore, a communication object loaded through an<B> :acviewport.
</B>tag is useful for tasks such as displaying video clips or bit maps associated
with a given help panel. However, if you want a communication object to
affect the overall appearance or behavior of the IPF interface for a given
help session, you will want to use a "global" communication object (one
that is loaded through the<B> :docprof.</B> tag). Unlike a global communication
object, you can load multiple<B> :acviewport.</B> communication objects
or refer to the same communication object from multiple<B> :acviewport.
</B>tags.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An acviewport communication object is called each time a window is opened.
 A global communication object is called only once.
