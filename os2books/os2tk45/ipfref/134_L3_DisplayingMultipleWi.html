<H1>Displaying Multiple Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 135 -->
<P>
To display more than one window on the screen, you must assign a unique
group number to each window with the<B> group=</B> attribute. This attribute
can be specified with<B> :link.</B> or the heading tag.
<P>
If you do not specify a group number, a value of 0 is assigned. (This is
the default value and is reserved for use by IPF.) If another window is
already opened with the number specified for<B> group=</B>, IPF swaps its
image (places the image in the same window) for the one defined by the heading
or link tag.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a group number is assigned in both a heading and a hypertext
or an automatic link, the link group number overrides the heading group
number. The numbers you can assign to<B> group=</B> are integers from 1
to 64 000.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Compare the three heading definitions in the following figure. Notice that:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The first and second windows have different group
numbers and different positions.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The second and third windows have the same group number.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The second and third windows have the same size and
position.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Now assume that the source file shown in the previous figure is compiled,
and the user selects "My First Window" from the Contents window. The window
in the following figure displays.
<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="134_L3_DisplayingMultipleWi_26.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=417>
<P>
Multiple windows display with different group numbers.
<P>
If the user selects the hypertext link in this window, "My Second Window"
will appear, as shown in the following figure.
<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="134_L3_DisplayingMultipleWi_27.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=417>
<P>
Multiple windows display with same group numbers.
<P>

<P>
The windows appear next to each other because their heading definitions
specify different group numbers.  If the user now selects the hypertext
link in "My Second Window," the resulting screen will be as shown in the
following figure.
<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="134_L3_DisplayingMultipleWi_28.gif" WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=416>
<P>
Compiled Output of Third Window from Group Number. "My Third Window" replaced
"My Second Window" because it has the same group number as "My Second Window."
