<P>
A group of windows can be given the semblance of one window and yet offer
the advantage of different windows; for example, text can be displayed next
to an object the text describes. The author creates this effect by defining
a window that consists of:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><LI>h1.</B> or<B> :h2.</B> primary-window heading
tags, followed by automatic links to secondary windows.  (Text is not allowed.)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><LI>h2.</B> secondary-window heading tags, each
followed by text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The primary window and its secondary windows must reside in the same file.

<P>
The position and size of the primary window determines the boundaries for
its secondary windows. If the position and size of a secondary window are
defined in absolute values that exceed the perimeter of the primary window,
the secondary window is clipped.  (When a window is clipped, part of it
lies outside the window boundary and cannot be viewed.)
<P>
Sizes of secondary windows can be defined as percentages of the primary-window
size. The minimum size of a secondary window (expressed in percentages)
is zero height by zero width.  Negative values for origin and position are
not allowed.
