<H1>Setting Up the IPF Help Tables</H1><!-- entering slot 238 -->
<P>
Two table structures in application memory or in resource files (.RC file-name
extension), identify window resources in the IPF library.  The help table
associates each application window with its corresponding help subtable
and the window identifier of its extended help window.  The help subtable
associates each entry field, menu item and push button within an application
window with the window identifier (ID) of its help window.  The address
of the help table is passed to the application during initialization of
the IPF initializing structure (HELPINIT).
<P>
When the user requests help on a field, menu bar, or push button in the
application window, IPF uses the help subtable associated with the field
to find the window ID of the contextual help window for the field.  The
help subtable also can store optional entries relating to application-specific
information.
<P>
The maximum size of the help table is 64KB. The number of help subtables
is limited to 16 000.
<P>
IPF supports two methods of defining help tables and help subtables. They
can be allocated in memory, or they can be defined as resources. In either
case, the information passed to IPF is identical.
