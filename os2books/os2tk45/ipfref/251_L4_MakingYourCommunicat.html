<P>
As a programmer creating communication objects, you need to be certain that
your communication object can successfully complete the following communication
chain tasks:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object must add itself to
the communication chain.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a communication object that was added to the
chain before your communication object was added removes itself from the
chain, your communication object must respond to keep the chain intact.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your communication object must be able to remove
itself from the chain and keep the chain intact.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
