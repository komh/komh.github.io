Push buttons provide users with a fast and easy way to access commonly used
IPF tasks.  When a user selects a push button, the action represented by
the text on the push button is carried out immediately. Push buttons are
displayed in a window called a<I> control area</I>.  A control area can
be defined within the IPF coverpage window, or the IPF text window (the
child of the coverpage window), or both.  For information about the IPF
coverpage, see the following figure.

IPF provides one set of push buttons for online documents and another set
for help windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The IPF Default Window for Push Buttons. These push buttons appear in the
control area of the coverpage window.
<P>
Notice the difference in the following figure. This example shows a help
window with a set of push buttons in the control area of the IPF text window.

<P>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="067_L2_PushButtons_16.gif" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=248>
<P>
A Help Window. These push buttons were defined in the control area of the
IPF page window.
<P>
If the user changes the size of the window, the push buttons in the control
area will wrap around onto the next line. The push buttons cannot be clipped
or scrolled horizontally, because the control area is not part of the scrollable
area of the IPF text window.
