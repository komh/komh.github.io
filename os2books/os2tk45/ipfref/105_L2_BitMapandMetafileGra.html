<H1>Bit Map and Metafile Graphics</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
In a previous topic, we discussed how you can use<B> :cgraphic.</B> to illustrate
your text with character graphics.  With<B> :artwork.</B>, you can illustrate
your text with<I> bit-map</I> or<I> metafile</I> graphics.  A bit map is
a representation of an image, and can be created with such tools as the
Icon Editor, which is available with the<I> IBM Developer</I>. Metafiles
provide device independence; bit maps do not. The bit map or metafile graphics
reside in a file that must be specified with the<B> name=' '</B> attribute
of<B> :artwork.</B>. This file is then loaded when you compile your source
file with the IPF compiler. The OS/2 2.0 compress bit map format is not
supported by the IPF compiler.  The IPF compiler compresses the bit maps.

<P>
The artwork tag has other attributes as well:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> align=</B> attribute enables you to position
the graphic. The values are<B> left</B>,<B> right</B>, and<B> center</B>,
and are with respect to the current margins.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> fit</B> attribute causes a bit map to be redrawn
and scaled to fit the window.
<P>
The ratio between the width and height of the window should be the ratio
of the original width and height of the bit map or metafile; otherwise,
the graphic might appear distorted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> runin</B> attribute enables you to place a
graphic within a line of text. For example, to include an icon within a
line of text, the text and tag would be as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>

It would bring the artwork into the screen like this.
