<P>
Dynamic data formatting (DDF) allows you to incorporate text, bit maps,
or metafiles in an IPF window at execution time. You can use the dynamic
data formatting facility in conjunction with the dynamic data format tag
(<B>:ddf.</B>). The<B> :ddf.</B> tag functions as a request by IPF to the
application for the DDF data, and a set of DDF application programming interface
calls that provide primitives for formatting text. The DDF calls also allow
you to incorporate bit maps and metafiles dynamically, and to specify a
hypertext or inform link from DDF data to non-DDF data.
<P>
IPF has no knowledge of the DDF data it displays, other than that a block
of data has been provided to it by the application program. Therefore, DDF
data cannot be searched or printed. In effect, DDF is a specific extension
of application-controlled windows. When the<B> :ddf.</B> tag is encountered
at execution time, IPF sends the HM_QUERY_DDF_DATA message to the application
window procedure with which the current instance of help is associated.
 IPF sends the message either by a WinAssociateHelpInstance request or a
HM_SET_OBJCOM_WINDOW message.
