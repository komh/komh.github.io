<P>
Normally, lines of text that have no formatting tags are wrapped by IPF;
that is, irregular lines in the source file become a continuous string,
and one word follows another on a line until the line width of the current
window is filled, a formatting tag is encountered, or the end of the window
is reached.
<P>
The<B> :lines.</B> tag and its corresponding end tag,<B> :elines.</B>, enable
you to control where lines break.
<P>
The following example shows how the<B> :lines.</B> tag prevents wrapping
of text.
<P>
<B>Input Example</B>
<P>
Here is how IPF normally wraps lines to fit the window width&amp;colon.

<P>
:p.&amp;odq.Normally, lines of text that have no formatting tags are wrapped
by IPF; that is, irregular lines in the source file become a continuous
string, and one word follows another on a line until the line width of the
current window is filled, a formatting tag is encountered, or the end of
the window is reached.&amp;cdq.
<P>
In the following example, IPF will not wrap the lines, because we used the
:hp2.&amp;colon.lines&amp;per.:ehp2. tag to prevent the lines from being
formatted.
<PRE><B>:lines.</B>
&amp;odq.Normally, lines of text that have no
formatting tags are wrapped by IPF;
that is, irregular lines in the source
file become a continuous string, and
one word follows another on a line
until the line width of the current
window is filled, a formatting tag
is encountered, or the end of the
window is reached.&amp;cdq.
<B>:elines.</B>

<P>
The quotation appears in two forms.
<P>
<B>Plain Lines Example</B>
<P>
Here is how IPF normally wraps lines to fit the window width:
<P>
"Normally, lines of text that have no formatting tags are wrapped by IPF;
that is, irregular lines in the source file become a continuous string,
and one word follows another on a line until the line width of the current
window is filled, a formatting tag is encountered, or the end of the window
is reached."
<P>
In the following example, IPF will not wrap the lines, because we used the
<B>:lines.</B> tag to prevent the lines from being formatted. "Normally,
lines of text that have no
<BR>
formatting tags are wrapped by IPF;
<BR>
that is, irregular lines in the source
<BR>
file become a continuous string, and
<BR>
one word follows another on a line
<BR>
until the line width of the current
<BR>
window is filled, a formatting tag
<BR>
is encountered, or the end of the
<BR>
window is reached."
<BR>

<P>
In the first case, IPF wraps the lines to fit the window width. In the second,
IPF does not wrap the lines, because<B> :lines.</B> prevents them from being
formatted. If a line of text were to exceed the width of the current window,
it would be clipped.  Also, when IPF encounters other tags between<B> :lines.
</B>and<B> :elines.</B>, such as quotation tags, the tags are processed.

<P>
<B>Aligned Lines:</B> <B> :lines.</B> has an<B> align=</B> attribute, which
you use to align text to the left, right, or center of the window.
<P>
Assume that in the previous example, the tag was:
<PRE><B>:lines align=center.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
The output would be as shown here.
<P>
Normally, lines of text that have no formatting tags
<BR>
are "wrapped" by IPF; that is, irregular lines in the
<BR>
source file become a continuous string, and one word
<BR>
follows another on a line until the line width of the
<BR>
current window is filled, a formatting tag is
<BR>
encountered, or the end of the window is reached.
<BR>

<P>
Text aligned in the center of the window.
