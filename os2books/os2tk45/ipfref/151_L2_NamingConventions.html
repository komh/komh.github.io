<P>
It is a good idea to give your source files an extension of IPF, so they
can be distinguished from your other files. For example:
<PRE>  MYHELP.IPF
</PRE>

<P>
The IPF compiler does not require an IPF file-name extension; however, if
your file has an IPF file-name extension, you will not have to type the
extension at compile time.
