<P>
The link tag (<B>:link.</B>) allows you to link to a heading, a footnote,
an external database, or another application. The<B> reftype=</B>  attribute
is required with each link tag description.  This attribute identifies the
type of link you are defining.
<P>
The<B> res=</B> attribute and the value specified identify the window you
are linking to.  This attribute is the window identifier. A<B> res=</B> number
must be in the range 1 through 64 000. The same window identifier must be
specified in the tagging of the window you are linking to in order for a
hypertext link to exist (see <A HREF="109_L3_HypertextLinks.html">Hypertext
Links</A>).
<P>
The IPF compiler recognizes links to headings (including hidden headings)
only when the heading level is within the default range (<B>toc=</B>123)
or specified range of heading levels.  If you specify a window identifier
for a level that is lower in the hierarchy than that recognized for contents
entries, and then attempt to link to it, the compiler returns an error message.
 For example, suppose the default is in effect for contents entries; that
is, only heading levels 1 through 3 cause entries in the Contents window.
 Also suppose your file contains the following heading definition:
<PRE><B>:h4 res=</B>050.Copy File
</PRE>

<P>
The heading "Copy File"  appears in the same window as the preceding heading
level 3.  If you use this window identifier in a link definition to link
to the heading from another window, the IPF compiler returns the error message,
No res for this reference.
<P>
If you are creating windows for an online document (a .INF file), you can
use the<B> res=</B>,<B> id=</B>, or<B> name=</B> attribute of the heading
tag to specify window identifiers. An advantage of using either<B> id=</B> or
<B>name=</B> is that you can specify both alphabetic and numeric characters,
which can make the job of assigning and remembering window IDs easier.  If
you use one of these attributes, you must use the<B> refid=</B> attribute
of<B> :link.</B> when defining a hypertext cross-reference to the window.

<P>
If you need to use both<B> res=</B> numbers and<B> id=</B> values, you can
specify both in a window heading. For simplicity, you can assign the same
number to both identifiers.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If an OS/2 application needs to communicate with an IPF window,
you must use the<B> res=</B> attribute as a window identifier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
