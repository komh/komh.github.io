<H1>Customizing Master Help Index and Glossary Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 77 -->
<P>
OS/2 online information is accessible through the "Master Help Index" and
"Glossary" Workplace Shell objects. Users can access alphabetized lists
of index entries simply by double clicking on the icons for these objects.

<P>
As an author who wants to create or modify Help Indexes and Glossaries,
you need to understand that the Master Help Index object and Glossary object
that are installed by default with the OS/2 operating system are the same
class of object. In other words, they are the exact same<I> kind</I> of
object. Like the rest of the Workplace Shell user objects, they can be created,
shadowed, copied, and so on. This also means that they can be modified through
the "Settings Notebook". To look at the Settings Notebook for the Master
Help Index, simply do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select the Master Help Index user object by single-clicking
on its icon with mouse button 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Press mouse button 2 for the object's pop-up
menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select "Open" with mouse button 1, then select
"Settings" from the pop-up menu that appears.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The "Properties" page of the Master Help Index object's Settings Notebook
can be modified. On this page, the "Files/Environment name(s):" setting
can be modified. This setting specifies where online helps (.HLP files)
containing Master Help Index entries are located. The Master Help Index
object's default setting is defined in the file<B> CONFIG.SYS</B> by the
"HELP" environment variable.
<P>
The<B> global</B> attribute of the<B> :i1.</B> and<B> :i2.</B> tags identifies
index entries as candidates for the Master Help Index or Glossary. Good
candidates are pointers to procedural and conceptual topics.  For example,
a simple Master Help Index entry for conceptual information about batch
files might look like this:
<PRE><B>:i1 global.</B>batch files, creating</PRE>
When referring to an<B> :i1.</B> tag, use the<B> global</B> attribute in
both the<B> :i1.</B> and<B> :i2.</B> tags.  For example:
<PRE><B>:i1 id=</B>copy <B>global</B>.copying
<B>:i2 refid=</B>copy <B>global</B>.help topics
<B>:i2 refid=</B>copy <B>global</B>.document topics
</PRE>

<P>
As an author, you can create product-specific indexes and glossaries, add
entries to the Master Help Index or Glossary (or customized, renamed copies
of either user object), change their Notebook "Files/Environment name(s):"
Settings to match online helps with<B> global</B> index entries, and so
on. However, it requires programming skills to enable applications to do
these tasks at installation or run time (see <A HREF="263_L1_CreatingMasterIndexe.html">Creating
Master Indexes and Glossaries with Applications</A>).
