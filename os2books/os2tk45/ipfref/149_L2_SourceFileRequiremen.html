<H1>Source File Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 151 -->
<P>
Using a single source file, you can produce a successful display of information
with a limited number of tags.  These tags are:
<PRE><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
: userdoc .
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
: docprof .
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
: title .
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
: h1 .
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
: p .
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
: euserdoc .
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL></PRE>

<P>
The<B> :userdoc.</B> tag is always the first item in your source file.  It
identifies the beginning of an IPF file. This tag is a signal to the IPF
compiler to begin translating the tag language.
<P>
The<B> :euserdoc.</B> tag is required as the last line of the file to signal
the end of the tagged document.
<P>
Place the<B> :docprof.</B> tag at the beginning of your source file after
the<B> :userdoc.</B> tag and before any heading definitions.  Use the function
of the<B> toc</B> (table of contents) attribute of the<B> :docprof.</B> tag
to control the heading levels displayed in the Content window.  For example,
if you want only heading levels 1 and 2 to appear, the tagging is:
<PRE><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<B>: docprof   toc =</B> 12 .<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL></PRE>

<P>
If no<B> toc=</B> value is specified, heading level 1 through 3 appear in
the Contents window.
<P>
Not to be confused with window titles, the text string specified with a
<B>:title.</B> tag is placed into the title bar of an online document. When
the online document is displayed, the title appears on the title line of
the main window.  The tagging looks like this:
<PRE><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<B>: title .</B> Endangered   Mammals<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL></PRE>

<P>
The maximum length of a title string specified with a<B> :title.</B> tag
is 47 characters, including spaces and blanks.
<P>
The title tag provides a name for the online document but is also used for
titles of Help windows.  The title appears in the title bar of the main
window.  You usually place the title tag after the<B> :docprof.</B> tag.

<P>
Every file must start with a<B> :h1.</B> tag.  Heading level sequences must
not skip a level in the heading hierarchy.  For example, you cannot have
a heading level 1 tag (<B>:h1.</B>) followed by a heading level 3 tag (<B>:h3.</B>).

<P>
You must have at least one paragraph tag (<B>:p.</B>) and associated text
to display a window.
<P>
The following figure shows an IPF source file.
<P>
The source file contains a<B> :userdoc.</B> tag, a<B> :title.</B> tag, a
heading tag with a window identifier, a<B> :p.</B> tag, and the<B> :euserdoc.
</B>tag.
<PRE>.*<B>:userdoc.</B>
<B>:title.</B>Endangered Mammals
<B>:h1 res=</B>001.The Manatee
.*
<B>:p.</B>
The Manatee has a broad flat tail and two flipper
like forelegs.  There are no back legs.
The Manatee's large upper lip is split in two and
can be used like fingers to place food into the
mouth.  Bristly hair protrudes from its lips,
and almost buried in its hide are small eyes, with
which it can barely see.
