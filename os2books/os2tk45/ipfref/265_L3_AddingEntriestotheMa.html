<H1>Adding Entries to the Master Help Index at Installation</H1><!-- entering slot 282 -->
<P>
Mindex class objects such as the Master Help Index and Glossary user objects
display index entries that have been tagged with the<B> global</B> attribute
(see <A HREF="195_L2_i1andi2Index.html">:i1. and :i2.  (Index)</A>). These
index entries can be placed in any .HLP file. The .HLP files available to
a given Mindex class user object are identified in the object's Settings
Notebook.
<P>
For example, the Master Help Index user object that is installed with the
OS/2 operating system has a default "Files/Environment name(s)" setting
of "HELP". This refers to the HELP environment variable identified in the
CONFIG.SYS file. Therefore, if you wanted the<B> global</B> index entries
in your .HLP files to appear in the Master Help Index user object, you could
simply copy your .HLP files to directories or files specified by the HELP
environment variable.
<P>
The default value of HELP is:
<PRE>HELP=C:\OS2\HELP;C:\OS2\HELP\TUTORIAL;
</PRE>
Alternatively, you could modify the value of the "HELP" environment variable
by updating CONFIG.SYS.
