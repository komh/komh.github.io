A window is an area of the screen with visible boundaries within which information
is displayed.  Often a single window uses the entire screen for its information.
Because online information is best presented in small pieces, or units,
most designs call for a multiple window format. This chapter explains how
to size and position more than one window on a screen, and how to use attributes
that enable IPF to open and close those windows. Before you begin this chapter,
make sure you read about the OS/2 standard windows described in <A HREF="012_L1_IPFUserInterface.html">IPF
User Interface</A>.
