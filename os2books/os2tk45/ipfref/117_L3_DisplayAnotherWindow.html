<H1>Display Another Window of the Same Library</H1><!-- entering slot 118 -->
<P>
When you want the user to link to another window in the current library,
use the<B> reftype=hd</B> attribute with<B> :link.</B>. For example:
<PRE><B>:link</B>
<B>reftype=hd res=</B>21084.What Are Libraries For?
<B>:elink.</B>
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> hd</B> attribute tells the compiler to link to a heading in another
window. The<B> res=</B> attribute value specifies the identification of
the window being linked to.
<P>
The text "What Are Libraries For?" is uniquely highlighted in the window
so that the user knows it is selectable. If the user selects it, the window
containing the heading defined by<B> res=</B> 21084 appears.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The highlighting of a hypertext phrase is done with a color
selected by IPF and should not be confused with highlighted-phrase tags,
which are used to change the type font. (See <A HREF="085_L2_HighlightedPhrases.html">Highlighted
Phrases</A> for an explanation of these tags.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The tagging shown in the following figure contains an example of the link
tag.  Also included is the tagging for the window being linked to.
<PRE>:************************************************
:* In the following source, the text of the window
:* contains a heading tag with a window
:* identifier, a paragraph tag, and a hypertext
:* link to another window.

:h1 res=21083.The Library Manager
:i1.object code libraries
:p.
The Library Manager (LIB) lets you create and maintain
libraries of object code.  A library is an organized
collection
of object code; that is, a library contains functions and data
that are already assembled or compiled and ready for linking
with your programs. See:
<B>:link</B>
<B>reftype=hd res=</B>21084.What Are Libraries For?
<B>:elink.</B>
:p.
LIB works with both DOS and OS/2 files.
:************************************************
:* The following contains a heading tag with a
:* window identifier that matches the link-tag
:* res= attribute above.
:* This file also contains an unordered list.

<B>:p.</B>Programming libraries of object code are used:
<B>:ul.</B>
<B>:li.</B>To support high-level languages.
:p.Most compilers include libraries to perform standard
operations, such as input/output and floating-point mathematics.
:p.
When your program refers to a library routine, the
compiler and linker combine the library routine with your
program.
<B>:li.</B>To perform complex and specialized activities, such
as database management or advanced graphics.
:p.Compilers include libraries for specialized tasks. You
also can use a library from a third party software vendor.
<B>:li.</B>To support your own work.
:p.If you have created routines that you use with a
variety of programs, you might want to consolidate these routines
into a library.  You then can link to one library object module
rather than to a large group of object files.
