<P>
DosQueryFSAttach returns information about all block devices, and all character
and pseudocharacter devices. The subject of the information returned by
this call changes frequently. Therefore, the information that this function
returns may no longer be valid when you receive it.
<P>
The information returned for disks attached to the resident file system
of the kernel can be used to determine:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the kernel recognized the disk as one attached
to its file system, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the kernel attached its file system to the disk
because no other file-system drivers were attached to the disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This information can be important for a program that needs to know what
file system is attached to the drive. A situation could arise where the
file-system driver that recognizes a certain disk has not been loaded into
the system. There is then a potential for the data on the disk to be destroyed
because the wrong file system gets attached to the disk by default.
