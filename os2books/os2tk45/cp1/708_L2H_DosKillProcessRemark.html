<P>
DosKillProcess allows a process to send the KILLPROCESS exception to another
process or group of processes. The default action of the system is to end
each of the processes. A process may intercept this action by installing
an exception handler for the KILLPROCESS exception (see <A HREF="1571_L2_DosSetExceptionHandl.html">DosSetExceptionHandler</A>).
In such a case, the program will ensure the integrity of its files, and
then issue <A HREF="460_L2_DosExit.html">DosExit</A>.
<P>
If there is no exception handler, or if no handler handles the exception,
then DosKillProcess affects the process as if one of its threads has issued
DosKillProcess for the entire process. All file buffers are written, and
the handles opened by the process are closed. Any internal buffers managed
by the program externally of the system are not written. An example of such
a buffer is a C-language library internal character buffer.
<P>
The parent of the process gets the "Unintercepted DosKillProcess" termination
code when it issues <A HREF="1940_L2_DosWaitChild.html">DosWaitChild</A>.

<P>
The "ERROR_ZOMBIE_PROCESS" error code indicates that the specified process
has ended, but its parent has not yet issued <A HREF="1940_L2_DosWaitChild.html">DosWaitChild
</A>to get its return code.
