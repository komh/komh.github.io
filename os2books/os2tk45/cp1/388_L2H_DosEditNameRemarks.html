<H1>DosEditName - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 392 -->
<P>
DosEditName is used to search for and edit names of files and subdirectories.
Typically, it is used in conjunction with such functions as <A HREF="744_L2_DosMove.html">DosMove
</A>and <A HREF="194_L2_DosCopy.html">DosCopy</A>, which do not permit the
use of global file-name characters, to perform repetitive operations on
files.
<P>
An example of an editing operation is:<I> pszSource</I> = "foo.bar";<I> pszEdit</I> =
"*.baz"; result = "FOO.BAZ." In the editing process, the string is changed
to uppercase.
<P>
Global file-name characters have two uses: searching and editing. If they
are specified in<I> pszSource</I>, they are interpreted as search characters;
in<I> pszEdit</I>, they are interpreted as editing characters. This difference
can be illustrated with an example using the COPY utility. The user types
the following:
<PRE>
copy *.old *.new

</PRE>
In the source, "*" acts as a search character and determines which files
to return to the user. In the target, "*" functions as an editing character
by constructing new names for the matched files.
<P>
When used as search characters in<I> pszSource</I>, global file-name characters
simply match files and behave like any other search characters. They have
the following meanings:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The period (.) has no special meaning itself, but
"?" gives it one.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The asterisk will form a match with any character,
including a blank, or with the absence of a character. The matching operation
does not cross the null character or the backslash (\), which means that
only the file name is matched, not an entire path.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The question mark matches 1 character, unless what
it would match is a "." or the terminating null characters, in which case
it matches 0 characters. It also does not cross "\".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
Any character other than * and ? matches itself, including ".".
<P>
Searching is not case-sensitive.
<P>
If a file name does not have a period (.), an implicit one is automatically
appended to the end during searching operations. For example, searching
for "foo." would return "foo".
<P>
When used in<I> pszEdit</I>, global file-name characters have the following
meanings:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The period (.) in the target synchronizes pointers.
It causes the source pointer to match a corresponding pointer to the period
in the target. Counting starts from the left of the pointers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The question mark copies one character, unless what
it would copy is a period (.), in which case it copies no characters. It
also copies no characters when the end of the source string is reached.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The asterisk copies characters from the source to
the target until it finds a source character that matches the character
following it in the target.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
Editing is case-insensitive and case-preserving. If conflicts arise between
the case of the source and that of the editing string, the case of the editing
string is used, for example:
<PRE>
source string:      "file.txt"
editing string:     "*E.TMP"
destination string: "filE.TMP"

copy file.txt  *E.tmp  -&gt;  filE.tmp

</PRE>
