<P>
DosDebug maintains a list of system semaphores which it checks before sending
any debug notifications to the debugger. DosDebug allows one process (the
debugger) to control the execution of another process that is being debugged
(the debuggee).
<P>
A process must be selected for debugging when it is started. See <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>or <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession</A> for how
this is done. Once a process has been selected for debugging, you must use
DosDebug to control and examine its execution.
<P>
If no error is returned, a notification resides in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C4 30 --> DosDebug
Buffer</A> structure. The<I> Cmd</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C4 30 --> DosDebug
Buffer</A> structure determines which notification is set. The data returned
with the notification varies, depending on the command passed in the<I> Cmd
</I>field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C4 30 --> DosDebug Buffer</A> structure.

<P>
If the return code is set to ERROR_INTERRUPT, a debug notification might
have been lost, depending on the command that was interrupted.
<P>
DosDebug can also return with a return value set by another function.
<P>
DosDebug allows you to view and modify EXE and DLL code and data objects
(those objects defined in the EXE header and loaded by the OS/2 program
loader).
<P>
In addition to the EXE and DLL code and data objects, DosDebug allows you
to view objects allocated dynamically using <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A>.
Code or data objects created by other methods may not be accessible.
<P>
