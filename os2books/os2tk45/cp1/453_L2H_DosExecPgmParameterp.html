of the name of the file that contains the program to be executed.
<P>
When the environment is passed to the target program, this name is copied
into "po" in the environment description shown above.
<P>
If the string appears to be a fully qualified file specification (that is,
it contains a ":" or a "\" in the second position), then the file name must
include the extension, and the program is loaded from the indicated drive:directory.

<P>
If the string is not a fully qualified path, the current directory is searched.
If the file name is not found in the current directory, each drive:directory
specification in the PATH defined in the current-process environment is
searched for this file. Note that any extension (.XXX) is acceptable for
the executable file being loaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
