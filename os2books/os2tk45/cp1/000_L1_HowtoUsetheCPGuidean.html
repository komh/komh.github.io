<H1>How to Use the CP Guide and Reference</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
The OS/2 operating system Control Program Guide and Reference is a detailed
technical guide and reference for application programmers. It gives reference
information and code examples to enable you to write source code using Control
Program functions.
<P>
Before you begin to use this information, it would be helpful to understand
how you can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Expand the Contents to see all available topics<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Obtain additional information for a highlighted word
or phrase<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use action bar choices<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the programming information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>How to Use the Contents</B>
<P>
When the Contents window first appears, some topics have a plus (+) sign
beside them. The plus sign indicates that additional topics are available.

<P>
To expand the Contents if you are using a mouse, click on the plus sign.
If you are using the keyboard, use the Up or Down Arrow key to highlight
the topic, and press the plus (+) key. For example,<B> File System</B> has
a plus sign beside it. To see additional topics for that heading, click
on the plus sign or highlight that topic and press the plus (+) key.
<P>
To view a topic, double-click on the topic (or press the Up or Down Arrow
key to highlight the topic, and then press the Enter key).
<P>
<B>How to Obtain Additional Information</B>
<P>
After you select a topic, the information for that topic appears in a window.
Highlighted words or phrases indicate that additional information is available.
You will notice that certain words and phrases are highlighted in green
letters, or in white letters on a black background. These are called hypertext
terms. If you are using a mouse, double-click on the highlighted word. If
you are using a keyboard, press the Tab key to move to the highlighted word,
and then press the Enter key. Additional information then appears in a window.

<P>
<B>How to Use Action Bar Choices</B>
<P>
Several choices are available for managing information presented in the
OS/2 operating system Control Program Guide and Reference. There are three
pull-down menus on the action bar:  the<B> Services</B> menu, the<B> Options
</B>menu, and the<B> Help</B> menu.
<P>
The actions that are selectable from the<B> Services</B> menu operate on
the active window currently displayed on the screen. These actions include
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>Bookmark</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Allows you to set a placeholder
so you can retrieve information of interest to you.
<P>
When you place a bookmark on a topic, it is added to a list of bookmarks
you have previously set. You can view the list, and you can remove one or
all bookmarks from the list. If you have not set any bookmarks, the list
is empty.
<P>
To set a bookmark, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Select a topic from the Contents.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->When that topic appears, choose the<B> Bookmark
</B>option from the<B> Services</B> pull-down.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->If you want to change the name used for the bookmark,
type the new name in the field.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on the<B> Place</B> radio button (or press
the Up or Down Arrow key to select it).<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on<B> OK</B> (or select it and press Enter).
The bookmark is then added to the bookmark list.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Search
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Allows you to find occurrences of a word or
phrase in the current topic, selected topics, or all topics.
<P>
You can specify a word or phrase to be searched. You can also limit the
search to a set of topics by first marking the topics in the Contents list.

<P>
To search for a word or phrase in all topics, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Choose the<B> Search</B> option from the<B> Services
</B>pull-down.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Type the word or words to be searched for.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on<B> All sections</B> (or press the Up
or Down Arrow keys to select it).<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on<B> Search</B> (or select it and press
Enter) to begin the search.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->The list of topics where the word or phrase appears
is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Print</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Allows
you to print one or more topics. You can also print a set of topics by first
marking the topics in the Contents list.
<P>
To print the document Contents list, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Choose<B> Print</B> from the<B> Services</B> pull-down.
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on<B> Contents</B> (or press the Up or
Down Arrow key to select it).<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Click on<B> Print</B> (or select it and press
Enter).<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->The Contents list is printed on your printer.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Copy</B><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Allows
you to copy a topic that you are viewing to the System Clipboard or to a
file that you can edit. You will find this particularly useful for copying
syntax definitions and program samples into the application that you are
developing.
<P>
You can copy a topic that you are viewing in two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><B>Copy</B> copies the topic that you are viewing
into the System Clipboard. If you are using a Presentation Manager (PM)
editor (for example, the System Editor) that copies or cuts (or<!-- entering slot 1 --> both)
to the System Clipboard, and pastes to the System Clipboard, you can easily
add the copied information to your program source module.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><B>Copy to file</B> copies the topic that you are
viewing into a temporary file named TEXT.TMP. You can later edit that file
by using any editor. You will find TEXT.TMP in the directory where your
viewable document resides.
<P>
To copy a topic, do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Expand the Contents list and select a topic.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->When the topic appears, choose<B> Copy to file
</B>from the<B> Services</B> pull-down.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->The system puts the text pertaining to that
topic into the temporary file named TEXT.TMP.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> For
information on one of the other choices in the<B> Services</B> pull-down,
highlight the choice and press the F1 key.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The actions that are selectable from the<B> Options</B> menu allow you to
change the way your Contents list is displayed. To expand the Contents and
show all levels for all topics, choose<B> Expand all</B> from the<B> Options
</B>pull-down. You can also press the Ctrl and * keys together. For information
on one of the other choices in the<B> Options</B> pull-down, highlight the
choice and press the F1 key.
<P>
The actions that are selectable from the<B> Help</B> menu allow you to select
different types of help information. You can also press the F1 key for help
information about the Information Presentation Facility (IPF).
<P>
<B>How to Use the Programming Information</B>
<P>
The Control Program Guide and Reference consists of guide and reference
information that provides a detailed description of each system function.

<P>
Control Program programming information is presented by component, such
as Error Management, Exception Management, and File System, for example:

<PRE>     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐     │            Contents                     │
     ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
     │                                         │
     │  + Error Management                     │
     │  + Exception Management                 │
     │  + File System                          │
     │                                         │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
By clicking on the plus sign beside "File System", you see an alphabetic
list of the Control Program functions for the file system. Selecting a function
takes you directly into the reference information for that function.
<P>
Units of reference information are presented in selectable multiple windows
or viewports. A viewport is a Presentation Manager window that can be sized,
moved, minimized, maximized, or closed. By selecting a unit (in this case,
an entry on the Contents list), you will see two windows displayed:
<PRE>   ┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
   │ Unit Title         │      Selection Title     │
   ├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
   │ Select an item     │                          │
   │                    │                          │
   │ Function Syntax    │                          │
   │ Parameters         │                          │
   │ Return Values      │                          │
   │ Notes              │                          │
   │ Example            │                          │
   │ Related Functions  │                          │
   │ Glossary           │                          │
   │                    │                          │
   └────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
The window on the left is the primary window. It contains a list of items
that are always available to you. The window on the right is the secondary
window. It contains a 'snapshot' of the unit information. For reference
units (that is, function descriptions), this window contains the Function
Syntax.
<P>
All of the information needed to understand a reference unit (or topic)
is readily available to you through the primary window. The information
is divided into discrete information groups, and only the appropriate information
group appears for the topic that you are viewing.
<P>
The information groups for a reference unit (that is, a function description)
can include the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Function Syntax<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Parameters<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Return Values<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Notes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Example<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Related Functions<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Glossary<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This list may vary. Some topics may be omitted when they do not<!-- entering slot 2 --> apply.

<P>
Information groups are displayed in separate viewports that are stacked
in a third window location that overlaps the secondary window. By selecting
an item (information group) in the primary window, the item is displayed
in the third window location, as follows:
<PRE> ┌────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────┐ │ Unit Title     │   Selection │   Glossary       │
 ├────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────────┤
 │ Select an item │             │ Select a starting│
 │                │             │ letter of        │

 └────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
By selecting successive items from the primary window, additional windows
are displayed on top of the previous windows displayed in the third window
location. For example, in a function description, Parameters and Return
Values are items listed in the primary window. When selected, they appear
one on top of the other in the third window location. Because of this, you
may move the first selected (topmost) window to the left before selecting
the next item. This allows simultaneous display of two related pieces of
information from the "stack" of windows in the third window location, as
follows:
<PRE> ┌────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┐
 │ Unit Title     │  Parameters  │  Return Values  │
 ├────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┤
 │ Select an item │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │ Parameters     │              │                 │
 │ Return Values  │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │    .           │              │                 │
 │                │              │                 │
 └────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
Each window can be individually closed from its system menu. All windows
are closed when you close the primary window.
<P>
Some secondary windows may have the appearance of a split screen. For example,
an illustration may appear in the left half of the window, and scrollable,
explanatory information may appear in the right half of the window. Because
illustrations may not necessarily fit into the small window size on your
screen, you may maximize the secondary window for better readability.
