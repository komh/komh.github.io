<P>
DosSleep suspends the current thread for a specified time interval.
<P>
If a time interval of 0 is specified, the thread gives up the remainder
of the current time slice, allowing any other ready threads of equal or
higher priority to execute; the calling thread will execute again during
its next scheduled time slice. If there is no other ready thread of equal
or higher priority, DosSleep returns immediately; it does not give control
to a thread of lower priority.
<P>
A time interval of 1 effectively causes the thread to give up the reminder
of its current time slice and allow the next ready thread to execute, regardless
of its priority.  This technique gives lower priority threads a chance to
execute, at least for the remainder of the time slice.
<P>
Time intervals for DosSleep, <A HREF="087_L2_DosAsyncTimer.html">DosAsyncTimer</A>,
and <A HREF="1801_L2_DosStartTimer.html">DosStartTimer</A> are specified
in milliseconds; however, it is important to recognize that the actual duration
of the specified time interval will be affected by two factors:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the system clock keeps track of time in less
precise units known as<I> clock ticks</I>. The duration of a clock tick
depends on the frequency of the system-clock interrupt that is used by your
computer. (To determine the duration of the clock tick on your computer,
issue <A HREF="1372_L2_DosQuerySysInfo.html">DosQuerySysInfo</A> and examine
the timer-interval field.)
<P>
Because clock ticks are less precise than millisecond values, any time interval
that is specified in milliseconds will be rounded up to the next clock tick.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, because the system is a priority-based, multitasking
operating system, there is no guarantee that a thread will resume immediately
after the timer interval expires. If a higher-priority process or thread
is executing, the timed thread blocks. (To minimize the inaccuracy caused
by preemptive scheduling, an application can dedicate a thread to managing
time-critical tasks and then raise that thread to a higher priority.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the time interval for DosSleep refers to execution time (accumulated
scheduled time slices), not to elapsed real time.  Elapsed real time will
be longer and will vary, depending on the hardware and on the number and
priorities of other threads executing in the system. (Elapsed real time
for the asynchronous timers, started by <A HREF="087_L2_DosAsyncTimer.html">DosAsyncTimer
</A>and <A HREF="1801_L2_DosStartTimer.html">DosStartTimer</A>, will be
much closer to their specified time intervals because these timers run independently
of the calling thread's execution.)
<P>
Because the above factors usually cause the sleep interval to be longer
than requested (though generally within a few clock ticks), DosSleep should
not be used as a substitute for a real-time clock.
<P>
To ensure optimal performance, do not use DosSleep in a single-thread Presentation
Manager application. (See WinStartTimer.)
<P>
If the calling thread is awakened before the time interval expires (by a
system exception, for example), ERROR_TS_WAKEUP is returned.
