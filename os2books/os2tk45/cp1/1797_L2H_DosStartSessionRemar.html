<H1>DosStartSession - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1815 -->
<P>
DosStartSession allows an application to start another session, and to specify
the name of the program to be started in that session.
<P>
A session can be thought of as a logical console, consisting of buffers
for the screen, keyboard, and mouse.
<P>
New sessions may only be started in the foreground when the caller's session
(or one of the caller's descendant sessions) is currently executing in the
foreground. The foreground session for windowed applications is the session
of the application that owns the window focus. The new session appears in
the Shell switch list.
<P>
Any protect-mode application may start any other protect-mode application
in a new session, regardless of the issuing program's session type.
<P>
You may use <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> to start a process
that is of the same type as the starting process. Process types include
Presentation Manager, text-windowed, and full-screen. You may not use <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>to start a process that is of a different type than the starting process.

<P>
You must use DosStartSession to start a new process from a process that
is of a different type. For example, use DosStartSession to start a Presentation
Manager process from a non-Presentation Manager process.
<P>
If you call DosStartSession from a detached process, the function returns
ERROR_SMG_INVALID_CALL. This happens regardless of whether the session is
to be started in the foreground or in the background. Detached processes
are programs that:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run in the background<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run asynchronously (independently) from their parents
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Do not use the keyboard, mouse, or screen (other than
VioPopups)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Detached processes are started when:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Programs are started from the command line using the
DETACH command<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Programs are started
with <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> using the EXEC_BACKGROUND
flag<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
See <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> for more information
on detached processes.
<P>
<B>Foreground/Background Considerations</B>
<P>
DosStartSession will only start a new session in the foreground if the program
issuing DosStartSession or a descendent session is executing in the foreground
session. Otherwise, DosStartSession will override the foreground request
and start the new session in the background. A unique error is returned,
ERROR_SMG_START_IN_BACKGROUND, indicating that the new session was started
in the background.  An active popup window may also prevent the new session
from starting in the foreground. The foreground session for windowed applications
is the session of the application that owns the window focus. Therefore,
when a windowed session is started in the foreground, the new session will
be given the window focus.
<P>
<B>Parent/Child Relationship</B>
<P>
When you specify SSF_RELATED_CHILD for Related, DosStartSession establishes
a parent session/child session relationship. A parent process/child process
relationship is not established. The parent process is the shell process
just as if the operator had started the program from the shell menu. Therefore,
the<I> ppid</I> returned by DosStartSession may not be used with any system
functions (for example, <A HREF="1713_L2_DosSetPriority.html">DosSetPriority</A>)
that require a parent process/child process relationship.
<P>
Once a process has issued DosStartSession specifying SSF_RELATED_CHILD for
<I>Related</I>, no other process within that session can issue related DosStartSession
functions until all the dependent sessions have ended.
<P>
<B>Debugger Considerations</B>
<P>
Debuggers may want to debug all processes associated with an application,
no matter how the process was started (by <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>or DosStartSession). A special trace option,<I> TraceOpt</I> value 2,
has been provided for this purpose. When a value of 2 is specified for<I> TraceOpt</I>,
the debugger must also supply the name of an existing queue, and a value
of 1 for<I> Related</I>, on the DosStartSession function.
<P>
The Session Manager notifies the debugger whenever a new session is created
through DosStartSession from the initial session started with a value of
2 for<I> TraceOpt</I>, or from any descendant session. The queue is posted
regardless of how the new session is started (related, independent, with
or without inheritance).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the first session started by the parent process (debugger)
ends, any messages generated by descendent sessions of the first session
will not get posted to the parent process (debugger). For example, session
A starts session B. Session B, in turn, starts session C and D. When session
B ends, the messages from sessions C and D will not get posted to session
A.
<P>
Sessions started without inheritance are executed for tracing. It is the
responsibility of the debugger to resume execution of the new process.
<P>
The debugger must issue <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html"><!-- entering slot 1816 -->DosReadQueue
</A>to receive notification when a child session is created. The word containing
the request parameter, returned by <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue</A>,
will have a value of 1. The data element structure has the following format:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Size<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D DC C4 E4 -->USHORT</A><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Session
ID<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D DC C4 E4 -->USHORT</A><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Process
ID<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The debugger should issue <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>with the<I> wait</I> parameter set to 0. This is the only process that
has addressability to the notification data element. After reading and processing
the data element, the debugger must free the segment that contains the data
element by issuing <A HREF="542_L2_DosFreeMem.html">DosFreeMem</A>.
<P>
The debugger may use <A HREF="1526_L2_DosSelectSession.html">DosSelectSession
</A>to switch itself or any descendant session into the foreground whenever
the current foreground session is a descendant of the debugger.
<P>
<B>PgmName and PgmInputs Considerations</B>
<P>
The program identified by<I> PgmName</I> is executed directly, with no intermediate
secondary command (CMD.EXE) process. Alternatively, the program can be executed
indirectly through a secondary command (CMD.EXE) process by specifying CMD.EXE
for<I> PgmName</I>, and by specifying either /C or /K followed by the file
specification of the application to be loaded for<I> PgmInputs</I>. If the
/C parameter is inserted at the beginning of the<I> PgmInputs</I> string,
then when the application program ends, the session ends. If the /K parameter
is inserted at the beginning of the<I> PgmInputs</I> string, then when the
application ends, the operator sees the system command line prompt displayed.
The operator can then either enter the name of another program or command
to execute, or enter the EXIT command to end the session.
<P>
When the<I> PgmName</I> address is 0, or the ASCIIZ string is null, the
program identified by the<I> PgmHandle</I> is started in the new session.
If the<I> PgmHandle</I> is not specified, then the program specified as
a parameter to the protect mode shell on the OS2_SHELL statement, or on
the SHELL statement for a DOS session, in the configuration file (CONFIG.SYS)
is executed and passed the specified<I> PgmInputs</I>. The default is the
program name for the command processor (CMD.EXE for a non-DOS session, or
COMMAND.COM for a DOS session).
<P>
The<I> PgmName</I> and<I> PgmInputs</I> strings combined length may not
exceed 1024 characters.
<P>
<B>Program Handle Considerations</B>
<P>
If a process issues DosStartSession specifying only the program handle,
then it must change to the working directory before issuing DosStartSession,
and start the new process as inherited. If a process is started as non-inherited,
it is up to that process to change to the correct directory.
<P>
<B>Parent/Child Termination Considerations</B>
<P>
The parent must create the termination queue prior to specifying the queue
name on DosStartSession. The Session Manager will continue to notify the
parent session through the specified queue as long as the process issuing
DosStartSession remains a parent session. When all the child sessions for
a particular parent session end, the termination queue is closed by the
Session Manager. An existing queue name must be specified on the next DosStartSession
function if the caller wants to continue receiving termination notification
messages. The caller must use the same queue for all calls to DosStartSession.

<P>
The Session Manager writes a data element into the specified queue when
any child session ends. The queue is posted regardless of who terminates
the child session (for example, child, parent, or operator) and whether
the termination is normal or abnormal.
<P>
A parent session issues <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>to receive notification when a child session has ended. The word that
contains the request parameter, returned by <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>will be 0. The data element structure has the following format:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Size<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D DC C4 E4 -->USHORT</A><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Session
ID of child<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D DC C4 E4 -->USHORT</A><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Result
code<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The process that originally issued DosStartSession should issue <A HREF="1425_L2_DosReadQueue.html">DosReadQueue
</A>with the<I> wait</I> parameter set to 0. This is the only process that
has addressability to the notification data element. After reading and processing
the data element, the caller must free the segment containing the data element
by issuing <A HREF="542_L2_DosFreeMem.html">DosFreeMem</A>.
<P>
An application may use the termination queue for additional interprocess
communication, provided that a unique request identifier is passed via <A HREF="2006_L2_DosWriteQueue.html">DosWriteQueue</A>.
Request identifier values 0 through 99 are reserved for the operating system.
Request identifier values equal to or greater than 100 are available for
application use.
<P>
When a child session ends, the result code returned in the<I> TermQ</I> data
element is the result code of the program specified by<I> PgmName</I> assuming
either:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->the program is executed directly, with no intermediate
secondary command (CMD.EXE) process, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->the program is executed indirectly through a secondary
command (CMD.EXE) process, and the /C parameter is specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Otherwise, the result code of CMD.EXE is returned.
<P>
When a child session is executing in the foreground at the time it ends,
the parent session becomes the foreground session. When a parent session
ends, all child sessions that it created with DosStartSession, specifying
a value of 1 for<I> Related</I>, are ended. When an independent session,
created specifying a value of 0 for<I> Related</I>, ends in the foreground,
the<!-- entering slot 1817 --> Shell selects the next foreground session.

<P>
<B>Grandchildren Considerations</B>
<P>
A session started through DosStartSession may issue DosStartSession. The
following rules apply:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> pidSession</I>, specified on <A HREF="1526_L2_DosSelectSession.html">DosSelectSession</A>,
<A HREF="1744_L2_DosSetSession.html">DosSetSession</A>, and <A HREF="1812_L2_DosStopSession.html">DosStopSession
</A>may only be the session identifier (<I>pidSession</I>) of an immediate
child session, not a grandchild session or any descendant other than an
immediate child session.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a bond is established between session A and its

B and its immediate child session C, then if session A is selected, session
C is brought to the foreground. Refer to <A HREF="1744_L2_DosSetSession.html">DosSetSession
</A>for a description of what establishing a bond means.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
