<H1>DosResetBuffer - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1498 -->
<P>
When DosResetBuffer is issued for a file handle, the contents of the file's
buffers are written to the disk, and the file's directory entry is updated
as if the file had been closed; however, the file remains open.
<P>
DosResetBuffer should be issued with caution. When files are on diskettes,
issuing DosResetBuffer could have the undesirable effect of requiring the
user to insert and remove a large number of diskettes.
<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
Issuing DosResetBuffer for a named pipe results in an operation that is
similar to forcing the buffer cache to the disk. The request blocks the
calling process at one end of the pipe until all written data has been read
at the other end.
