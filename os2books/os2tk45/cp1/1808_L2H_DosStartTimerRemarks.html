<P>
DosStartTimer starts an asynchronous, repeated-interval timer, and posts
an event semaphore each time the specified time interval expires.
<P>
Time intervals for DosStartTimer, <A HREF="087_L2_DosAsyncTimer.html">DosAsyncTimer</A>,
and <A HREF="1781_L2_DosSleep.html">DosSleep</A> are specified in milliseconds;
however, it is important to recognize that the actual duration of the specified
time interval will be affected by two factors:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the system clock keeps track of time in less
precise units known as<I> clock ticks</I>. The duration of a clock tick
depends on the frequency of the system-clock interrupt that is used by your
computer. (To determine the duration of the clock tick on your computer,
issue <A HREF="1372_L2_DosQuerySysInfo.html">DosQuerySysInfo</A> and examine
the<I> timer-interval</I> field.)
<P>
Because clock ticks are less precise than millisecond values, any time interval
that is specified in milliseconds will be rounded up to the next clock tick.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, because the system is a priority-based, multitasking
operating system, there is no guarantee that a thread will resume immediately
after the timer interval expires. If a higher-priority process or thread
is running, or if a hardware interrupt occurs, the timed thread blocks.
(To minimize the inaccuracy caused by preemptive scheduling, an application
can dedicate a thread to managing time-critical tasks and then raise that
thread to a higher priority.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These factors usually cause the timer interval to be longer than requested;
however, it will generally be within a few clock ticks.
