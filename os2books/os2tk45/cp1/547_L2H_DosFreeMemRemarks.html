<P>
DosFreeMem releases a previously allocated private or shared memory object
from the virtual-address space of the subject process. The released pages
are given an access protection of no access.
<P>
Freeing a shared memory object decrements the reference count for the associated
object. If the resulting count is zero (that is, no other references to
the shared memory object exist throughout the system), then the object is
deleted. The deletion of the shared memory object releases the backing storage
for the committed pages within the object.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> and <A HREF="065_L2_DosAllocSharedMem.html">DosAllocSharedMem
</A>both allocate a block of memory of the size requested rounded to the
nearest page. On OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 64K object without attributes
on every allocation.
<P>
For example, for a <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> call
with a size of 1, the following occurs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, the system allocates a 4096-byte
block of committed memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 4096-byte block
of committed memory plus 61440 bytes without attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
When you allocate a memory object with the PAG_EXECUTE attribute, it is
implied that this memory object also has the PAG_READ attribute. However,
when querying the attributes of a memory object, you will get the following
results:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, both PAG_EXECUTE and PAG_READ
attributes are returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, only the PAG_EXECUTE attribute is returned.
However, PAG_READ is still implied.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
