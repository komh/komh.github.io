<P>
DosSelectSession allows a parent session to switch one of its child sessions
to the foreground. The session specified will not be brought to the foreground
unless the parent session or one of its descendant sessions is currently
executing in the foreground.
<P>
The foreground session for windowed applications is the session of the application
that owns the window focus.
<P>
DosSelectSession may only be issued by a parent session to select itself
or a child session. DosSelectSession may not be used to select a grandchild
session, or any other descendant session beyond a child session. DosSelectSession
may only be issued by the process that originally started the specified
session (<I>idSession</I>) through <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession</A>.

<P>
DosSelectSession may only be used to select child sessions that were originally
started by the caller with <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession
</A>specifying a value of 1 for<I> Related</I>. That is, sessions started
as independent sessions may not be selected through DosSelectSession.
<P>
When DosSelectSession is issued, the session specified will not be brought
to the foreground unless the parent session or one of its descendant sessions
is currently executing in the foreground.
<P>
Return code ERROR_SMG_NO_TARGET_WINDOW is a warning that the session might
not be brought to the foreground. If the selected session is a Presentation
Manager (PM) application, its window must be created with the FCF_TASKLIST
flag bit set on. If the window is created with this bit set off, its session
cannot be selected using DosSelectSession, and ERROR_SMG_NO_TARGET_WINDOW
is returned.
<P>
If you issue DosSelectSession before creating the PM window of the selected
session, ERROR_SMG_NO_TARGET_WINDOW is returned. However, if the PM window
of the selected session is subsequently created with the FCF_TASKLIST flag
bit set on, the window is brought to the foreground if the issuer of DosSelectSession
still owns the foreground focus.
<P>
If a session still exists but its window has been destroyed, and you issue
DosSelectSession for that session, ERROR_SMG_NO_TARGET_WINDOW is returned.
