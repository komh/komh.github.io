<H1>DosShutdown - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1796 -->
<P>
When<I> ulShutDownValue</I> equals 0, the full system is shut down and the
file-system is locked. In this case, DosShutdown can take several minutes
to complete its operation; the time depends on the amount of data in the
buffers.
<P>
If other functions that change file-system data are issued while the system
is shut down, either the return code ERROR_ALREADY_SHUTDOWN is set, or the
other function calls are blocked permanently.
<P>
Allocated memory cannot be increased once DosShutdown has been issued. This
means that in low-memory situations, some functions may fail because of
a lack of memory. This is of particular importance to the process issuing
DosShutdown. All memory that the calling process will ever need should be
allocated before DosShutdown is issued. This includes implicit memory allocations
that system functions make on behalf of DosShutdown.
<P>
When DosShutdown has completed successfully, the system can be powered-off
or restarted.
<P>
When<I> ulShutDownValue</I> equals 1, the system is quiescent (no threads
of execution are active) at the end of this function request, but the file-systems
are not locked, and processing can resume at a later time.
