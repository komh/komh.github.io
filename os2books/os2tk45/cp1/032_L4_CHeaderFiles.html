<P>
OS/2 functions that used to take a<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C4 3C --> PSZ
</A>as a parameter, and that do not modify the contents of the passed string,
have been updated in the C++ header files to take a<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C4 3B --> PCSZ
</A>data type parameter. The use of<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C4 3B --> PCSZ
</A>allows for better optimization by the compiler and is more semantically
compatible with C++. Existing code that calls functions that use<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C4 3C --> PSZ
</A>will continue to work correctly.
<P>
Several of the typedefs have been changed in the C++ header files. For example,
many items that are unsigned char in the C header files are char in the
C++ header files. For instance,
<PRE>
typedef unsigned char BYTE;

</PRE>
has changed to
<PRE>
typedef char BYTE;

</PRE>

<P>
The existing samples that are included in the IBM Developer's Toolkit for
OS/2 Warp Version 3 can be used with either set of the header files.
