<P>
DosAsyncTimer starts a single-interval timer. The timer runs asynchronously
to the calling thread, and posts an event semaphore when the specified time
interval expires.
<P>
Time intervals for DosAsyncTimer, <A HREF="1801_L2_DosStartTimer.html">DosStartTimer</A>,
and <A HREF="1781_L2_DosSleep.html">DosSleep</A>  are specified in milliseconds;
however, it is important to recognize that the actual duration of the specified
time interval will be affected by two factors:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the system clock keeps track of time in less
precise units known as<I> clock ticks</I>. The duration of a clock tick
depends on the frequency of the system-clock interrupt that is used by your
computer. (To determine the duration of the clock tick on your computer,
issue <A HREF="1372_L2_DosQuerySysInfo.html">DosQuerySysInfo</A> and examine
the timer-interval field.)
<P>
Because clock ticks are less precise than millisecond values, any time interval
that is specified in milliseconds will be rounded up to the next clock tick.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, because the system is a priority-based, multitasking
operating system, there is no guarantee that a thread will resume immediately
after the timer interval expires. If a higher-priority process or thread
is running, the timed thread blocks. (To minimize the inaccuracy caused
by preemptive scheduling, an application can dedicate a thread to managing
time-critical tasks, and then raise that thread to a higher priority.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These factors usually cause the timer interval to be longer than requested;
however, it will generally be within a few clock ticks.
