<B>pulUser</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D DB C4 28 -->PULONG</A>) - output
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>A pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D DB C4 38 --> ULONG
</A>in which a user-defined value is returned.
<P>
The user-defined value is received from the<I> ulUser</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C4 2F --> SEMRECORD
</A>structure of the semaphore that was posted or released.
<P>
If DCMW_WAIT_ANY was specified in the<I> flAttr</I>. parameter when the
muxwait semaphore was created, this will be the user field of the semaphore
that was posted or released. If the muxwait semaphore consists of mutex
semaphores, any mutex semaphore that is released is owned by the caller.

<P>
If DCMW_WAIT_ALL was specified in the<I> flAttr</I>. parameter when the
muxwait semaphore was created, this will be the user field of the last semaphore
that was posted or released. (If the thread did not block, the last semaphore
that was posted or released will also be the last semaphore in the muxwait-semaphore
list.) If the muxwait semaphore consists of mutex semaphores, all of the
mutex semaphores that are released are owned by the caller.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
