DosExitMustComplete notifies the system that the calling thread is leaving
a section of code in which any asynchronous exceptions (signals and asynchronous
process terminations) that may have occurred were held, rather than being
immediately delivered to the thread.
<P>
For a detailed list of the system exceptions, see<A><!-- external link: 1D 24 C5 2D --> System
