<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> When writing message pipes the application is limited to 64K
messages. As well, these messages cannot span 64k boundaries due to the
current design of the thunk layer in read or write routines. If the message
is not written in an aligned manner, the subsequent read will not be able
to handle the messages properly. If a 64k or less message is written to
a pipe from an aligned buffer, the read will handle this properly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
The requested number of bytes might not be read. If the value returned in
<I>pcbActual</I> is zero, the process tried to read from the end of the
file.
<P>
A value of zero for<I> cbRead</I> is not considered an error. In such a
case, the system treats the request as a null operation.
<P>
The file pointer is moved to the desired position by reading data, writing
data, or issuing <A HREF="1625_L2_DosSetFilePtr.html">DosSetFilePtr</A>.

<P>
If you issue <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A> with the Direct Open
flag set to 1 in the<I> fsOpenFlags</I> parameter, you have direct access
to an entire disk or diskette volume, independent of the file system. You
must lock the logical volume before accessing it, and you must unlock the
logical volume when you are finished accessing it. Issue <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C5 FC --> DSK_LOCKDRIVE
</A>to lock the logical volume, and for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C5 FC --> DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE
</A>to unlock the logical volume. While the logical volume is locked, no
other process can access it.
<P>
<B>Named Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
A named pipe is read as one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A byte pipe in byte-read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message pipe in message-read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message pipe in byte-read mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A byte pipe must be in byte-read mode to be read; an error is returned if
it is in message-read mode. All currently available data, up to the size
requested, is returned.
<P>
A message pipe can be read in either message-read mode or byte-read mode.
When the message pipe is in message-read mode, a read operation that is
larger than the next available message returns only that message.<I> pcbActual
</I>is set to indicate the size of the message returned.
<P>
A read operation that is smaller than the next available message returns
with the number of bytes requested and an ERROR_MORE_DATA return code. When
the reading of a message is resumed after ERROR_MORE_DATA is returned, a
read operation always blocks until the next piece (or the rest) of the message
can be transferred. <A HREF="821_L2_DosPeekNPipe.html">DosPeekNPipe</A> can
be issued to determine how many bytes are left in the message.
<P>
A message pipe in byte-read mode is read as if it were a byte stream, and
DosRead skips over message headers. This is like reading a byte pipe in
byte-read mode.
<P>
When blocking mode is set for a named pipe, a read operation blocks until
data is available. In this case, the read operation never returns with<I> pcbActual
</I>equal to zero, except when the pipe is closed. When the mode is set
to message-read, messages are always read in their entirety, except when
the message is bigger than the size of the read operation.
<P>
<I>pcbActual</I> can equal zero in nonblocking mode, but only when no data
is available at the time of the read operation.
<P>
If you attempt a read of a named pipe when the other end of the pipe is
closed while the read is pending, DosRead returns:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->pcbActual equal to 0<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>ulrc
equal to either 0 or ERROR_NO_DATA<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Unnamed Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
Threads writing to and reading from the same unnamed pipe are not synchronized.
It is possible for the pipe reader to obtain partial contents of a write
request if the pipe becomes full during the write request.
