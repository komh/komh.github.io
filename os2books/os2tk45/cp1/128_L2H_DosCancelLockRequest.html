<P>
DosCancelLockRequest allows a process to cancel the lock range request of
an outstanding <A HREF="1612_L2_DosSetFileLocks.html">DosSetFileLocks</A> function.

<P>
If two threads in a process are waiting on a lock file range, and another
thread issues DosCancelLockRequest for that lock file range, then both waiting
threads are released.
<P>
Not all file-system drivers (FSDs) can cancel an outstanding lock request.

<P>
Local Area Network (LAN) servers cannot cancel an outstanding lock request
if they use a version of the operating system prior to OS/2 Version 2.00.
