<P>
DosWaitThread is used to wait for termination of threads within a process.
It is usually used so that thread resources (for example, the stack) can
be recovered when a thread ends. DosWaitThread waits on any thread within
the current process, or on a specific thread within the process, based on
the<I> ptid</I> parameter's contents.<I> option</I> allows the caller the
option of waiting until a thread ends, or getting immediate return and status.
If no thread has ended and the DCWW_NOWAIT option is specified, the<I> ptid
</I>field is preserved.
<P>
If DosWaitThread is called with the input<I> ptid</I> set to the current
thread (the thread attempts to wait on its own termination), the ERROR_INVALID_THREADID
error code is returned. ERROR_INVALID_THREADID is also returned if a caller
attempts to wait on the termination of the thread with a<I> ptid</I> of
1.
