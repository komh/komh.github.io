<P>
A queue is a named, ordered list of elements that is used to pass information
between related or unrelated processes. The owner of the queue (the server
process) can choose the order in which to read incoming information and
can examine queue elements without removing them from the queue. Queue elements
can be added and accessed in First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Last-In-First-Out
(LIFO), or priority-based order.
