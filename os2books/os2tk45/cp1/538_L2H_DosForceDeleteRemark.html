<P>
Read-only files cannot be deleted by DosForceDelete. To delete a read-only
file, you must first issue <A HREF="1600_L2_DosSetFileInfo.html">DosSetFileInfo
</A>to change the file's read-only attribute to zero, then delete the file.

<P>
The deleted file cannot be recovered with the UNDELETE command. You may
want to issue DosForceDelete to delete a temporary file that you would not
want to recover.
<P>
DosForceDelete cannot be used to delete directories. Issue <A HREF="315_L2_DosDeleteDir.html">DosDeleteDir
</A>to delete a directory.
