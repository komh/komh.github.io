Debugging is the process of detecting, diagnosing, and eliminating errors
in programs. A debugger program is designed to interact with the application
that it is debugging. Because of the protected mode architecture of the
OS/2 operating system, special steps must be taken to allow a debugging
program to perform its functions in the program being debugged. <A HREF="298_L2_DosDebug.html">DosDebug
</A>enables one application to control the execution of another application
for debugging purposes.
