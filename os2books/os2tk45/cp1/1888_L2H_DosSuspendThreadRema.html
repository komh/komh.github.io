<H1>DosSuspendThread - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1908 -->
<P>
A thread's execution is suspended when another thread in its process issues
DosSuspendThread, specifying the ID of the target thread. The thread may
not be suspended immediately because it may have locked some system resources
that have to be freed first. However, the thread is not allowed to execute
further application program instructions until a corresponding <A HREF="1494_L2_DosResumeThread.html">DosResumeThread
</A>is issued.
<P>
DosSuspendThread permits the suspension of only one other thread within
the current process. If a thread needs to disable all thread switching within
its process so that the calling thread can execute time-critical code, it
issues <A HREF="392_L2_DosEnterCritSec.html">DosEnterCritSec</A> and <A HREF="470_L2_DosExitCritSec.html">DosExitCritSec</A>.

<P>
<A HREF="712_L2_DosKillThread.html">DosKillThread</A> will not terminate
a thread that is suspended. Instead the suspended thread will be terminated
when it resumes execution. For this reason, you should not kill the main
thread of an application if there are any secondary threads that are suspended.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function is very powerful and must be used with extreme
caution. It should be used only when the state of the target thread is known.
