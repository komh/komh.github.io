<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> When writing message pipes the application is limited to 64K
messages. As well, these messages cannot span 64k boundaries due to the
current design of the thunk layer in read or write routines. If the message
is not written in an aligned manner, the subsequent read will not be able
to handle the messages properly. If a 64k or less message is written to
a pipe from an aligned buffer, the read will handle this properly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
DosWrite begins to write at the current file-pointer position. The file
pointer is automatically moved by read and write operations. It can be moved
to a desired position by issuing <A HREF="1625_L2_DosSetFilePtr.html">DosSetFilePtr</A>.

<P>
If the specified file has been opened using the write-through flag, DosWrite
writes the data to the disk before returning. Upon return to the caller,
<I>pcbActual</I> contains the number of bytes actually written.
<P>
If there is not enough space on the disk or diskette to write all of the
bytes specified by<I> cbWrite</I> then DosWrite does not write any bytes.
Upon return to the caller,<I> pcbActual</I> contains zero.
<P>
A value of zero for<I> cbWrite</I> is not considered an error. No data transfer
occurs, and there is no effect on the file or the file pointer.
<P>
If the file is read-only, the write operation to the file is not performed.

<P>
If you issue <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A> with the Direct Open
flag set to 1 in the<I> fsOpenMode</I> parameter, you have direct access
to an entire disk or diskette volume, independent of the file system. You
must lock the logical volume before accessing it, and you must unlock the
logical volume when you are finished accessing it. Issue <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C5 FC --> DSK_LOCKDRIVE
</A>to lock the logical volume, and for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C5 FC --> DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE
</A>to unlock the logical volume. While the logical volume is locked, no
other process can access it.
<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosWrite also is used to write bytes or messages to a named pipe.
<P>
Each write operation to a message pipe writes a message whose size is the
length of the write operation. DosWrite automatically encodes message lengths
in the pipe, so applications need not encode this information in the buffer
being written.
<P>
Write operations in blocking mode always write all requested bytes before
returning.
<P>
In nonblocking mode, DosWrite returns either with all bytes written or none
written. DosWrite returns with no bytes written when it would have to divide
the message into blocks in order to complete the request. This can occur
when there is not enough space left in the pipe, or when the pipe is currently
being written to by another client. If this occurs, DosWrite returns immediately
with a value of zero for<I> pcbActual</I>, indicating that no bytes were
written.
<P>
For a byte pipe, if the number of bytes to be written exceeds the space
available in the pipe, DosWrite writes as many bytes as it can, and returns
with the number of bytes actually written in<I> pcbActual</I>.
<P>
An attempt to write to a pipe whose other end has been closed returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE
or, if the other end was closed without reading all pending data, ERROR_DISCARDED.

<P>
Clients of named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND access mode cannot
use the DosWrite function. If the named pipe's client uses the DosWrite
function, the function returns error code ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
