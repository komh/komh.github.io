<P>
DosQueryNPHState returns the following information about a pipe handle and
the attributes of the pipe:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The end of the pipe that the handle is for (server
or client end)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The pipe type (byte pipe or message pipe)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The instance count<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The blocking mode (blocking or nonblocking)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The read mode (byte-read mode or message-read mode).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The values for the pipe type and instance count cannot be changed, so they
are always the same as those that were specified when the pipe was created
with <A HREF="251_L2_DosCreateNPipe.html">DosCreateNPipe</A>. The information
returned for blocking mode and read mode, however, can come from different
sources:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the handle is for the server end of the pipe, then
the blocking mode and the read mode were set with <A HREF="251_L2_DosCreateNPipe.html">DosCreateNPipe</A>,
but may have been reset with <A HREF="1679_L2_DosSetNPHState.html">DosSetNPHState</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the handle is for the client end of the pipe, then
the blocking mode and the read mode were set to "blocking" and "byte-read"
by the system when the client issued <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.
However, they may have been reset with <A HREF="1679_L2_DosSetNPHState.html">DosSetNPHState</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
