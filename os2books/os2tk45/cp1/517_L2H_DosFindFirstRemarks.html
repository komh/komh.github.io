<H1>DosFindFirst - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 525 -->
<P>
The result buffer from DosFindFirst should be less than 64KB.
<P>
DosFindFirst returns directory entries (up to the number requested in<I> pcFileNames</I>)
and extended-attribute information for as many files or subdirectories whose
names, attributes, and EAs match the specification, and whose information
fits in<I> pfindbuf</I>. On output,<I> pcFileNames</I> contains the actual
number of directory entries returned.
<P>
The file name pointed to by<I> pszFileSpec</I> can contain global file-name
characters.
<P>
<A HREF="521_L2_DosFindNext.html">DosFindNext</A> uses the directory handle
associated with DosFindFirst to continue the search started by the DosFindFirst
request.
<P>
Any nonzero return code, except ERROR_EAS_DIDNT_FIT, indicates that no handle
has been allocated. This includes such nonerror indicators as ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES.

<P>
For ERROR_EAS_DIDNT_FIT, a search handle is returned, and a subsequent call
to <A HREF="521_L2_DosFindNext.html">DosFindNext</A> gets the next matching
entry in the directory. You can use <A HREF="1314_L2_DosQueryPathInfo.html">DosQueryPathInfo
</A>to retrieve the EAs for the matching entry by using the same EA arguments
used for the DosFindFirst call, and the name that was returned by DosFindFirst.

<P>
For ERROR_EAS_DIDNT_FIT, only information for the first matching entry is
returned. This entry is the one whose extended attributes did not fit in
the buffer. The information returned is in the format of that returned for
information Level 2. No further entries are returned in the buffer, even
if they could fit in the remaining space.
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 49 --> GEA2</A> list contained inside
<I>pfindbuf</I> during a Level 3 DosFindFirst and <A HREF="521_L2_DosFindNext.html">DosFindNext
</A>call is not "read-only", it is used by OS/2. When the function returns,
the list is restored to it's original state, but inside the function, the
list is manipulated by OS/2. This is of concern to a multithreaded application,
where two different threads might use the same<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 49 --> GEA2
</A>list as input. If one thread calls DosFindFirst or <A HREF="521_L2_DosFindNext.html">DosFindNext
</A>while another thread is inside DosFindFirst or <A HREF="521_L2_DosFindNext.html">DosFindNext</A>,
the second thread will fail with a return code of ERROR_BAD_FORMAT.
