<P>
DosCopy copies all files and subdirectories in the source path to the target
path. Global file-name characters are not allowed in source or target names.
The source and the target can be on different drives.
<P>
If an I/O error occurs, DosCopy takes the following actions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the source name is that of a subdirectory, deletes
the file being copied from the target path.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the source name is that of a file to be replaced,
deletes the file from the target path.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the source name is that of a file to be appended,
resizes the target file to its original size.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Read-only files in the target path cannot be replaced by a DosCopy request.
If such files exist in the target, and<I> option</I> bit flag DCPY_EXISTING
is set to 1, any attempt to replace these files with files from the source
will result in an error.
<P>
When copying is specified for a single file that has<I> option</I> bit flag
DCPY_APPEND set to 1, the operation proceeds even if the file already exists
and its<I> option</I> bit flag DCPY_EXISTING is set to 0. That is,<I> option
</I>bit flag DCPY_EXISTING is significant only when replacing a file, not
when appending a file.
<P>
If a device name is specified as the target, the source name must be a file,
not a directory. When the request is issued,<I> option</I> bit flags DCPY_EXISTING
and DCPY_APPEND are ignored.
<P>
File-object attributes, such as date of creation, and time of creation,
are always copied from the source to the target; however, extended attributes
(EAs) are not copied in every case. DosCopy copies EAs from the source to
the target when creating a file or directory, or when replacing an existing
file on the target; however, it does not copy them when appending an existing
file or when copying files to an existing directory on the target. If the
file system of the target does not support EAs, DosCopy ends and returns
an error.
<P>
If the source file object contains a needed EA, and the destination file
system does not support EAs, DosCopy fails regardless of the value of<I> option
</I>bit flag DCPY_FAILEAS.
