<H1>DosSetFileLocks - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1639 -->
<P>
DosSetFileLocks allows a process to lock and unlock a range in a file. The
time during which a file range is locked should be short.
<P>
If the lock and unlock ranges are both zero, ERROR_LOCK_VIOLATION is returned
to the caller.
<P>
If you only want to lock a file range, set the unlock file offset and the
unlock range length to zero.
<P>
If you only want to unlock a file range, set the lock file offset and the
lock range length to zero.
<P>
When the Atomic bit of<I> flags</I> is set to 0, and DosSetFileLocks specifies
a lock operation and an unlock operation, the unlock operation occurs first,
and then the lock operation is performed. If an error occurs during the
unlock operation, an error code is returned and the lock operation is not
performed. If an error occurs during the lock operation, an error code is
returned and the unlock remains in effect if it was successful.
<P>
The lock operation is atomic when all of these conditions are met:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Atomic bit is set to 1 in<I> flags</I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The unlock range is the same as the lock range<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The process has shared access to the file range, and
has requested exclusive access to it; or the process has exclusive access
to the file range, and has requested shared access to it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some file system drivers (FSDs) may not support atomic lock operations.
Versions of the operating system prior to OS/2 Version 2.00 do not support
atomic lock operations. If the application receives the error code ERROR_ATOMIC_LOCK_NOT_SUPPORTED,
the application should unlock the file range and then lock it using a non-atomic
operation (with the atomic bit set to 0 in<I> flags</I>). The application
should also refresh its internal buffers before making any changes to the
file.
<P>
If you issue <A HREF="132_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose</A> to close a file
with locks still in effect, the locks are released in no defined sequence.

<P>
If you end a process with a file open, and you have locks in effect in that
file, the file is closed and the locks are released in no defined sequence.

<P>
The locked range can be anywhere in the logical file. Locking beyond the
end of the file is not an error. A file range to be locked exclusively must
first be cleared of any locked file subranges or overlapping locked file
ranges.
<P>
If you repeat DosSetFileLocks for the same file handle and file range, then
you duplicate access to the file range. Access to locked file ranges is
not duplicated across <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A>. The
proper method of using locks is to attempt to lock the file range, and to
examine the return value.
<P>
The following table shows the level of access granted when the accessed
file range is locked with an exclusive lock or a shared lock. "Owner" refers
to a process that owns the lock. "Non-owner" refers to a process that does
not own the lock.

<P>
If only locking is specified, DosSetFileLocks locks the specified file range
using<I> pflLock</I>. If the lock operation cannot be accomplished, an error
is returned, and the file range is not locked.
<P>
After the lock request is processed, a file range can be unlocked using
the<I> pflUnlock</I> parameter of another DosSetFileLocks request. If unlocking
cannot be accomplished, an error is returned.
<P>
Instead of denying read/write access to an entire file by specifying access
and sharing modes with <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A> requests,
a process attempts to lock only the range needed for read/write access and
examines the error code returned.
<P>
Once a specified file range is locked exclusively, read and write access
by another process is denied until the file range is unlocked. If both unlocking
and locking are specified by DosSetFileLocks, the unlocking operation is
performed first, then locking is done.
