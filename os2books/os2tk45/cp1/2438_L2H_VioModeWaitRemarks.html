<P>

<P>
At the completion of an application or hard-error pop-up (see <A HREF="2440_L2_VioPopUp.html">VioPopUp</A>),
the OS/2 operating system notifies the session that was originally interrupted
for the pop-up to restore its mode. The return from VioModeWait provides
that notification. The thread that issued the call must perform the restore
and then immediately reissue VioModeWait.
<P>
When an application's VioModeWait thread is notified, the thread must restore
its video mode, state, and modified display-adapter registers. An application's
VioModeWait thread does not restore the physical display buffer. The OS/2
operating system saves and/or restores the physical display buffer over
a pop-up.
<P>
Only one process for a session can issue VioModeWait. The first process
that issues VioModeWait becomes the owner of this function. (See <A HREF="2422_L2_VioModeUndo.html">VioModeUndo</A>.)

<P>
An application must issue VioModeWait only if it writes directly to the
registers on the display adapter. Otherwise, the application can allow the
OS/2 operating system to perform the required restoration by not issuing
VioModeWait.
<P>
When an application issues VioModeWait, it is also required to issue <A HREF="2494_L2_VioSavRedrawWait.html">VioSavRedrawWait
</A>to be notified at screen switch time to perform a full save or restoration
(see <A HREF="2494_L2_VioSavRedrawWait.html">VioSavRedrawWait</A>). Two
application threads must be dedicated to performing these operations.
