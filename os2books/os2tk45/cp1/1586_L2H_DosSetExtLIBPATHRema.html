<P>
The LIBPATH string is an environment variable found in the CONFIG.SYS file
consisting of a set of paths. If a fully-qualified path is not specified
when a module is loaded, the system searches these paths to find the DLL.

<P>
There are two extended LIBPATH strings, BeginLIBPATH and EndLIBPATH. BeginLIBPATH
is searched before the system LIBPATH, and EndLIBPATH is searched after
both BeginLIBPATH and the system LIBPATH. These extended LIBPATHs can be
set either from the command line using the "SET" command, or by calling
DosSetExtLIBPATH. When DosSetExtLIBPATH is called, all modifications become
specific to that process. Initial settings can be set for all processes
in the system by setting the values in CONFIG.SYS using the "set" command.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The extended LIBPATHs are not true environment variables,
and do not appear when querying the environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Every process inherits the settings of BeginLIBPATH and EndLIBPATH from
the process that starts it. If the extended library paths are initialized
in CONFIG.SYS, those extended library paths become the initial settings
for new processes. If a process changes BeginLIBPATH or EndLIBPATH and starts
a new process, the new child process inherits the changed contents. Child
processes that inherit their parent's extended LIBPATHs maintain their own
copy. Modifications made by the parent after the child has been created
have no effect on the children.
<P>
This function permits the use of two symbols within the path string: %BeginLIBPATH%
and %EndLIBPATH%. These symbols are replaced with the current string settings
for the extended library paths. For example, if BeginLIBPATH is set to
<PRE>
d:\MYDLLS;

</PRE>
and your application calls
<PRE>
DosSetExtLIBPATH("d:\TOMSDLLS;%BeginLIBPATH%;d:\JOESDLLS;", 1);

</PRE>
the resulting BeginLIBPATH is
<PRE>
d:\TOMSDLLS;d:\MYDLLS;d:\JOESDLLS;

</PRE>

<P>
The LIBPATHs strings are only searched when the specified DLL is not currently
loaded. The only way to guarantee that the DLL being used is the correct
version is to set the fully-qualified path in <A HREF="721_L2_DosLoadModule.html">DosLoadModule</A>.
When a request is made to load a module and a path is not specified, the
system searches the paths in the LIBPATH string and uses the first instance
of the specified DLL it finds. If the new paths are added to the search
strings, the system does not check those directories to see if a different
version exists. Consequently, if two processes started from different directories
use the same DLL, but different versions of that DLL exist in both directories,
the version of the DLL loaded by the first process is the one used by both
processes. The only way to prevent this from occurring is to specify the
path to the DLL when <A HREF="721_L2_DosLoadModule.html">DosLoadModule</A> is
called.
<P>
Consequently, if one process sets its BeginLIBPATH to C:\PROCESS1\DLL and
loads the DLL MYAPP.DLL from that directory, and then a second process sets
its BeginLIBPATH to C:\PROCESS2\DLL and there is for a different version
of MYAPP.DLL in C:\PROCESS2\DLL, the second process will link to the DLL
from C:\PROCESS1\DLL since it was already loaded.
<P>
Both BeginLIBPATH and EndLIBPATH can be set from the command line using
the SET command. For more information about setting LIBPATHS from the command
line, see the<I> OS/2 Command Reference</I>.
