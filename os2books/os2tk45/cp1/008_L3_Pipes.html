<P>
A pipe is a named or unnamed buffer used to pass data between processes.
A process writes to or reads from a pipe as though the pipe were standard
input or standard output. A parent process can use pipes to control the
input that a child process receives and to receive the output that the child
process produces. There are two types of pipes-named and unnamed.
