<P>
DosWaitChild waits for completion of a child process whose execution is
asynchronous to that of its parent process. The child process is created
by <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> with a value of 2 specified
for<I> execFlag</I>. If the child process has multiple threads, the result
code returned by DosWaitChild is the one passed to it by the <A HREF="460_L2_DosExit.html">DosExit
</A>request that ends the process.
<P>
DosWaitChild also can wait for the completion of descendant processes of
a child process before it returns. However, it does not report status for
descendant processes.
<P>
If there are no child processes (either active, or ended but with a return
code), then DosWaitChild returns an error. If no child processes have ended,
DosWaitChild can wait until one ends before returning to the parent process.

<P>
To verify that a given return code is from a specific child process, the
process identifier must be checked.
<P>
To wait for all child processes and descendants to end, it is necessary
to:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Issue DosWaitChild with a value of 0 for<I> pid
</I>(wait until<I> any</I> child process has ended).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When this DosWaitChild returns, issue a DosWaitChild
request with<I> pid</I> equal to the value returned for<I> ppid</I> on the
previous DosWaitChild request, and a value of 1 for<I> action</I> (wait
for the indicated process and<I> all</I> its child processes).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Repeat steps 1 and 2 above until the "No child
process exists" return code is received.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
DosWaitChild will wait for any child processes, regardless of whether or
not they were executed with a result code (by calling <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm
</A>with a value of 2 for<I> execFlag</I>). DosWaitChild will not return
to the caller until a process<I> with</I> a return code ends, or until there
are no more child processes (of any type) to wait for.
