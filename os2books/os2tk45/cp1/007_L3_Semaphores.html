<P>
Semaphores signal the beginning and ending of an operation and provide mutually
exclusive ownership of resources. Typically, semaphores are used to prevent
more than one process or thread within a process from accessing a resource,
such as shared memory, at the same time.
<P>
Semaphores are defined by the system and reside in an internal memory buffer.
They are divided into three types, according to the functionality they provide:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Event semaphores enable a thread to notify waiting
threads that an event has occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Mutual exclusion (mutex) semaphores enable threads
to serialize their access to shared resources.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multiple Wait (muxwait) semaphores enable threads
to wait either for multiple events to occur, or for multiple resources to
become available.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
