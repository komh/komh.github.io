<P>
DosWriteQueue adds an element to the specified queue. A client process must
request access to the queue by calling <A HREF="800_L2_DosOpenQueue.html">DosOpenQueue
</A>before it can issue this function. The server process and its threads
do not need to issue <A HREF="800_L2_DosOpenQueue.html">DosOpenQueue</A> because
they already have access to the queue.
<P>
If the queue was created as a priority-based queue (as specified in the
<I>priority</I> parameter of <A HREF="275_L2_DosCreateQueue.html">DosCreateQueue</A>),
then the priority of the element that is being added must be specified.

<P>
If the server process has closed the queue before this request is issued,
ERROR_QUE_INVALID_HANDLE is returned.
