<P>
A multitasking operating system must manage applications carefully. A serious
error (such as an attempt to access protected memory) occurring in one application
cannot be permitted to damage any other application in the system. To manage
errors that might damage other applications, the OS/2 operating system defines
a class of error conditions called<I> exceptions</I> and defines default
actions for those errors.
<P>
An exception is an abnormal condition that can occur during program execution.
Common causes of exceptions include I/O errors and access protection violations.
When an exception is caused by the user pressing Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C, the
exception is called a signal exception.
<P>
When an exception occurs, the default action usually taken by the operating
system is to terminate the application that caused the exception. An application
can register its own exception handling routine and try to handle the exception
itself. It might be possible for the application to correct the condition
that caused the exception and continue execution.
