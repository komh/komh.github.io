<P>

<P>
DosConnectNPipe is issued by a server process to put a named pipe into the
listening state. This enables a client process to gain access to the pipe
by calling <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.
<P>
If the client end of the pipe is already open when DosConnectNPipe is issued,
DosConnectNPipe returns immediately and has no effect. If the client end
is closed, the result depends on whether the pipe is in blocking mode or
nonblocking mode. (Blocking/nonblocking mode is specified when the pipe
is created; it can also be changed by <A HREF="1679_L2_DosSetNPHState.html">DosSetNPHState</A>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the pipe is in blocking mode, DosConnectNPipe waits
for a client to open the pipe before returning.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the pipe is in nonblocking mode, DosConnectNPipe
returns immediately with ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED. Nevertheless, the pipe
is placed into the listening state, permitting a client to subsequently
issue <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A> successfully.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Multiple DosConnectNPipe calls can be issued for a pipe that is in nonblocking
mode. If the pipe is not already either open or closing, the first call
to DosConnectNPipe puts the pipe into the listening state; subsequent calls
merely test the pipe state.
<P>
If the pipe was previously opened and then closed by a client, but has not
yet been disconnected by the server, DosConnectNPipe returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.

<P>
If the function is interrupted while it is waiting for a client to open
the pipe, ERROR_INTERRUPT is returned.
<P>
If DosConnectNPipe is called by a client process, ERROR_BAD_PIPE is returned.

<P>
Also, ERROR_BAD_PIPE is returned if you specify an invalid name or file
handle.
