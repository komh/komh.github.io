<P>
The operating system does not guarantee the write order for multiple-sector
write operations. If an application requires several sectors to be written
in a specific order, the operator should issue the sectors as separate synchronous-write
operations. Setting the Write-Through flag does not affect any previous
write operation. That data can remain in the buffers.
<P>
When the application cannot handle a critical error that occurs, critical-error
handling can be reset to the system. This is done by having DosSetFHState
turn off the fail/errors bit, and then reissuing the I/O operation. The
expected critical error recurs, and control is passed to the system critical-error
handler. The precise time that the effect of this function is visible at
the application level is unpredictable when asynchronous I/O operations
are pending.
<P>
The file-handle-state bits set by this function can be queried by <A HREF="1155_L2_DosQueryFHState.html">DosQueryFHState</A>.

<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
With DosSetFHState, the inheritance (I) bit and Write-Through (W) bit can
be set or reset. Setting W to 1 prevents write-behind operations on remote
pipes.
