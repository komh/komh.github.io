<H1>DosClose - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 140 -->
<P>
Issuing DosClose with the handle to a file closes a handle to a file, pipe,
or device.
<P>
If additional handles to a file were created with <A HREF="369_L2_DosDupHandle.html">DosDupHandle</A>,
DosClose must be issued for the duplicate handles before the directory is
updated, and information in internal buffers is written to the medium.
<P>
Closing a device handle causes the device to be notified of the close, if
appropriate.
<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosClose closes a named pipe by handle.  When all handles that refer to
one end of a pipe are closed, the pipe is considered broken.
<P>
If the client end closes, no other process can reopen the pipe until the
serving end issues <A HREF="360_L2_DosDisConnectNPipe.html">DosDisConnectNPipe</A>,
followed by <A HREF="185_L2_DosConnectNPipe.html">DosConnectNPipe</A>.
<P>
If the server end closes when the pipe is already broken, the pipe is immediately
deallocated; otherwise, it is not deallocated until the last client handle
is closed.
