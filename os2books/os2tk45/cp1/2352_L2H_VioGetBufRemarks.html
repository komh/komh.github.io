<P>
An application using VioGetBuf can prepare a screen in the application's
own logical video buffer (LVB) offline.  When the application is in the
foreground, the physical screen buffer is updated from the LVB when VioShowBuf
is issued. When the application runs in the background, the physical screen
buffer is updated when the application is switched to the foreground.
<P>
Once VioGetBuf is issued, all VioWrtXX calls issued while the application
is running in the foreground are written to the physical display buffer
and LVB.
<P>
VioGetMode can be used to determine the dimensions of the buffer.
<P>
If <A HREF="2622_L2_VioSetMode.html">VioSetMode</A> is issued following
a VioGetBuf call, the size of the LVB is changed, and VioGetBuf must be
reissued.
