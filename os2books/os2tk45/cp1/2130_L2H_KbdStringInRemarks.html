<P>
This function is retained only for compatibility. New code should not use
it. <A HREF="2035_L2_KbdGetConsole.html">KbdGetConsole</A> is the preferred
function for new code.
<P>
The contents and ending condition depend on the keyboard state:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
ASCII<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL> Only valid characters are placed in the input
buffer. The function ends when a turnaround character is found or when the
buffer is full. The turnaround character is not placed in the buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BINARY
<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>Both valid characters and extended keys are returned.
The extended keys are returned as two-byte strings with a leading 0x00 or
0xe0 character. The function ends when the buffer is full.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TERM
<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>Valid characters and escape sequences are placed
in the input buffer. The function ends when the turnaround character is
found, when an escape sequence is complete, or when the buffer is full.
The turnaround character is placed in the buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The maximum buffer length is 255 bytes.
<P>
The character strings can be optionally echoed on the display if echo mode
is set. When echo is on, each character is echoed as it is read from the
keyboard. Echo mode and binary mode are mutually exclusive. See <A HREF="2076_L2_KbdGetStatus.html">KbdGetStatus
</A>and <A HREF="2114_L2_KbdSetStatus.html">KbdSetStatus</A> for more information.

<P>
The default input mode is ASCII. In ASCII mode, 2-byte character codes only
return in complete form. An extended ASCII code is returned in a 2-byte
string. The first byte is 0DH or E0H and the next byte is an extended code.

<P>
In input mode (binary or ASCII), the following returns can be set and retrieved
with <A HREF="2076_L2_KbdGetStatus.html">KbdGetStatus</A> and <A HREF="2114_L2_KbdSetStatus.html">KbdSetStatus</A>:

<P>
The received input length is also used by the KbdStringIn line edit functions
for re-displaying and entering a caller-specified string. On the next KbdStringIn
call the received input length indicates the length of the input buffer
that can be recalled by the user using the line-editing keys. A value of
0 inhibits the line-editing function for the current KbdStringIn request.
