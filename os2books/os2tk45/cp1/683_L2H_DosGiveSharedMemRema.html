<P>
DosGiveSharedMem gives another process access to a shared memory object.

<P>
Giving access to a shared memory object allocates the virtual address (of
the shared memory object) in the virtual-address space of the target process.
This is similar to the target process' performing a <A HREF="666_L2_DosGetSharedMem.html">DosGetSharedMem
</A>operation on the specified shared memory object.
<P>
The virtual address of the giveable shared memory object is the base address
assigned when the giveable shared memory object was created.  The creating
and receiving processes must use some form of InterProcess Communication
(IPC) to exchange this value.
<P>
Giveable shared memory objects are mapped at the same virtual address in
all processes that obtain access to the shared memory object.
<P>
The shared memory object specified by the virtual address must be giveable
(that is, it must have been created with the OBJ_GIVEABLE attribute set
on a call to <A HREF="065_L2_DosAllocSharedMem.html">DosAllocSharedMem</A>).

<P>
The desired access protection applied to committed pages must be compatible
with the access protection granted to the shared memory object when it was
created.
<P>
With the Intel 80386 processor, execute and read access are equivalent.
Also, write access implies both read and execute access.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> and <A HREF="065_L2_DosAllocSharedMem.html">DosAllocSharedMem
</A>both allocate a block of memory of the size requested rounded to the
nearest page. On OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 64K object without attributes
on every allocation.
<P>
For example, for a <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> call
with a size of 1, the following occurs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, the system allocates a 4096-byte
block of committed memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 4096-byte block
of committed memory plus 61440 bytes without attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
When you allocate a memory object with the PAG_EXECUTE attribute, it is
implied that this memory object also has the PAG_READ attribute. However,
when querying the attributes of a memory object, you will get the following
results:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, both PAG_EXECUTE and PAG_READ
attributes are returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, only the PAG_EXECUTE attribute is returned.
However, PAG_READ is still implied.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
