<H1>Memory Management</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
The key features of OS/2 memory management are paged virtual memory and
a 32-bit linear (flat) address space that is mapped through page tables
to physical memory. This is in contrast to the segmented memory model used
in previous versions of the operating system.
<P>
An application can allocate memory for its own use or to be shared with
other applications.
