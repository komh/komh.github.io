<P>
DosTransactNPipe is intended for use only on a duplex message pipe that
is in message-read mode. If this function is issued for a pipe that is not
a duplex message pipe, ERROR_BAD_FORMAT is returned.
<P>
The current setting of the pipe's blocking mode has no effect on this function;
that is, even if the pipe is in nonblocking mode, DosTransactNPipe writes
the entire<I> pOutbuf</I> to the pipe, and does not return until it reads
a response from the pipe into<I> pInbuf</I>. If<I> pInbuf</I> is too small
to contain the response message, ERROR_MORE_DATA is returned.
<P>
The function does not succeed if there is any unread data in the pipe, or
if the pipe is not in message-read mode.
<P>
Clients of named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND or NP_ACCESS_INBOUND
access mode cannot use the DosTransactNPipe function. If the named pipe's
client uses the DosTransactNPipe function, the function returns error code
ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
<P>
An attempt to write to a pipe whose other end has been closed returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE
or, if the other end was closed without reading all pending data, ERROR_DISCARDED.
