<P>
DosMove can be used to change only the name of a file or subdirectory, allowing
the file object to remain in the same subdirectory. Global file-name characters
are not allowed in the source or target name.
<P>
If the specified paths are different, the subdirectory location of the file
object is changed also. If a drive is specified for the target, it must
be the same as the one specified or implied by the source.
<P>
Attempts to move a parent subdirectory to one of its descendant subdirectories
result in error code 251 (ERROR_DIRECTORY_IN_CDS) because a subdirectory
cannot be both an ancestor and a descendant of the same subdirectory.
<P>
Attempts to move the current subdirectory or any of its ancestors for the
current process, or any other process, will be rejected.
<P>
Attributes (times and dates) of the source file object are moved to the
target. If read-only files exist in the target path, they are not replaced.

<P>
During initialization by an application, <A HREF="1372_L2_DosQuerySysInfo.html">DosQuerySysInfo
</A>is called to determine the maximum path length allowed by the operating
system.
<P>
DosMove can be used to change the case of a file on a drive that is controlled
by a file system driver (FSD). The following example would change the name
of the file to "File.Txt.".
<PRE>
DosMove("file.txt","File.Txt")
