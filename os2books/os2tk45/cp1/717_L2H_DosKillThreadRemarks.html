<P>
DosKillThread allows a thread to end another thread in the current process.

<P>
DosKillThread returns to the caller without waiting for the ending thread
to complete its termination processing.
<P>
You cannot use this function to end the current thread. If you use DosKillThread
to end thread 1, the entire process ends. This is similar to issuing <A HREF="460_L2_DosExit.html">DosExit
</A>for thread 1.
<P>
If the thread to be ended is executing 16-bit code, or has been created
by a 16-bit request, ERROR_BUSY is returned.
<P>
This function will not terminate a thread that is suspended. Instead the
suspended thread will be terminated when it resumes execution. For this
reason, you should not kill the main thread of an application if there are
any secondary threads that are suspended.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function is very powerful and must be used with extreme
caution. It should be used only when the state of the target thread is known.
