<P>
DosSetProcessCp sets the process code page of the calling process. The code
page of a process is used in the following ways:
<P>
First, the printer code page is set to the process code page through the
file system and printer spooler (the system spooler must be installed) when
the process makes a request to open the printer. Calling DosSetProcessCp
does not affect the code page of a printer opened prior to the call, and
does not affect the code page of a printer opened by another process.
<P>
Second, country-dependent information, by default, is retrieved encoded
in the code page of the calling process.
<P>
Third, a newly-created process inherits its process code page from its parent
process.
<P>
DosSetProcessCp does not affect the display or keyboard code page.
