<P>
DosPeekNPipe examines the current contents of a named pipe without removing
it. It also returns information about the state of the pipe.
<P>
DosPeekNPipe never blocks, even if the pipe is in blocking mode; if the
pipe cannot be accessed immediately, ERROR_PIPE_BUSY is returned. Because
this function does not block, it returns only what is currently in the pipe.
Thus, if a message pipe is being examined, only a portion of a message may
be returned, even though the specified buffer length could accommodate the
entire message.
<P>
The value returned in<I> pState</I> can be used by the client or the server
to determine the current state of the pipe and to take appropriate action.

<P>
Clients of named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_INBOUND access mode cannot
use the DosPeekNPipe function. If the named pipe's client uses the DosPeekNPipe
function, the function returns error code ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
