<UL> Indicators
describing the characteristics of the memory object that is being suballocated.

<P>
This parameter consists of the following bit fields:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
Bit<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 0<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> DOSSUB_INIT
(0x00000001) This bit must be set to initialize a memory object for suballocation.
Otherwise, the request is to attach a process to a shared memory pool that
was previously initialized by another process using DosSubSetMem.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 1
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>DOSSUB_GROW (0x00000002)
<BR>
If this bit is set, then the request is to increase the size of the memory
pool being managed.  Bit 0 then has no meaning.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> 2
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>DOSSUB_SPARSE_OBJ (0x00000004)
<BR>
Bit 2 is set if the requester wants a suballocation function to manage the
commitment of the pages spanned by the memory pool.
<P>
All of the pages spanned by the object must be initially uncommitted. If
this bit is clear, the suballocation function assumes that all of the pages
spanned by the memory pool are valid and committed.
<P>
For a DosSubSetMem(Grow) request, the setting of this bit should be the
same as when the memory pool was initialized. Otherwise, an error is returned.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>3<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> DOSSUB_SERIALIZE (0x00000008)

<BR>
This bit is set if the requester requires access to the memory pool to be
serialized.
<P>
For shared memory pools, the first DosSubSetMem(Init or Serialize) request
causes the memory pool to be created and opened for the requesting process.

<P>
Subsequent DosSubSetMem(Attach or Serialize) requests cause the shared memory
pool to be attached to the requesting process. The requesting process must
first gain access to the memory object that the pool resides in. DosSubSetMem(Attach)
is indicated when bit 0 is off.
<P>
On a DosSubSetMem(Grow) request, bit 3 should be the same as when the memory
pool was initialized, or an error is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>cb</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D DB C4 91 -->ULONG</A>) - input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
size, in bytes, of the memory pool.
<P>
If the size is not a multiple of 8 bytes, it is rounded down to a multiple
of 8.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
