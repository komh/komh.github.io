<H1>DosExecPgm - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 461 -->
<P>
DosExecPgm allows a program to request that another program execute as a
child process.
<P>
The target program is located and loaded into storage (if necessary), a
process is created for it and placed into execution. The execution of a
child process can be synchronous or asynchronous to the execution of its
parent process. If synchronous execution is indicated, the requesting thread
waits for completion of the child process. Other threads in the requesting
process may continue to run.
<P>
If asynchronous execution is indicated, DosExecPgm places the process ID
of the started child process into the first doubleword of the<I> pRes</I> structure.
If EXEC_ASYNCRESULT is specified for<I> execFlag</I>, the parent process
can issue <A HREF="1940_L2_DosWaitChild.html">DosWaitChild</A> (after DosExecPgm)
to examine the result code returned when the child process ends. If the
value of<I> execFlag</I>, is EXEC_ASYNC, the result code of the asynchronous
child process is not returned to the parent process.
<P>
If synchronous execution is indicated, DosExecPgm places the termination
code and result code into the<I> pRes</I> structure.
<P>
The new process is created with an address space separate and distinct from
its parent; that is, a new linear address space is built for the process.

<P>
The new process inherits all file handles and pipes of its parent, although
not necessarily with the same access rights:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Files are inherited except for those opened with no
inheritance indicated.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pipes are inherited.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A child process inherits file handles obtained by its parent process with
<A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A> calls that indicated inheritance.
The child process also inherits handles to pipes created by the parent process
with <A HREF="265_L2_DosCreatePipe.html">DosCreatePipe</A>. This means that
the parent process has control over the meanings of standard input, output,
and error. For example, the parent could write a series of records to a
file, open the file as standard input, open a listing file as standard output,
and then execute a sort program that takes its input from standard input
and writes to standard output.
<P>
Because a child process can inherit handles, and a parent process controls
the meanings of handles for standard I/O, the parent can duplicate inherited
handles as handles for standard I/O. This permits the parent process and
the child process to coordinate I/O to a pipe or file. For example, a parent
process can create two pipes with <A HREF="265_L2_DosCreatePipe.html">DosCreatePipe
</A>requests. It can issue <A HREF="369_L2_DosDupHandle.html">DosDupHandle
</A>to redefine the read handle of one pipe as standard input (0x0000),
and the write handle of the other pipe as standard output (0x0001). The
child process uses the standard I/O handles, and the parent process uses
the remaining read and write pipe handles. Thus, the child process reads
what the parent process writes to one pipe, and the parent process reads
what the child process writes to the other pipe.
<P>
When an inherited file handle is duplicated, the position of the file pointer
is always the same for both handles, regardless of which handle repositions
the file pointer.
<P>
An asynchronous process that was started because the value of<I> execFlag
</I>was EXEC_TRACE or EXEC_ASYNCRESULTDB is provided a trace flag facility.
This facility and the trace buffers provided by <A HREF="298_L2_DosDebug.html">DosDebug
</A>enable a debugger to perform breakpoint debugging. <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession
</A>provides additional debugging capabilities that allow a debugger to
trace all processes associated with an application running in a child session,
regardless of whether the process is started with DosExecPgm or <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession</A>.

<P>
A detached process is treated as an orphan of the parent process and runs
in the background. Thus, it cannot make any VIO, KBD, or MOU calls, except
from within a video pop-up requested by VioPopUp. To test whether a program
is running detached, use the following method. Issue a video call, (for
example, VioGetAnsi). If the call is not issued within a video pop-up and
the process is detached, the video call returns error code ERROR_VIO_DETACHED.

<P>
You may use DosExecPgm to start a process that is of the same type as the
starting process. Process types include Presentation Manager, text-windowed,
and full-screen. You may not use DosExecPgm to start a process that is of
a different type<!-- entering slot 462 --> than the starting process.
<P>
You must use <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession</A> to
start a new process from a process that is of a different type. For example,
use <A HREF="1812_L2_DosStopSession.html">DosStopSession</A> to start a
Presentation Manager process from a non-Presentation Manager process.
