<P>
DosAllocSharedMem allocates a shared memory object within the virtual-address
space.
<P>
Allocating a shared memory object causes the creation of an object that
describes a region of memory that can be shared. The virtual-address space
in the calling process is allocated and mapped to the shared memory object.

<P>
The virtual-address space for a shared memory object is reserved at the
same location in the virtual address space of every process. This allows
any process to gain access to the shared object at the same virtual address
where it was originally allocated.
<P>
When the shared memory object is given a name, the shared memory object
can be shared by other processes that gain access through the shared memory
name (see <A HREF="643_L2_DosGetNamedSharedMem.html">DosGetNamedSharedMem</A>).

<P>
To specify the name for the shared memory object, the name string provided
must include the prefix "\SHAREMEM\".
<P>
It is an error to request giveable or gettable named shared memory.
<P>
To allocate unnamed shared memory, set the<I> pszName</I> parameter to NULL.

<P>
If the shared memory object is unnamed, it may be specified as giveable
(OBJ_GIVEABLE) or gettable (OBJ_GETTABLE). Unnamed shared memory may be
shared by all processes that get access to the shared memory object (see
<A HREF="666_L2_DosGetSharedMem.html">DosGetSharedMem</A>), or are given
access to the shared memory object (see <A HREF="676_L2_DosGiveSharedMem.html">DosGiveSharedMem</A>).

<P>
It is an error to request non-giveable or non-gettable unnamed shared memory.

<P>
The allocated memory object is rounded up to a multiple of 4KB in size.

<P>
The committed memory allocated by DosAllocSharedMem is movable and can be
swapped.
<P>
With the Intel 80386 processor, execute and read access are equivalent.
Also, write access implies both read and execute access.
<P>
The tiled allocation attribute is provided for compatibility with the existing
16-bit implementation of the operating system. If the shared memory object
is tiled, the virtual address for the shared memory object will be within
the first 512MB of the virtual address space, with 16-bit selectors mapping
the memory object.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> DosAllocMem and DosAllocSharedMem both allocate a block of
memory of the size requested rounded up to the nearest page.  On OS/2 Warp,
the system allocates a 64K object without attributes on every allocation.

<P>
For example, for a DosAllocSharedMem call with a size of 1, the system allocates
a 4096-byte block of committed memory plus 61440 bytes without attributes.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
When you allocate a memory object with the PAG_EXECUTE attribute, it is
implied that this memory object also has the PAG_READ attribute. However,
when querying the attributes of a memory object, you will get the following
results:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, both PAG_EXECUTE and PAG_READ
attributes are returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, only the PAG_EXECUTE attribute is returned.
However, PAG_READ is still implied.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
