<P>
When a process is started, a small block of memory is set aside to be used
as a thread-local memory area. This memory is at the same virtual address
for each thread, but is backed by different physical memory. This permits
each thread to have a small block of memory that is unique, or local, to
that thread.
<P>
The thread-local memory area consists of 32 DWORDs (128 bytes), each DWORD
being 32-bits in size.
