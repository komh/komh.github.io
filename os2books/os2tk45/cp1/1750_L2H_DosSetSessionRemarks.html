<H1>DosSetSession - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1768 -->
<P>
DosSetSession sets or resets one or both of the following parameters related
to a child session:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Selectable or nonselectable. This parameter allows
a parent session to set one of its child sessions as selectable or nonselectable
from the Shell switch list.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bond/no bond. This parameter allows a parent
session to bond one of its child sessions to itself. This means that if
the operator subsequently selects the parent session from the Shell menu
(or double-clicks to the parent session), then the child session will be
brought to the foreground.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The parameters only affect user selections from the Shell switch list or
Shell selections during system hot key processing. They do not affect selections
made by the parent session. Thus, when a parent session selects its own
session, its own session is brought to the foreground, even if a bond is
in effect. When a parent session selects a child session, the child session
is brought to the foreground, even if the parent has previously set the
child nonselectable.
<P>
The above parameters may be set individually. Either can be changed without
affecting the current setting of the other.
<P>
DosSetSession may only be issued by a parent session for a child session.
Neither the parent session itself nor any grandchild, nor any other descendant
session beyond a child session, may be the target of this function. DosSetSession
may only be issued by the process that originally started the specified
session (<I>idSession</I>) through <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession</A>.

<P>
DosSetSession may only be used to change the status of child sessions that
were originally started by the caller with <A HREF="1790_L2_DosStartSession.html">DosStartSession
</A>specifying a value of 1 for<I> Related</I>. That is, DosSetSession may
not be used to change the status of sessions started as independent sessions.

<P>
A bond established between a parent session and a child session can be broken
by reissuing DosSetSession and specifying either:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>BondInd</I> = 2 to break the bond, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>BondInd</I> = 1 to establish a bond with a different
child session. In this case, the bond with the previous child is broken.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If a bond is established between session A and its immediate child session
B, and if another bond is established between session B and its immediate
child session C, then if the operator selects session A, session C is brought
to the foreground. However, if session A selects itself, session A is brought
to the foreground. If session A selects session B, session C is brought
to the foreground. In the latter case, the bond between B and C is honored.

<P>
Assume that a bond is established between session A and its immediate child
session B, and assume that session B is nonselectable. The operator will
not be able to select session B directly. However, if the operator selects
session A, session B will be brought to the foreground.
<P>
A parent session may be running in either the foreground or the background
when DosSetSession is issued.
