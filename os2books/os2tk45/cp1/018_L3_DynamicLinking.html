<P>
Dynamic linking permits several applications to use a single copy of an
executable module.  The executable module is completely separate from the
applications that use it.  Several functions can be built into a DLL, and
applications can use these functions as though they were part of the application's
executable code.  You can change the dynamically-linked functions without
recompiling or relinking the application.
