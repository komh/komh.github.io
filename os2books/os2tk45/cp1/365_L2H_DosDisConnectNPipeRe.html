<H1>DosDisConnectNPipe - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 369 -->
<P>
DosDisConnectNPipe is issued by a server process to acknowledge that a client
process has closed a named pipe. (If a client process tries to issue DosDisConnectNPipe,
ERROR_BAD_PIPE is returned.) The pipe cannot be opened by another client
process until the server process issues this function, followed by DosConnectNPipe.

<P>
Until the client's close has been acknowledged, the server process will
receive a value of zero for<I> pcbActual</I> (indicating end-of-file) if
it tries to read from the pipe, and ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE if it tries to write
to it. Clients that attempt to open the pipe receive ERROR_PIPE_BUSY.
<P>
Any threads that are blocked on the pipe are awakened by DosDisConnectNPipe.
A thread that is blocked on a <A HREF="1994_L2_DosWrite.html">DosWrite</A> request
returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE. A thread that is blocked on a <A HREF="1413_L2_DosRead.html">DosRead
</A>request returns a value of zero for<I> pcbActual</I>.
<P>
If the client end of the pipe is open when DosDisConnectNPipe is issued,
it is forced to close, and the client receives an error code on its next
operation. Note that when a client is forced to close in this manner, data
may be discarded before it has been read by the client.
<P>
DosDisConnectNPipe makes the client's handle invalid, but it does not free
the handle. Therefore, a client that is forced off a pipe by DosDisConnectNPipe
must still issue <A HREF="132_L2_DosClose.html">DosClose</A> to free the
handle resource.
<P>
ERROR_BAD_PIPE is returned if you specify an invalid name or file handle.
