<P>
A successful DosProtectOpen request returns a handle and a 32-bit lockid
for accessing the file. The read/write pointer is set at the first byte
of the file. The position of the pointer can be changed with <A HREF="1003_L2_DosProtectSetFilePtr.html">DosProtectSetFilePtr
</A>or by read and write operations on the file.
<P>
The file's date and time can be queried with <A HREF="939_L2_DosProtectQueryFileI.html">DosProtectQueryFileInfo</A>.
They are set with <A HREF="976_L2_DosProtectSetFileInf.html">DosProtectSetFileInfo</A>.

<P>
The read-only attribute of a file can be set with the ATTRIB command.
<P>
<I>ulAttribute</I> cannot be set to Volume Label. To set volume-label information,
issue <A HREF="976_L2_DosProtectSetFileInf.html">DosProtectSetFileInfo</A> with
a logical drive number.  Volume labels cannot be opened.
<P>
<I>cbFile</I> affects the size of the file only when the file is new or
is a replacement. If an existing file is opened,<I> cbFile</I> is ignored.
To change the size of the existing file, issue <A HREF="1016_L2_DosProtectSetFileSiz.html">DosProtectSetFileSize</A>.

<P>
The value in<I> cbFile</I> is a recommended size. If the full size cannot
be allocated, the open request may still succeed.  The file system makes
a reasonable attempt to allocate the new size in an area that is as nearly
contiguous as possible on the medium. When the file size is extended, the
values of the new bytes are undefined.
<P>
The Direct Open bit provides direct access to an entire disk or diskette
volume, independent of the file system. This mode of opening the volume
that is currently on the drive returns a handle to the calling function;
the handle represents the logical volume as a single file. The calling function
specifies this handle with a <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C5 FC --> DSK_LOCKDRIVE</A> request
to prevent other processes from accessing the logical volume. When you are
finished using the logical volume, issue a <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C5 FC --> DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE</A> request
to allow other processes to access the logical volume.
<P>
The file-handle state bits can be set by DosProtectOpen and <A HREF="965_L2_DosProtectSetFHState.html">DosProtectSetFHState</A>.
An application can query the file-handle state bits, as well as the rest
of the Open Mode field, by issuing <A HREF="928_L2_DosProtectQueryFHSta.html">DosProtectQueryFHState</A>.

<P>
You can use an<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C4 4C --> EAOP2</A> structure
to set extended attributes in<I> peaop2</I> when creating a file, replacing
an existing file, or truncating an existing file. No extended attributes
are set when an existing file is just opened.
<P>
A replacement operation is logically equivalent to atomically deleting and
re-creating the file. This means that any extended attributes associated
with the file also are deleted before the file is re-created.
<P>
The<I> pfhFileHandleLockID</I> returned is required on each of the DosProtectxxxxx
functions. An incorrect<I> pfhFileHandleLockID</I> on subsequent DosProtectxxx
calls results in an ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED return code.
<P>
The DosProtectxxxxx functions can be used with a NULL filehandle lockid,
if the subject filehandle was obtained from <A HREF="754_L2_DosOpen.html">DosOpen</A>.
