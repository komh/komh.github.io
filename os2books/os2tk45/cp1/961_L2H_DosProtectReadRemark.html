<P>
The requested number of bytes might not be read. If the value returned in
<I>pBuffer</I> is zero, the process tried to read from the end of the file.

<P>
A value of zero for<I> cbRead</I> is not considered an error. In such a
case, the system treats the request as a null operation.
<P>
The file pointer is moved to the desired position by reading data, writing
data, or issuing <A HREF="1003_L2_DosProtectSetFilePtr.html">DosProtectSetFilePtr</A>.

<P>
If you issue <A HREF="911_L2_DosProtectOpen.html">DosProtectOpen</A> with
the Direct Open flag set to 1 in the<I> fsOpenMode</I> parameter, you have
direct access to an entire disk or diskette volume, independent of the file
system. You must lock the logical volume before accessing it, and you must
unlock the logical volume when you are finished accessing it. Issue <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C5 FC --> DSK_LOCKDRIVE
</A>to lock the logical volume, and for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C5 FC --> DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE
</A>to unlock the logical volume. While the logical volume is locked, no
other process can access it.
<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
A named pipe is read as one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A byte pipe in byte-read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message pipe in message-read mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message pipe in byte-read mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A byte pipe must be in byte-read mode to be read; an error is returned if
it is in message-read mode. All currently available data, up to the size
requested, is returned.
<P>
A message pipe can be read in either message-read mode or byte-read mode.
When the message pipe is in message-read mode, a read operation that is
larger than the next available message returns only that message.<I> pcbActual
</I>is set to indicate the size of the message returned.
<P>
A read operation that is smaller than the next available message returns
with the number of bytes requested and an ERROR_MORE_DATA return code. When
the reading of a message is resumed after ERROR_MORE_DATA is returned, a
read operation always blocks until the next piece (or the rest) of the message
can be transferred. <A HREF="821_L2_DosPeekNPipe.html">DosPeekNPipe</A> can
be issued to determine how many bytes are left in the message.
<P>
A message pipe in byte-read mode is read as if it were a byte stream, and
DosProtectRead skips over message headers. This is like reading a byte pipe
in byte-read mode.
<P>
When blocking mode is set for a named pipe, a read operation blocks until
data is available. In this case, the read operation never returns with<I> pcbActual
</I>equal to zero, except at the end of the file. When the mode is set to
message-read, messages are always read in their entirety, except when the
message is bigger than the size of the read operation.
<P>
<I>pcbActual</I> can equal zero in nonblocking mode, but only when no data
is available at the time of the read operation.
