<P>
DosSetMem can be used to commit or decommit a range of previously allocated
pages in either a private or shared memory object. It also can be used to
create a sparse population of committed private or shared pages within a
memory object. DosSetMem can also change the access protection applied to
already-committed pages within a memory object.
<P>
Each page in the virtual-address space of the process is either free, private,
or shared.
<P>
The virtual address for free pages is not reserved, not committed, and not
accessible.  An attempt to commit or decommit a free page results in the
return of an error.
<P>
The virtual address for pages in a private or shared memory object is reserved
during the allocation of the memory object. Each page within a memory object
can be in one of two states:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Committed<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> These pages have allocated backing storage,
with access controlled by a protection code. A committed page in a private
memory object may be decommitted; a committed page in a shared memory object
may not be decommitted. An attempt to commit a previously committed page
results in the return of an error.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Decommitted<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> These
pages are not committed and are not accessible. A decommitted page may be
committed if the backing storage is available. An attempt to decommit a
previously decommitted page results in the return of an error.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The commitment of a reserved page in a shared object causes the page to
be committed in the context of each process sharing the shared memory object.

<P>
Any access protection can be applied to committed private pages. Decommitted
pages are given an access protection of "no access".
<P>
When pages are committed, they are backed by demand pages.  The first attempt
to read or write the page causes a page of zeros to be created.
<P>
Decommitting a private page causes the backing storage for the page to be
released.
<P>
Setting the protection on a range of previously committed pages causes the
old access protection to be replaced by the desired access protection. The
access protection can be set only on committed pages.
<P>
Setting the access protection to PAG_GUARD causes a range of guard pages
to be established. If access to this range of pages is attempted, an access
violation (page fault) is generated. This fault sets the protection of the
accessed page to the desired access protection, and generates a condition
that signifies that a guard page has been entered. This capability is intended
to provide automatic stack checking. It can also be used to separate other
data structures when appropriate.
<P>
If a failure occurs, the attributes are not changed on any pages, and an
appropriate error code is returned.
<P>
As each page is considered for protection, its state is determined. If the
state of the page is not committed, or is not being committed, an appropriate
error code is returned. Otherwise, the new protection of the page is set.

<P>
With the Intel 80386 processor, execute and read access are equivalent.
Also, write access implies both read and execute access.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> and <A HREF="065_L2_DosAllocSharedMem.html">DosAllocSharedMem
</A>both allocate a block of memory of the size requested rounded to the
nearest page. On OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 64K object without attributes
on every allocation.
<P>
For example, for a <A HREF="054_L2_DosAllocMem.html">DosAllocMem</A> call
with a size of 1, the following occurs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, the system allocates a 4096-byte
block of committed memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>On
OS/2 Warp, the system allocates a 4096-byte block of committed memory plus
61440 bytes without attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
When you allocate a memory object with the PAG_EXECUTE attribute, it is
implied that this memory object also has the PAG_READ attribute. However,
when querying the attributes of a memory object, you will get the following
results:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp Connect, both PAG_EXECUTE and PAG_READ
attributes are returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2 Warp, only the PAG_EXECUTE attribute is returned.
However, PAG_READ is still implied.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
