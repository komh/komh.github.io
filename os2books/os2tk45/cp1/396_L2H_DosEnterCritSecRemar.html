<H1>DosEnterCritSec - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 400 -->
<P>
DosEnterCritSec causes all other threads in the process to block themselves
and give up their time slice. After a DosEnterCritSec request is made, no
functions should be called that depend on another thread to do processing
until <A HREF="470_L2_DosExitCritSec.html">DosExitCritSec</A> has completed.
 Great care should be taken when using compiler runtime functions and other
OS/2 functions after a DosEnterCritSec request has been made, since the
underlying processing of the called function may require processing by another
thread and thus cause a deadlock.
<P>
A thread can also execute code without having to give up time slices to
other threads in its process if it requests a priority class that is higher
than those of the other threads. A thread's priority is examined with <A HREF="618_L2_DosGetInfoBlocks.html">DosGetInfoBlocks</A>,
and changed with <A HREF="1713_L2_DosSetPriority.html">DosSetPriority</A>.

<P>
A count is maintained of the number of times DosEnterCritSec is issued without
a corresponding <A HREF="470_L2_DosExitCritSec.html">DosExitCritSec</A>.
The count is incremented by DosEnterCritSec and decremented by <A HREF="470_L2_DosExitCritSec.html">DosExitCritSec</A>.
Normal thread dispatching is not restored until the count is zero. The outstanding
DosEnterCritSec count is maintained in a word. If an overflow occurs, the
count is set to the maximum value, no operation is performed, and the request
returns with ERROR_CRITSEC_OVERFLOW.
<P>
If a signal occurs, thread 1 begins execution to process the signal even
though another thread in the process has a DosEnterCritSec active. Thread
1 of a process is its initial thread of execution, not a thread created
with <A HREF="285_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread</A>. Any processing
done by thread 1 to satisfy the signal must not include accessing the critical
resource intended to be protected by DosEnterCritSec.
<P>
<B>Note: </B><B> This function is very powerful and must be used with caution!
</B>It should be used only in a most cooperative environment where the state
of all threads in known.  While in the critical section, do not call other
compiler runtime or OS/2 functions that could start another thread that
it would depend on running before being able to return.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<A HREF="1384_L2_DosQueryThreadContex.html">DosQueryThreadContext</A> can
be used to obtain the context of other threads in the process once they
have been blocked by DosEnterCritSec.
<P>
ERROR_INVALID_THREADID is returned when an invalid attempt is made to enter
a critical section of code in a signal handler or exception handler.
<P>
ERROR_INVALID_THREADID is also returned when a dynamic link library (DLL)
routine incorrectly issues DosEnterCritSec.
