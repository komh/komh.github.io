<H1>DosSetPathInfo - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1727 -->
<P>
To use DosSetPathInfo to set any level of file information for a file or
subdirectory, a process must have exclusive write access to the closed file
object. Thus, if the file object is already accessed by another process,
any call to DosSetPathInfo will fail.
<P>
A value of 0 in the date and time components of a field causes that field
to be left unchanged. For example, if both "last write date" and "last write
time" are specified as 0 in the Level 1 information structure, then both
attributes of the file are left unchanged. If either "last write date" or
"last write time" are other than 0, then both attributes of the file are
set to the new values.
<P>
For data integrity purposes, the Write-Through bit in<I> flOptions</I> should
be used only to write the extended attributes to the disk immediately, instead
of caching them and writing them later. Having the Write-Through bit set
constantly can degrade performance.
<P>
In the FAT file system, only the dates and times of the last write can be
modified. Creation and last-access dates and times are not affected.
<P>
The last-modification date and time will be changed if the extended attributes
are modified.
