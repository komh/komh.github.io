<H1>DosAllocThreadLocalMemory - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
When a process is started, a small block of memory is set aside to be used
as a thread-local memory area. This memory is at the same virtual address
for each thread, but is backed by different physical memory. This permits
each thread to have a small block of memory that is unique, or local, to
that thread.
<P>
The thread-local memory area consists of 32 DWORDs (128 bytes), each DWORD
being 4 bytes in size. Up to 8 DWORDs (32 bytes) can be requested each time
this function is called. If you want to allocate more than 8 DWORDs, you
must call this function more than once.
<P>
Allocation is by DWORD only. If you want to store a BYTE in the thread-local
memory area, you would still allocate a DWORD, then store the BYTE in it.
