<P>
Multitasking is the ability of the operating system to manage the execution
of more than one application at a time. For the programmer, this includes
the ability to multitask your own programs.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system supports two forms of multitasking for programs.
An application can start other programs that will execute concurrently with
the application. These programs can be a new copy of the application, a
related program that is designed to work with the application, or an unrelated
program. The operating system provides functions to communicate with and
control the programs started by the application.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system also enables applications to run multiple threads
of execution within the same application;  separate activities can be multitasked
within the application. An example of this is dispatching a separate subroutine
to load a file and having the subroutine execute at the same time the main
routine continues to monitor and respond to user input.
