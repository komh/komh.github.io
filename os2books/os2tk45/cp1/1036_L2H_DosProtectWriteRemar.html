<H1>DosProtectWrite - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1052 -->
<P>
DosProtectWrite begins to write at the current file-pointer position. The
file pointer is automatically moved by read and write operations. It can
be moved to a desired position by issuing <A HREF="1003_L2_DosProtectSetFilePtr.html">DosProtectSetFilePtr</A>.

<P>
If the specified file has been opened using the write-through flag, DosProtectWrite
writes the data to the disk before returning. Upon return to the caller,
<I>pcbActual</I> contains the number of bytes actually written.
<P>
If there is not enough space on the disk or diskette to write all of the
bytes specified by<I> cbWrite</I> then DosProtectWrite does not write any
bytes. Upon return to the caller,<I> pcbActual</I> contains zero.
<P>
A value of zero for<I> cbWrite</I> is not considered an error. No data transfer
occurs, and there is no effect on the file or the file pointer.
<P>
If the file is read-only, the write operation to the file is not performed.

<P>
If you issue <A HREF="911_L2_DosProtectOpen.html">DosProtectOpen</A> with
the Direct Open flag set to 1 in the<I> fsOpenMode</I> parameter, you have
direct access to an entire disk or diskette volume, independent of the file
system. You must lock the logical volume before accessing it, and you must
unlock the logical volume when you are finished accessing it. Issue <A HREF="343_L2_DosDevIOCtl.html">DosDevIOCtl
</A>for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B7 C5 FC --> DSK_LOCKDRIVE
</A>to lock the logical volume, and for Category 8,<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C5 FC --> DSK_UNLOCKDRIVE
</A>to unlock the logical volume. While the logical volume is locked, no
other process can access it.
<P>
<B>Named-Pipe Considerations</B>
<P>
DosProtectWrite also is used to write bytes or messages to a named pipe.

<P>
Each write operation to a message pipe writes a message whose size is the
length of the write operation. DosProtectWrite automatically encodes message
lengths in the pipe, so applications need not encode this information in
the buffer being written.
<P>
Write operations in blocking mode always write all requested bytes before
returning.
<P>
In nonblocking mode, DosProtectWrite returns either with all bytes written
or none written. DosProtectWrite returns with no bytes written when it would
have to divide the message into blocks in order to complete the request.
This can occur when there is not enough space left in the pipe, or when
the pipe is currently being written to by another client. If this occurs,
DosProtectWrite returns immediately with a value of zero for<I> pcbActual
</I>indicating that no bytes were written.
<P>
For a byte pipe, if the number of bytes to be written exceeds the space
available in the pipe, DosProtectWrite writes as many bytes as it can, and
returns with the number of bytes actually written in<I> pcbActual</I>.
<P>
An attempt to write to a pipe whose other end has been closed returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.
