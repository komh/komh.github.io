<P>
DosExit is issued when a thread completes executing. The current thread
or process ends.
<P>
DosExit allows a thread to terminate itself or be terminated by another
thread in its process. If<I> action</I> is 0 and the specified thread is
the last thread executing in the process, the process ends. If<I> action
</I>is 1, the process ends.
<P>
The system can start threads on behalf of an application. Thus, if the intent
of DosExit is to terminate the process, a value of 1 should be specified
for<I> action</I> to end all the threads belonging to the process.
<P>
Do not end thread 1 without ending the process. Thread 1 is the initial
thread of execution, not a thread started by a <A HREF="285_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
</A>request. When thread 1 ends, any monitors or signal processing routines
set for this process also end. To avoid unpredictable results, DosExit should
be issued with a value of 1 for<I> action</I> to ensure that the process
ends.
<P>
When a process is ending, all but one thread is ended, and that thread executes
routines whose addresses have been specified with <A HREF="478_L2_DosExitList.html">DosExitList</A>.
After resources have been released by the exit list routines, this thread
and all other resources owned by the process are released.
