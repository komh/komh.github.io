<H1>DosExitList - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 490 -->
<P>
DosExitList is issued to define a routine that is to be given control when
a process completes its execution. Multiple routines may be defined to receive
control when a process is ending. For each process, the operating system
maintains a list of addresses of defined exit list routines.
<P>
When the process is ending, the operating system transfers control to each
address in this list. If there are multiple addresses in the list, they
will each get control in numerical order by function invocation order, that
is, low (0) will be first, and high (0xFF) will be last. In case of duplicate
entries for the same value, the routines will be run in LIFO (last in, first
out) order.
<P>
Library modules can issue DosExitList to free resources or to clear flags
and semaphores in case the client process ends without notifying them.
<P>
Before transferring control to the routines in the termination list, the
operating system resets the stack to its initial value. The routine must
be in the address space of the ending process. The termination routine should
perform its processing and then issue DosExitList with a value of 3 (EXLST_EXIT)
for<I> ordercode</I>. The termination routine should be as short as possible.

<P>
Most system functions are allowed in an exit list routine. However, <A HREF="285_L2_DosCreateThread.html">DosCreateThread
</A>and <A HREF="445_L2_DosExecPgm.html">DosExecPgm</A> are not.
<P>
An exit list routine must not call functions that have a better function
order priority (that is, a lower value for<I> ordercode</I>) than itself.
For example, an exit list routine with a function order value of 0x9A can
use Presentation Services functions but not Communications Manager functions.

<P>
When the exit list routine receives control, the first parameter on the
stack (located at ESP+4) contains a termination code that describes why
the process ended. The values of the termination codes are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TC_EXIT
<BR>
Normal exit<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TC_HARDERROR
<BR>
Hard-error halt<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TC_TRAP
<BR>
Trap operation for a 16-bit child process<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TC_KILLPROCESS
<BR>
Unintercepted <A HREF="702_L2_DosKillProcess.html">DosKillProcess</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TC_EXCEPTION
<BR>
Exception operation for a 32-bit child process<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
When the exit list routine receives control, all system semaphores owned
by the process have their ownership transferred to the thread that performs
exit list processing. This allows the thread to request serialization semaphores
without danger of blocking in case the semaphore was held by another thread
in the process that has already ended.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> All exit list routines<I> must</I> be declared as VOID APIENTRY.
This ensures the integrity of the stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
