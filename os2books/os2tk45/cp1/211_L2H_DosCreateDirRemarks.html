<P>
DosCreateDir enables an application to define extended attributes for a
subdirectory at the time of its creation.
<P>
If any subdirectory names specified in the path name do not exist, the subdirectory
is not created. Upon successful return, a subdirectory is created at the
end of the specified path.
<P>
An application must issue <A HREF="1372_L2_DosQuerySysInfo.html">DosQuerySysInfo
</A>to determine the maximum path length that the operating system supports.
The returned value should be used to dynamically allocate buffers that are
to be used to store paths.
<P>
If a program with its NEWFILES bit set tries to create a directory on an
FAT file system drive and specifies blanks immediately preceding the dot
in a file name, the system rejects the name. For example, if c: is an FAT
file system drive, the name "file .txt" is rejected, but "file.txt" is accepted.
