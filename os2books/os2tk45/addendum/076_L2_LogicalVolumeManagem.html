<B>Purpose</B> 
<P>
 This IOCtl may be used with any logical volume to which a drive letter
has been assigned. This function will be used by FORMAT and will also be
of use to those writing disk utilities for OS/2.

The Identify Volume Type command provides a way to determine whether a volume
is a Compatibility or LVM Volume.
<P>
The Enable Bad Block Relocation command enables bad block relocation on
the specified volume if that volume supports it.
<P>
The Disable Bad Block Relocation command disables bad block relocation on
the specified volume.
<P>
Get Bad Block Information returns the total number of bad block relocations
which are currently in effect for the specified volume, as well as the number
of relocation tables being used to perform bad block relocation for the
specified volume.  There is one bad block relocation table per physical
disk partition, so, for LVM volumes employing drive linking, there may be
several such tables.
<P>
Get Table Size returns the number of active entries in the specified bad
block relocation table, as well as the maximum number of entries that the
table can hold.  The size of a bad block relocation table is dependent upon
the size of the partition it is supporting.  Larger partitions have larger
relocation tables, while smaller partitions have smaller relocation tables.

<P>
Get Relocated Sector List returns an array of Logical Sector Numbers (LSN).
 Each LSN in the array is a sector whose data had to be relocated because
of a problem writing to that sector.  The array returned is specific to
a Relocation Table.  The user supplied buffer must be large enough to hold
the entire array.  The size of the array can be determined by using the
Get Table Size command to find the number of active entries in the table,
and then multiplying that value by the size of a Logical Sector Number (currently,
4 bytes).
<P>
Get Relocated Data returns the data associated with a sector that appears
in a relocation table for the specified volume.  The user supplied buffer
must be at least 512 bytes in length, because 512 bytes are returned.
<P>
Remove Relocation Table Entry removes the specified LSN from the relocation
tables on the specified volume.  This function is typically used by utilities
which adjust the file system on a volume so that all LSNs requiring relocation
are removed from use.  Since the file system will never use these LSNs again,
they can be safely removed from the relocation tables for the volume, thereby
freeing those entries to be used again.
<P>
Clear Relocation Table is used to remove all of the entries in a relocation
table in a single operation.  This function is intended to be used by FORMAT
immediately before a long format is performed.  Typically, FORMAT will disable
bad block relocation and clear the bad block relocation tables prior to
a long format so that all bad sectors may be detected by FORMAT.  FORMAT
will place any bad sectors detected into the bad block list for the appropriate
file system.
<P>
Get Drive Name is used to return the user defined name associated with the
physical drive on which the specified relocation table resides.  This function
can be used to identify which physical drive contains a specific relocation
table associated with a volume.  The name returned will not exceed 20 characters.

</UL>Drive Unit<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> Drive Unit is
used only when the IOCtl is issued without using a previously allocated
file<!-- entering slot 118 --> handle. In this case, the IOCtl must be issued
with a file handle of  1. Drive Unit values are 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, etc.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Table Number is the number of the relocation

<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
