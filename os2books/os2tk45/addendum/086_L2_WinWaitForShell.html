</UL>
<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
ulEvent (ULONG)  input<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> ulEvent has the following
flags which indicate which event is to be queried. One, and only one, of
these flags must be turned on.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
WWFS_DESKTOPCREATED<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Desktop has been created.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> WWFS_DESKTOPOPENED
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>A view of the Desktop has been opened.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> WWFS_DESKTOPPOPULATED
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The desktop has been populated..<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> WWFS_QUERY
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Query if the event has taken place. If this flag
is not turned on then this call will block until the event has taken place.
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Returns</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
rc (BOOL)  returns<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Success indicator.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
True<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Event has taken place<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> False
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Event has not taken place<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Possible
returns from WinGetLastError <!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
PMERR_INVALID_PARAMETER (0x1208)<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> One of the defined
WWFS_DESKTOP* flags was not passed in ulEvent.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
This function can be used to either determine if a Workpalce Shell event
has taken place or wait until that event has taken place. Set ulEvent to
one of the WWFS_DESKTOP* #defines above.
<P>
To block until the event has occurred, do not turn on the WWFS_QUERY flag.

<P>
 Simply to query if the event has occurred and not to wait for it to occur,
turn on the WWFS_QUERY flag.
<P>
<B>Example Code</B>
<P>
This example checks (non-blocking) to see if the Workplalce Shell Desktop
to be populated has been populated or not.
<PRE>#define#include  os2.h&gt;

BOOL fOccurred;

fOccurred + WinWaitForShell(WWFS_DESKTOPPOPULATED | WWFS_QUERY);
if (fOccurred)
   {
    /* The Desktop has been populated */
   }
else
   {
    /* The Desktop has not been populated */
