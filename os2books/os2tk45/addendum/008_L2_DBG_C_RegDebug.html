<P>
<B> Debug Command 35 JIT (Just-in-Time) Debugger Registration/De-Registration
Command</B>
<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> Process of ID of debuggee<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Cmd
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>DBG_C_RegDbg<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Buffer<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> Pointer
to JIT Debugger path name and arguments
<P>
Address of the buffer in which the fully-qualified path name of the JIT
debugger is specified.  The path name can be followed by an optional arguments
to the JIT debugger.  If %d is found in the arguments, the system will replace
%d with the ID of the failing process.  If %d is not found in the arguments,
the system will assume argument one is the process ID.
<P>
A coded example of this follows 
<P>
Assume the ID of the failing process is 99.
<P>
If Buffer contains "C \OS2\MYJITDBG.EXE /Tn /K /P%d",  the system will launch
the JIT debugger as "C \OS2\MYJITDBG.EXE /Tn /K /P99"
<P>
If Buffer contains "C \OS2\MYJITDBG.EXE /Tn /K",  the system will launch
the JIT debugger as "C \OS2\MYJITDBG.EXE 99 /Tn /K"<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Len
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>0 or the size of Buffer in bytes
<P>
A Len of 0 is used to deregister the JIT debugger from the given process.
Buffer is ignored in this case. If Len is 0 and no JIT debugger is registered
the system will return error code ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Addr
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>Registration Flags<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
JIT_REG_INHERIT<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Enable children processes to inherit
registered per-process JIT debugger from parent. (This is the default.)
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL>JIT_REG_NONINHERIT<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Do not
allow inheritance of per-process JIT debugger to the children of that parent
process.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL> If Inheritance is being used with DosStartSession()
on a PM application, the inheritance link is broken. This is due to the
design of sessions management for DosStartSession() which causes all children
processes to always inherit from the PM. The recommended way to start a
child process is through DosExecPgm() under the same session type. The parent-child
relationship will be set up correctly and the JIT will be inherited. Otherwise
the parent application has to register the JIT on every DosStartSession()
child process. The JIT could also be registered on the main PMSHELL.EXE
process. This would cause all future DosStartSession() processes to inherit
the JIT information from PM. This works around the DosStartSession() inheritance
problem above.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The only DosDebug notifications that are returned by this command are DBG_N_Success

<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
This is one of the only DosDebug commands that can be called without having
to issue a DBG_C_Connect or DBG_C_Attach first. This command is usually
called after starting a process using DosExecPgm() or DosStartSession()
in order to gather the PID to use with the registration command. Another
way of gathering PID information is to use the DosQuerySysState(). This
will return all of the current Process ID's running in the system. See DosQuerySysState()
for more information. The registration of the debugger must use a fully-qualified
path name and executable for per-process and global registration.  Registration
will not occur if the debugger is not physically found on the disk upon
registration.  If you make multiple calls to DosDebug with the DBG_C_RegDbg
command, the previous debugger will be deleted and the newest one will be
registered. If the DBG_C_RegDbg is called with the size field of 0 and a
JIT debugger exists, the JIT debugger will be unregistered. This only applies
for per-process JIT registration. Global registration cannot be unregistered.
This is set for a systemwide level.
<P>
If a per-process JIT registration exists, it will be used over the global
JIT registration specified in the CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
The JIT debugger is<!-- entering slot 10 --> invoked when an application
process encounters a trap or exception not serviced by that application's
exception management.  Under normal operations, where a JIT debugger has
not been registered with the OS, the application would be terminated by
the user on a Hard Error Popup. This disallowed state information from being
gathered.  By registering a JIT debugger with the OS, the OS will launch
the JIT debugger in place of the Hard Error popup.
<P>
The JIT debugger should attach to the dying process allowing the user to
debug the dying process using a conventional debug program or just gather
state debugger (unattended).  A state debugger would gather required information
to determine the state of the process dying; e.g., stack, registers, addresses,
storage, etc.  Once the state is gathered, the state debugger could save
it to a log and terminate the offending process and/or start a new process
in place of the old. This is completely customizable in the JIT debugger.

<P>
There are two types of JIT registration supported in OS/2.  The first type
is global registration.  This allows the user to register a global debugger
for the entire OS in the CONFIG.SYS.  This debugger will be launched for
any process in the OS that has an error.  The global debugger will not support
launching a PM (Presentation Manager(R)) JIT debugger.  This has to be a
VIO application (or one that produces no screen output) because of the organization
of the boot cycle at which a JIT debugger can be invoked.  The global JIT
registration is done before the loading of device drivers, IFS, CALLS, and
RUNS.  This enables JIT support for all of these types of files.
<P>
The syntax for the CONFIG.SYS is as follows 
<P>
JITDBGREG=[JIT_PathName] [arguments]
<P>
Refer to Buffer under parameters section above to see how [JIT_PathName]
and [arguments] are used.
<P>
Example 
<P>
JITDBGREG=c \os2\MYJITDBG.EXE /Tn /K /PID%d
<P>
The second type of JIT registration is the per-process registration. This
type of registration allows the user to register any type of debugger including
PM and VIO using the DBG_C_RegDbg command above.
<P>
<B>Attention</B>  The JIT debugger writer needs to be aware of the environment
that the JIT is being used in because of PM and VIO considerations for starting
the debugger in regards session management and screen groups.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For kernel debugger users there is an option to turn off the
JIT debugger support when trying to catch traps in the kernel debugger.
See the .on, .of and .oq switches in the kernel debugger help.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
