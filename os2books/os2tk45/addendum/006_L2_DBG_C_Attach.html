<P>
This must be the first DosDebug command called when dynamically attaching
to a process. No other DosDebug command will be accepted until the debugging
connection has been established except for DBG_C_RegDebug to register a
JIT (Just-in-time) debugger on a per-process basis and DBG_C_QueryDebug
to query the JIT debug information. See DBG_C_RegDebug and DBG_C_QueryDebug
for more information.
<P>
<B>Returns</B>
<P>
This command establishes a debugging connection. It must be the initial
command, since it verifies the buffer format for the rest of the connection.

<P>
Because DosDebug usually cannot be ported to new machines without changing
the format of the buffer, this command is needed to establish that the debugger
is capable of handling the desired buffer format.
<P>
If the requested debugging level is not supported, an error is returned,
and the connection is not made. This gives the debugger a chance to try
again or to start automatically a different debugger process that uses a
different buffer format.
<P>
For this command, the machine-independent and PID portion of the buffer
is examined. This portion includes the Pid, Tid, Cmd, and Value fields.
This makes it possible to port the DosDebug buffer from one machine to another
without returning an error to the debugger on the initial DosDebug command.

<P>
The only DosDebug notifications that are returned by this command are DBG_N_Success
and DBG_N_Error.
<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
This DBG_C_Attach command does not require that the session for the program
being debugged tohave been started with EXEC_TRACE, or SSF_TRACEOPT_XXX
option by DosExecPgm or DosStartSession, as DBG_C_Connect requires.
<P>
If a connection to the program being debugged is established by a debugger,
then another debug session cannot attach to the program being debugged while
the first debugger is attached.
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
If<I> Addr</I> is not 0, the connection between the debugger and the program
being debugged is not severed. If any threads of the program being debugged,
other than the thread that encountered the debug event, are holding system
semaphores, they will be allowed to run until they release the semaphores.
They will then be stopped, and the notification will be delivered.
<P>
If the thread encountering the debug event is holding a system semaphore,
the connection between the debugger and the program being debugged is severed
by terminating the program being debugged and returning a DBG_N_Error notification
to the debugger with the value field set to 0 and the register set filled
in. No further DosDebug commands will be accepted by the program being debugged,
nor will it generate any other notifications.
<P>
If a DBG_C_Stop is issued, and a thread owning a system semaphore is about
to generate a DBG_N_AsyncStop notification, it will be allowed to continue
execution until it releases the semaphore. It will then be stopped, and
the notification will be delivered. This is the only exception to the severing
of the debugger/debugbee rule.
<P>
If<I> Addr</I> is set to 0, the connection between the debugger and the
program being debugged is severed if a system resource is being held, in
which case DosDebug returns <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Tid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> Thread owning semaphore<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Cmd
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>DBG_N_Error<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Value<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> ERROR_EXCL_SEM_ALREADY_OWNED
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the debugger needs to present some information to the user or use the
thread holding the system resource, the debugger must terminate the program
being debugged. Any other action might<!-- entering slot 7 --> result in
a system halt.
<P>
Upon attach to a process, a series of notifications will occur. The notifications
include the current EXE module notification, thread (all that exist in the
debuggee) create notifications, and currently loaded modules (DLLs) notifications.
The notifications occur as DBG_NPModuleLoad, DBG_N_ThreadCreate, etc, just
as they do with the DBG_C_Connect command.
