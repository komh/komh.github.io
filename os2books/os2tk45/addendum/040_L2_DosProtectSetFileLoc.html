<UL> Atomic
<P>
This bit defines a request for atomic locking. If this bit is set to 1 and
the lock range is equal to the unlock range, an atomic lock occurs. If this
bit is set to 1 and the lock range is not equal to the unlock range, an
error is returned.

If this bit is set to 0, then the lock may or may not occur atomically with
the unlock.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

<UL> Share
<P>
This bit defines the type of access that other processes may have to the
file range that is being locked.
<P>
If this bit is set to 0 (the default), other processes have no access to
the locked file range. The current process has exclusive access to the locked
file range, which must not overlap any other locked file range.
<P>
If this bit is set to 1, the current process and other processes have shared
read only access to the locked file range. A file range with shared access
may overlap any other file range with shared access, but must not overlap
any other file range with exclusive access.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
DosProtectSetFileLocksL allows a process to lock and unlock a range in a
file. The time during which a file range is locked should be short.
<P>
If the lock and unlock ranges are both zero, ERROR_LOCK_VIOLATION is returned
to the caller.
<P>
If you only want to lock a file range, set the unlock file offset and the
unlock range length to zero.
<P>
If you only want to unlock a file range, set the lock file offset and the
lock range length to zero.
<P>
When the Atomic bit of<I> flags</I> is set to 0, and DosProtectSetFileLocksL
specifies a lock operation and an unlock operation, the unlock operation
occurs first, and then the lock operation is performed. If an error occurs
during the unlock operation, an error code is returned and the lock operation
is not performed. If an error occurs during the lock operation, an error
code is returned and the unlock remains in effect if it was successful.

<P>
The lock operation is atomic when all of these conditions are met <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Atomic bit is set to 1 in<I> flags</I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The unlock range is the same as the lock range<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The process has shared access to the file range, and
has requested exclusive access to it; or the process has exclusive access
to the file range, and has requested shared access to it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some file system drivers (FSDs) may not support atomic lock operations.
Versions of the operating system prior to OS/2 Version 2.00 do not support
atomic lock operations. If the application receives the error code ERROR_ATOMIC_LOCK_NOT_SUPPORTED,
the application should unlock the file range and then lock it using a non-atomic
operation (with the atomic bit set to 0 in<I> flags</I>). The application
should also refresh its internal buffers before making any changes to the
file.
<P>
If you issue DosProtectClose to close a file with locks still in effect,
the locks are released in no defined sequence.
<P>
If you end a process with a file open, and you have locks in effect in that
file, the file is closed and the locks are released in no defined sequence.

<P>
The locked range can be anywhere in the logical file. Locking beyond the
end of the file is not an error. A file range to be locked exclusively must
first be cleared of any locked file sub-ranges or overlapping locked file
ranges.
<P>
If you repeat DosProtectSetFileLocksL for the same file handle and file
range, then you duplicate access to the file range. Access to locked file
ranges is not<!-- entering slot 67 --> duplicated across DosExecPgm. The
proper method of using locks is to attempt to lock the file range, and to
examine the return value.
<P>
The following table shows the level of access granted when the accessed
file range is locked with an exclusive lock or a shared lock.  Owner  refers
to a process that owns the lock.  Non-owner  refers to a process that does
not own the lock.
<PRE> Action       Exclusive Lock             Shared Lock

 Owner read   Success                    Success

 Non-owner    Wait for unlock. Return    Success
 read         error code after time-out.

 Owner write  Success                    Wait for unlock. Return
                                         error code after time-out.

 Non-owner    Wait for unlock. Return    Wait for unlock. Return
 write        error code after time-out. error code after time-out.

</PRE>

<P>
If only locking is specified, DosProtectSetFileLocksL locks the specified
file range using<I> pflLock</I> If the lock operation cannot be accomplished,
an error is returned, and the file range is not locked.
<P>
After the lock request is processed, a file range can be unlocked using
the<I> pflUnlock</I> parameter of another DosProtectSetFileLocksL request.
If unlocking cannot be accomplished, an error is returned.
<P>
Instead of denying read/write access to an entire file by specifying access
and sharing modes with DosProtectOpenL requests, a process attempts to lock
only the range needed for read/write access and examines the error code
returned.
<P>
Once a specified file range is locked exclusively, read and write access
by another process is denied until the file range is unlocked. If both unlocking
and locking are specified by DosProtectSetFileLocksL, the unlocking operation
is performed first, then locking is done.
