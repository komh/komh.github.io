<P>
The window procedure is expected to highlight or unhighlight the selected
item of the window, as appropriate.
<P>
This message is sent to a window when it loses the focus to another window
that it does not own. It allows an application to remove the selection when
the focus is removed to another application, but to keep it if, for example,
the same application displays a dialog box.
