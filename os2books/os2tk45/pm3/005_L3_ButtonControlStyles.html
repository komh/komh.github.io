</UL> BS_AUTOSIZE
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->

<P>
If BS_AUTOSIZE is selected when the button is created, and a -1 is specified
for either the parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 FC --> WinCreateWindow</A>,

device or pressing the keyboard spacebar when it is active,<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_DEFAULT
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A BS_DEFAULT pushbutton is one with a thick border
box. It has the same properties as a pushbutton. In addition, the user may
press a BS_DEFAULT pushbutton by pressing the RETURN or ENTER key. The intention
is the same for user-buttons, but the appearance of a BS_DEFAULT userbutton
is application defined.
<P>
This style can be ORed with the BS_PUSHBUTTON and BS_USERBUTTON styles:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>BS_HELP<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The button posts

</A>message.
<P>

icons) to be placed on the push button control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_NOBORDER
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>The pushbutton is displayed without a border drawn

<P>
This style can be ORed with the BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON style.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Buttons with this style do not set the focus to
themselves when clicked with the pointing device. This enables the cursor
to stay on a control for which information is required, rather than moving
to the button. This style has no effect on keyboard interaction. The tab
key can still be used as usual to move the focus to the button.
<P>
This style can be ORed with any of the basic button styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_NOTEBOOKBUTTON
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A notebook button is identical to a pushbutton except
that when it is created as a child of a notebook page it becomes a button
in the common button area of the notebook page.  If the button is not in
a notebook page it will be indistinguishable from a pushbutton.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_PUSHBUTTON
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A pushbutton is a box that contains a string. When
a button is pushed, by clicking the pointing device on it or pressing the
spacebar when it is active, the parent window is notified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_RADIOBUTTON
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A radio button is similar to a check box, but is
typically used in groups in which only one button at a time is checked.
When a radio button is clicked or a cursor key is pressed to move within
the group, it notifies its owner window. It is then up to the owner window
to check the clicked radio button and uncheck all the rest, if necessary.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>BS_SYSCOMMAND<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The button
posts a <A HREF="4925_L3_WM_SYSCOMMAND.html">WM_SYSCOMMAND</A> message rather

<P>
This style can be ORed with the BS_PUSHBUTTON style.
<P>
If both BS_HELP and BS_SYSCOMMAND are set, BS_HELP takes<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_TEXT
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>This enables both text and a bitmap, icon, or miniicon
to be placed on the push button control. This style works only with the
BS_PUSHBUTTON style, and should be used in conjunction with BS_BITMAP, BS_ICON
or BS_MINIICON.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_USERBUTTON<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> This
is an application-definable button. The owner window of this style control
receives the additional button style BN_PAINT.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BS_3STATE
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A three-state check box is identical to a check
box control except that its check box can be half-toned as well as the box
being checked or unchecked.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When BS_ICON, BS_MINIICON or BS_BITMAP is selected, the image can be activated
by specifying the image ID with the button text string.<!-- entering slot 7 --> For
instance, to load an icon (#define ICON_ID 300), and display it within a
button, the button string is set to "#300."
<P>
When BS_ICON, BS_MINIICON or BS_BITMAP is selected along with BS_TEXT, the
image can still be activated by specifying the following with a zero-terminated
text string. format:
<PRE>"#&lt;image-id&gt;\t&lt;text&gt;"

</PRE>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
&lt;image-id&gt;<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>resource id of the icon, miniicon
or bitmap<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>\t<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>tab character<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>&lt;text&gt;<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>zero-terminated button text string
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example, to load an icon (#define ICON_ID 300) and display it with the
button text "My Button," the button string is set to "#300\tMy Button."
Notice the "\t" is used to separate the text from the image-id. The image
is displayed above the text within the button.
