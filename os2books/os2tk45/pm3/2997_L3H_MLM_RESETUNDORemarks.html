<P>
This message resets the undo state of the MLE to indicate that the last
operation cannot be undone (null return from <A HREF="2973_L3_MLM_QUERYUNDO.html">MLM_QUERYUNDO</A>).
This can be used by the application when it performs an operation that it
can undo, that supersedes the last MLE operation.  The application can then
reset its own undo state upon receipt of an MLN_CHANGE, indicating that
later changes have occurred through the MLE.
