<UL> A key stroke causes the amount
of text to exceed the limit on the number of bytes of data (refer to <A HREF="3102_L3_MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT.html">MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT</A>).
 The parameter contains the number of bytes of data which would not fit
within the current text limit.  For character key strokes this can be 1
or 2 (DBCS).  For Shift+Ins (paste) it can be any amount up to the paste
limit.
<P>
The default<I> rc</I> of FALSE causes the default error handling, which
is to ignore the key stroke, and beep.
<P>
An<I> rc</I> of TRUE implies that corrective action has been taken (such
as deleting existing text or raising the limit) and the <A HREF="3147_L3_WM_CHARinMultilineEn.html">WM_CHAR

<UL> A key
stroke causes the size of the display bit map to exceed the horizontal limit
of the format rectangle (refer to <A HREF="3047_L3_MLM_SETFORMATRECT.html">MLM_SETFORMATRECT</A>).
The parameter contains the number of pels that would not fit within the
current text limit.
<P>
The default<I> rc</I> of FALSE causes the default error handling, which
is to ignore the key stroke, and beep.
<P>
An<I> rc</I> of TRUE implies that corrective action has been taken (such
as changing to a smaller font or raising the limit) and the <A HREF="3147_L3_WM_CHARinMultilineEn.html">WM_CHAR
(in Multiline Entry Fields)</A> should be reprocessed as if just entered.

to contain the text or the text exceeds the limit.

</UL> MLN_UNDOOVERFLOW
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Signals that the text change operation, which could

exceeds the undo capability. This includes text entry, deletion, cutting,
and pasting.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL> Sent
whenever the MLE window loses the input focus.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MLN_MARGIN
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Whenever the user moves the mouse into the left,
right top, or bottom margins, this message is sent to the owner of the window.

<P>
If the owner returns an<I> rc</I> of TRUE, the mouse move is assumed to
have been processed by the owner and no further action need be taken.
<P>
If the owner returns an<I> rc</I> of FALSE, the MLE performs a default action
appropriate to each different mouse action.
<P>
The exceptions to this are all mouse messages that occur after a button-down
inside the margin, until and including the matching button-up.  Conceptually
the drag (button-down until button-up) is a single macro event.  Therefore,
if FALSE is returned for a button-down event, no further margin notifications
are given until after the drag has ended (button-up).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the application receives a notification of button-down
in the margin and processes it, it must<!-- entering slot 2689 --> capture
the mouse until the button-up event.<!-- lm: 0x2 12 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MLN_SEARCHPAUSE
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>This notification is sent periodically by the MLE,
while an <A HREF="3000_L3_MLM_SEARCH.html">MLM_SEARCH</A> message is being
processed, to give an application the opportunity to stop excessively long
searches, and to provide search progress information. The owner window can
respond either with TRUE or FALSE. FALSE causes the MLE to continue searching;
TRUE causes the MLE to stop the search immediately. For further information,
see <A HREF="3000_L3_MLM_SEARCH.html">MLM_SEARCH</A><!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
