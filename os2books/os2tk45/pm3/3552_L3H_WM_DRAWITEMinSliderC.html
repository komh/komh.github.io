<P>
The slider control provides this message to give the application the opportunity
to provide a custom slider shaft, custom ribbon strip, custom slider arm,
and custom background. The application can specify one or all of these items
and is given the opportunity to do so.
<P>
The slider control window procedure generates this message and sends it
to its owner, informing the owner that an item is to be drawn. The owner
is then given the opportunity to draw that item, and to indicate that an
item has been drawn or that the slider control is to draw it.
