<P>
This message takes an insertion point and length as parameters. It assumes
a buffer has been set using <A HREF="3056_L3_MLM_SETIMPORTEXPORT.html">MLM_SETIMPORTEXPORT</A>,
and inserts the contents of the buffer at the insertion point in the text.
 The contents are interpreted as being in the format set by <A HREF="2774_L3_MLM_FORMAT.html">MLM_FORMAT</A>.
If the insertion point is -1, the cursor point is used.
<P>
The insertion point<I> pBegin</I> is updated by the MLE to the point after
the last character imported.  This provides the application with the location
for the next import.
<P>
The return value indicates how many bytes were actually transferred.
<P>
All imports are done in full characters, therefore, if the number of bytes
to be imported results in the last byte transferred being only half of a
DBCS character, or part of a line-break sequence (CR LF or CR CR LF), the
MLE does not transfer that byte. If the return value indicates that less
than the full amount was transferred, a check must be made to determine
if it is the beginning of a multi-byte sequence, and if so, the parts must
be mated and imported as a whole.
<P>
This can cause an overflow, see MLN_OVERFLOW.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The buffer is not zero-terminated; NULL characters can be
inserted into the text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
