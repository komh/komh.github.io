<UL> A key stroke causes the amount
of text to exceed the limit on the number of bytes of data (refer to <A HREF="3102_L3_MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT.html">MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT</A>).
 The parameter contains the number of bytes of data which would not fit
within the current text limit.  For character key strokes this can be 1
or 2 (DBCS).  For Shift+Ins (paste) it can be any amount up to the paste
limit.
<P>
The default<I> rc</I> of FALSE causes the default error handling, which
is to ignore the key stroke, and beep.
<P>
An<I> rc</I> of TRUE implies that corrective action has been taken (such
as deleting existing text or raising the limit) and the <A HREF="3147_L3_WM_CHARinMultilineEn.html">WM_CHAR

<UL> A key
stroke causes the size of the display bit map to exceed the horizontal limit
of the format rectangle (refer to <A HREF="3047_L3_MLM_SETFORMATRECT.html">MLM_SETFORMATRECT</A>).
The parameter contains the number of pels that would not fit within the
current text limit.
<P>
The default<I> rc</I> of FALSE causes the default error handling, which
is to ignore the key stroke, and beep.
<P>
An<I> rc</I> of TRUE implies that corrective action has been taken (such

</UL> MLN_UNDOOVERFLOW
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->

</UL> MLN_MARGIN
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Whenever the user moves the mouse into the left,
right top, or bottom margins, this message is sent to the owner of the window.

<P>
If the owner returns an<I> rc</I> of TRUE, the mouse move is assumed to
have been processed by the owner and no further action need be taken.
<P>
If the owner returns an<I> rc</I> of FALSE, the MLE performs a default action
appropriate to each different mouse action.
<P>
The exceptions to this are all mouse messages that occur after a button-down
inside the margin, until and including the matching button-up.  Conceptually
the drag (button-down until button-up) is a single macro event.  Therefore,
if FALSE is returned for a button-down event, no further margin notifications
are given until after the drag has ended (button-up).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the<!-- entering slot 2700 --> application receives a notification
of button-down in the margin and processes it, it must capture the mouse
until the button-up event.<!-- lm: 0x2 12 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL>This notification is sent periodically by the MLE,
while an <A HREF="3000_L3_MLM_SEARCH.html">MLM_SEARCH</A> message is being
processed, to give an application the opportunity to stop excessively long
searches, and to provide search progress information. The owner window can
respond either with TRUE or FALSE. FALSE causes the MLE to continue searching;
TRUE causes the MLE to stop the search immediately. For further information,

<P>
MLFEFR_RESIZE<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> The window is resized, and the format
rectangle is tied to the window size and limited either horizontally, vertically,
or both.  The implicit change of the format rectangle to the new size does
not contain the text.  The format rectangle is made static at the previous
size, and the MLESFR_MATCHWINDOW style is turned off until set again by
the application.  This is done in response to a <A HREF="4894_L3_WM_SIZE.html">WM_SIZE
</A>message, and therefore the multi-line entry field does not forward the
return value from this notification message.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MLFEFR_TABSTOP
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>A tab stop location change is requested, and the
text is limited either horizontally, vertically, or both.  Changing the
tab stops causes the text to exceed the limit.  The tab stop change is rejected.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>MLFEFR_FONT<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> A font change
is requested, and the text is limited either horizontally, vertically, or
both.  Changing the font causes the text to exceed the limit.  The font
change is rejected.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MLFEFR_WORDWRAP<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> The
word-wrap state is requested to be changed, and the text is limited either
horizontally, vertically, or both.  Wrapping the text differently exceeds
the limit, and the request is rejected.  This happens in situations where
the horizontal limit is not set, there are lines exceeding it, and word-wrap
is being changed from off to on, such that it creates soft line breaks resulting
in increased vertical size.  This happens if word-wrap is being changed
from on to off, and there is at least one line created by a soft line-break,
such that when that line-break is removed, the full line (up to the hard
line break) exceeds the horizontal limit.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MLFEFR_TEXT
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Text is changed by <A HREF="2783_L3_MLM_IMPORT.html">MLM_IMPORT</A>,

<A HREF="3120_L3_MLM_UNDO.html">MLM_UNDO</A>, or <A HREF="2738_L3_MLM_DELETE.html">MLM_DELETE</A>,
and the text is limited either horizontally, vertically, or both within
the format rectangle. The change causes the text to exceed the format rectangle
in a dimension that is limited.  For example, Delete and EOL joins text
from two lines into one line long enough to exceed the horizontal limit.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
