<H1>Container Control Window Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 368 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a container
control (WC_CONTAINER).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
A container control is a visual component whose specific purpose is to hold
objects. These objects, or container items, can be anything that either
your application or a user might store in a container. Examples are executable
programs, word processing files, graphics images, and database records.

<P>
Container item data is stored in<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 93 --> RECORDCORE
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C8 76 --> MINIRECORDCORE</A> data structures.
Both the application and the container have access to the data stored in
these records.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style bit is specified when a container
is created, then<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C8 76 --> MINIRECORDCORE</A> should
be used instead of<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 93 --> RECORDCORE</A> and
PMINIRECORDCORE should be used instead of PRECORDCORE in all applicable
data structures and messages.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
The maximum number of records is limited by the amount of memory in the
user's computer. The container control does not limit the number of records
that a container can have.
<P>
The following list shows which types of data can be displayed for each container
view. Refer to the description of the container control in the<I> OS/2 Programming
Guide</I> for more information about the types of views.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL>
<P>
Direct editing of container item text is supported in all views, including
blank text fields.
<P>
The container control is designed according to the Common User Access (CUA)
guidelines. For example, the CUA direct manipulation protocol is fully supported,
enabling a user to visually drag an object in a container window and drop
it on another object or container window. In addition, the container control
supports CUA-defined selection types and techniques for selecting container
items, as well as selection mechanisms, such as pointing devices and the
keyboard, and multiple forms of emphasis. For a complete description of
CUA containers, refer to the<I> SAA CUA Guide to User Interface Design</I> and
to the<I> SAA CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.
<P>
The container control automatically provides or enables either horizontal
or vertical scroll bars, or both, whenever all or part of one or more container
items are not visible in a container window's client area.
