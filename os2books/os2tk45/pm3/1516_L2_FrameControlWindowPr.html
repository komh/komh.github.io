<H1>Frame Control Window Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 1518 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a frame window
(WC_FRAME). The frame control window procedure sends all messages not processed
to FID_CLIENT and sets<B> reply</B> to 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
The window that contains all of the parts listed below is called the<I> frame
window</I>. Each of the parts that make up a window, such as the title bar
and menu, are separate child windows of the frame window.  All of these
child windows, except the client window (FID_CLIENT), are called<I> frame
controls</I>.
<P>
FID_CLIENT is not a frame control, it is an instance of a window class implemented
by the application.
<P>
The frame window and all of the frame controls are implemented with system-provided
preregistered window classes.
<P>
The frame window holds together all of the frame controls and FID_CLIENT
that make up an application window. The frame window is responsible for
arranging the frame controls and the FID_CLIENT as the frame window is sized
and moved.  It is also responsible for routing specific messages to its
frame controls and the FID_CLIENT.
<P>
Each of the frame controls and FID_CLIENT are known to the frame window
by a system-provided window-identifier value as listed below:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
FID_CLIENT<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Client window<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_HORZSCROLL<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Horizontal scroll bar<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_MENU<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Application menu<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_MINMAX<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Minimize/Maximize box<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_SYSMENU<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> System menu<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_TITLEBAR<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Title bar<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>FID_VERTSCROLL<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL> Vertical scroll bar.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For correct operation, only one window per frame must be defined with each
of the above FID_* values.
