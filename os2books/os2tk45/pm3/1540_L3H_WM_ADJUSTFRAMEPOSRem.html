<P>
When a<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C5 83 --> WinSetWindowPos</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C4 82 --> WinSetMultWindowPos
</A>function involves adjusting the position or size of a frame window,
a WM_ADJUSTFRAMEPOS message is sent to the frame window.
<P>
The frame control processes the message by informing all the windows in
its owner hierarchy, that is all the windows owned by the frame and all
the windows owned by them and so on, by sending each a <A HREF="1657_L3_WM_OWNERPOSCHANGE.html">WM_OWNERPOSCHANGE
</A>message. Each window receiving the a <A HREF="1657_L3_WM_OWNERPOSCHANGE.html">WM_OWNERPOSCHANGE
</A>message is expected to modify the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 68 --> SWP
</A>structure provided as the first parameter in the message to the appropriate
values relative to the new position and/or size of its owner, whose new
position and size is specified in a<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 68 --> SWP
</A>structure provided as the second parameter in the message.
<P>
In this way the frame control can determine the state changes to be made
to all the windows in its owner hierarchy, in accordance with the values
specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 68 --> SWP</A> structure
referenced by the<I> pswp</I> parameter. The rules for changing the state
of these owned windows are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
SWP_SIZE and SWP_MOVE<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The owned window is moved
relative to the top left corner of its owner.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SWP_SHOW
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>The visibility state of an owned window is changed
to agree with that of their owner.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SWP_MINIMIZE
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>An owned window is made invisible when the owner
is minimized.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SWP_MAXIMIZE and SWP_RESTORE<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> An
owned window that was previously made invisible when the owner was minimized
is made visible.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The frame window coordinates the repositioning of the frame window and all
its owned windows, by using the<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C4 81 --> WinSaveWindowPos
</A>function to associate those windows whose states are to change with
the identifier of the frame window repositioning process, that is the<I> hsavewphsvwp
</I>parameter. Eventually, the state changes to be made to the owned windows
are contained in the array of<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 68 --> SWP
</A>structures identified by the parameter.
<P>
If the frame window is subclassed, this message must then be passed to the
superclass window procedure for processing. The superclass window procedure
is the window procedure of the window before it was subclassed. This message
is passed along the chain of window procedures and is eventually processed
by the system frame window procedure.
