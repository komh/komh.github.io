<P>
This message is posted to the queue associated with the window that has
the focus.
<P>
The set of keys that causes a WM_CHAR message is device-dependent.
<P>
When this message is processed, precedence should normally be given to a
valid virtual key if there is one contained in the message.
<P>
There are several instances when a window procedure may receive this message
with the KC_KEYUP bit set, although it did not receive this message for
the down transition of the key.
<P>
For example,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The down transition of the key is translated by the
function<A><!-- external link: 1D 25 C5 FC --> WinTranslateAccel</A>, into
a <A HREF="4321_L3_WM_COMMAND.html">WM_COMMAND</A>, <A HREF="4925_L3_WM_SYSCOMMAND.html">WM_SYSCOMMAND</A>,
<A HREF="4456_L3_WM_HELP.html">WM_HELP</A>, or a <A HREF="4617_L3_WM_NULL.html">WM_NULL
</A>message.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The key down causes the input focus to change (tab
to another window, dismiss a dialog, exit a program, and so on).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Some other event happens that changes the focus between
the time that the key is pressed down and the time that it is released.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Applications should normally only process WM_CHAR messages that do not have
the KC_KEYUP bit set.
<P>
Except for the special instance where the LONEKEY flag is set on an accelerator
key definition, all translations are done on the down stroke of the character.

<P>
When the current character is a double-byte character then<I> param2</I> contains
both bytes of the double-byte character. These bytes are in the order CHAR1FROMMP,
CHAR2FROMMP. When the current character is a single-byte character, CHAR2FROMMP
contains 0.
