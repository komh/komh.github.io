<P>
This message will be posted to the application queue associated with the
window that has the focus, or with the window that is to receive the pointer-button
information.
<P>
WM_PICKUP message is sent to the window under the mouse pointer when the
user presses the direct-manipulation button while holding down the lazy
drag augmentation key, currently the ALT key. This message is used to inform
an application that the user is commencing a lazy drag operation. The container
control sends its owner a <A HREF="563_L3_CN_PICKUP.html">CN_PICKUP</A> notification
when it receives a message.
<P>
Objects are added to the drag set when a WM_PICKUP message is received.
The first time the message is received, the application initiates a lazy
drag operation. Each subsequent WM_PICKUP message that is received during
the course of the lazy drag operation indicates that objects are to be added
to the drag set.
