Messages are processed by window and dialog procedures.
<P>
Every window has a window procedure.  Windows can also be combined into
standard windows or dialog boxes.  These are special cases of groups of
windows that also have their own procedures. A window or dialog procedure
must be capable of processing any message.  This can be achieved by delegating
some message types to the default window, or dialog, procedures by use of
the<A><!-- external link: 1D 1E C4 6A --> WinDefWindowProc</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 1B C4 69 --> WinDefDlgProc
</A>functions respectively.
<P>
Control windows are a special type of child windows.  They take the form
of objects such as buttons, scroll bars, list boxes, and text entry fields.
 These child windows process mouse and keyboard input and notify its owner
of significant input events.  Procedures for these child window controls
are inside the Presentation Manager and are often called system-provided
window procedures.
