<P>
The container control requires that the application use the CM_ALLOCRECORD
message to allocate memory for container records.
<P>
When a record is allocated, the<I> cb</I> field of the record will be initialized
with the size of the record structure type currently in use, either<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 23 --> RECORDCORE
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C8 FC --> MINIRECORDCORE</A>. If the
CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style bit is not specified, the record is allocated according
to the size of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 23 --> RECORDCORE</A> data
structure. However, if the CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style bit is specified, the
record is allocated according to the size of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C8 1D --> MINIRECORDCORE
</A>data structure. This size should not be modified by the application.
