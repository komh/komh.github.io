<H1>Entry Field Control Styles</H1><!-- entering slot 1360 -->These entry field control styles are available:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
ES_LEFT<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The text in the control is left-justified.
This is the default style if neither ES_RIGHT nor ES_CENTER is specified.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ES_RIGHT<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The text in the
control is right-justified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_CENTER<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The
text in the control is centered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_AUTOSIZE<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The
text will be sized to make sure the contents fit.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_AUTOSCROLL
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>If the user tries to move off the end of a line,
the control automatically scrolls one-third the width of the window in the
appropriate direction.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_MARGIN<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> This
style can be used to cause a border to be drawn around the control, with
a margin around the editable text. The margin is half a character-width
wide and half a character-height high.
<P>
When an entry field control with this style is positioned, it adjusts the
position so that the text is placed at the position specified. This position
differs from the original position by the width of the border and the margin.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ES_READONLY<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> This style causes
a single line entry field to be created in read only state.
<P>
When an entry field is in read only state, characters do not get inserted
into the text. However the insertion interface is still functional.
<P>
The entry field read only state can be altered by use of the <A HREF="1464_L3_EM_SETREADONLY.html">EM_SETREADONLY
</A>message.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_UNREADABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> This
style causes the text to be displayed as an asterisk for each character.
It can be used for passwords.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_COMMAND<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> This
style identifies the entry field as a command entry field. This information
is used by the Help Manager to provide command help if the end user requests
help for this field.
<P>
Not more than one entry field on each dialog should be given this style.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ES_AUTOTAB<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> This style indicates
that when the field is filled by adding a character to the end of the entry
field text, the effect of a tab key will be generated. Inserting or replacing
a character in the middle of the text, however, does not result in an autotab.

<P>
This style is recommended for use with fixed-length, non-scrollable fields
that are filled completely. The maximum length of the entry field text is
held in the control data, see<A><!-- external link: 1D EB C7 FC --> ENTRYFDATA</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These entry field controls are intended for countries that use a double-byte
character encoding scheme:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
ES_SBCS<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The text is purely single-byte.
<P>
If the number of characters entered exceeds EM_SETTEXTLIMIT, or a DBCS character
is entered, the alarm sounds and the last character entered is ignored.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ES_DBCS<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The text is purely
double byte.
<P>
If the number of bytes in the entry field exceeds EM_SETTEXTLIMIT, or an
SBCS character is entered, the alarm sounds and the last character entered
is ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_ANY<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The text
is a mixture of SBCS and DBCS characters.
<P>
If the number of bytes in the input field exceeds EM_SETTEXTLIMIT, the alarm
sounds and the last character entered is ignored.
<P>
ES_ANY is the default.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the queue code page is an ASCII code page and the data
in the entry field is to be converted to an EBCDIC code page, there is a
possibility that shift-in and shift-out characters introduced by the conversion
process can cause the converted data to overrun the target field. Coding
ES_MIXED protects the target field from overrun in this situation.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ES_MIXED
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>The text is a mixture of SBCS and DBCS characters
which may subsequently be converted from an ASCII DBCS code page to an EBCDIC
DBCS code page with a consequent possible increase in the length of the
data.
<P>
If
<PRE>DBCSchars*2 + SBCSchars + N &gt; EM_SETTEXTLIMIT</PRE>

<P>
where N starts at 0 and is incremented whenever the string goes from SBCS
to DBCS or DBCS to SBCS, the alarm sounds and the last character entered
is ignored.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For every conversion from SBCS to DBCS there must be a corresponding
return to SBCS (N must be an even number).<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
