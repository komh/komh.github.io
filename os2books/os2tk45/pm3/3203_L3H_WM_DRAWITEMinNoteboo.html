<P>
If an application uses notebook controls that contain tab pages, the default
condition is for the application to draw the contents of the tab each time
a tab page is displayed. This situation applies particularly if the content
of the tab is not one of the supported formats.
<P>
The notebook control window procedure generates this message and sends it
to its owner, informing the owner that the content of a tab is to be drawn.
The owner is given the opportunity to draw the content of the tab and to
indicate that the content of the tab has been drawn or that the notebook
control is to draw it. To indicate that the notebook control is to draw
the content of the tab, the owner sends either a <A HREF="3406_L3_BKM_SETTABTEXT.html">BKM_SETTABTEXT
</A>or a <A HREF="3388_L3_BKM_SETTABBITMAP.html">BKM_SETTABBITMAP</A> message
to the notebook control.
