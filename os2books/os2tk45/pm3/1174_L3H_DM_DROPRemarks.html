<H1>DM_DROP - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1176 -->
<P>
This message is sent to the target window directly under the hot spot of
the mouse pointer at the completion of a direct-manipulation operation only
if DOR_DROP was returned for the <A HREF="1147_L3_DM_DRAGOVER.html">DM_DRAGOVER
</A>message sent to the target window during the drag.
<P>
The receiver can obtain access to<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 1E --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure with<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 FC --> DrgAccessDraginfo</A>.

<P>
The receiver must immediately remove any target emphasis and post a private
message to itself to initiate the data transfer conversations needed to
complete the operation.
<P>
The receiver can use the<I> cxOffset</I> and<I> cyOffset</I> fields in the
<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 1F -->DRAGITEM</A> structure to position
the dropped object within its window relative to the drop point. Multiple
objects are moved in the same relative position to each other in the target
window as they were in the source.
<P>
With standard drag,<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 22 --> DrgDrag</A> does
not return until the drag set is dropped on a target window. Since the source
window is the caller of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 FC --> DrgDrag</A>,
it receives the handle of the target window that the drag set is dropped
on when<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 22 --> DrgDrag</A> returns.
<P>
Lazy Drag is slightly different. Since the drag operation is non-modal,
the<A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C3 24 --> DrgLazyDrag</A> returns as soon
as it has completed its initialization of the drag. <A HREF="1186_L3_DM_DROPNOTIFY.html">DM_DROPNOTIFY
</A>is posted to the source window after the drag set is dropped.
<P>
When the application receiving the DM_DROP message has finished all data
transfer operations, the target window must free the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 1E --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6F C3 FC --> DrgFreeDraginfo</A>.
