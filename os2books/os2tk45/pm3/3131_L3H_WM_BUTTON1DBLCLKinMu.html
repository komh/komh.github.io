This message indicates that mouse button 1 has clicked twice within the
system double-click time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Double-Click<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> If the click point is in the middle
of a non-white-space character, the token (word) surrounding the clicked-on
character, and any trailing spaces, are selected.  If the click point is
in a space character, the previous word (along with the trailing spaces
including the clicked-on space) is selected.  If there is no preceding word
(either because the spaces are at the beginning of the text or immediately
follow a line-break character) the run of spaces is selected.  If the click
point is on a tab or line-break character, that character is selected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Shift-Double-Click
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Double-clicking while the Shift key is pressed leaves
the anchor point alone, and moves the cursor point to the beginning or end
of the clicked-on token.  If the click point is before the anchor point
in the text, the cursor point is moved to the beginning of the surrounding
word, otherwise, the cursor point is moved to the end of the surrounding
word.  When shift-double-clicking, the selection is extended to include
the token that was double-clicked on.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Margin Mouse
Event<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> All mouse events in a margin cause the MLE
to send a MLN_MARGIN notification to the owner window of the MLE. This message
has, as its parameters, the original mouse message. The owner can process
the notification or not.  If the owner does not process the message, the
event is treated as if it occurred on the closest point in the text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
