<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a spin button
control (WC_SPINBUTTON).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
A spin button control (WC_SPINBUTTON window class) is a visual component
whose specific purpose is to give users quick access to a finite set of
data. The spin button allows users to select from a scrollable ring of choices.
Since users can see only one item at a time, the spin button control should
be used only with data that is intuitively related, such as a list of months
of the year, or an alphabetic list of cities or states.
<P>
A spin button consists of at least one spin field that is a single-line
entry field (SLE), and up and down arrows that are stacked on top of one
another. These arrows are positioned at the right of the SLE.
<P>
You can create multifield spin buttons for those applications in which users
must select more than one value. For example, in setting a date the spin
button control can provide individual fields for setting the month, day,
and year. The first spin field in the spin button could contain a list of
months, the second spin field could contain a list of numbers and the third
spin field could contain a list of years.
