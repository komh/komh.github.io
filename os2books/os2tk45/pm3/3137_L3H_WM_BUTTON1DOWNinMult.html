<P>
This message delimits mouse button click events. Between a button-down and
a button-up event, the mouse is considered to be dragging.  A mouse click
is considered to happen on button-down, and dragging is terminated by a
button-up.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

the anchor is extended one character further in the text, subject to the
end-of-text and new-line boundary conditions, defined under <A HREF="3147_L3_WM_CHARinMultilineEn.html">WM_CHAR

Mouse Event<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> All mouse events in a margin cause the
MLE to send a MLN_MARGIN notification to the owner window of the MLE. This
message has, as its parameters, the original mouse message. The owner can
process the notification or not.  If the owner does not process the message,
the event is treated as if it occurred on the closest point in the text.
