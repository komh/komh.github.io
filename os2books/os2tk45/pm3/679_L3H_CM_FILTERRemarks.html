<P>
Filtering is enabled by setting the CRA_FILTERED attribute of container
records that are to be excluded from the viewable subset.
<P>
The<I> pfnFilter</I> parameter points to an application-provided function
that determines whether a record is to be included in the viewable subset.
The<I> pfnFilter</I> parameter must be declared as:
<PRE>BOOL PFN <I>pfnFilter</I> (
     PRECORDCORE <B>p</B>,
     PVOID <I>pStorage</I>);
</PRE>

<P>
where<B> p</B> points to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 64 --> RECORDCORE
</A>structure that describes the container record to be tested. The<I> pfnFilter
</I>parameter returns TRUE if the record is to be included in the viewable
subset, or FALSE if it is to be excluded.  The container sets the CRA_FILTERED
attribute for the record based on the return from the<I> pfnFilter</I> parameter.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style bit is specified when a container
is created, then<A><!-- external link: 1D 29 C8 49 --> MINIRECORDCORE</A> should
be used instead of<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 64 --> RECORDCORE</A> and
PMINIRECORDCORE should be used instead of PRECORDCORE in all applicable
data structures and messages.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
If the CRA_FILTERED attribute is set for the record, the record is not visible.
If the CCS_AUTOPOSITION style bit is set and the container is showing the
icon view, the container records are arranged when a record is filtered
out.
<P>
The CM_FILTER message supports only one level of filtering.
<P>
It is the application's responsibility to provide a National Language Support-enabled
(NLS-enabled) function for the<I> pfnFilter</I> parameter.
<P>
If the<I> pfnFilter</I> parameter value is NULL, a container is returned
to an unfiltered state. If functions such as inserting a record into a container,
arranging the records, or sorting the records are performed on a container
whose records have been filtered, the effect of these functions remains
if the container records are later unfiltered.
<P>
All messages act on the entire container. For example, a record that is
filtered and is removed from the container will be removed from the container
entirely; it is not present in the container when the container records
are unfiltered.
