The application uses this message to customize the slider for a specific
use. In setting the shaft dimensions, only the breadth of the slider can
be set. The length of the shaft is always determined by the number of increments
and the spacing between increments, both of which are set for the primary
scale when the slider is created.
<P>
Positioning of the shaft within the slider window could be used by applications
that cannot use the default positioning provided by the slider control.

<P>
Setting of the slider arm dimensions could be used by applications that
need a larger slider arm, such as touch screen applications.
<P>
