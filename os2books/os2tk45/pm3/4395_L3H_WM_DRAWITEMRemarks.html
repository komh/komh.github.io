<P>
A control can only display some types of information, and emphasize items
in a control-specific manner. Therefore, if special items are to be displayed
or emphasized in a special manner, this must be done by the owner window
of the control.
<P>
The control window procedure generates this message and sends it to the
owner of the control, informing the owner that an item is to be drawn, offering
the owner the opportunity to draw that item and to indicate that either
the item has been drawn or that the control is to draw it.
