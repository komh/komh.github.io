<P>
This message can be used to change the size of the grid squares after a
grid has been created.
<P>
The only fields in the GRIDINFO structure that can be set by the application
are the<I> cb</I>,<I> cxGrid</I>,<I> cyGrid</I>, and<I> pGrid</I> fields.
If the<I> cxGrid</I> and<I> cyGrid</I> fields are nonzero and the<I> pGrid
</I>field is NULL, the container creates a grid with grid squares of width
<I>cxGrid</I> and height<I> cyGrid</I>.
<P>
If<I> cxGrid</I> and<I> cyGrid</I> are zero, the container will create default
size grid squares. It is not necessary to send this message to create default
size grid squares, because they will be created the first time an arrange
with the CM_ARRANGEGRID option is performed.
<P>
The application can completely control the placement of icons by marking
the squares it wants occupied and then sending the CM_ARRANGE message with
<I>mp1</I> equal to CMA_ARRANGEGRID and<I> mp2</I> equal to CMA_USER. Here
is how the application uses CM_SETGRIDINFO to mark the squares:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the<I> pGrid</I> field of the GRIDINFO structure
is non-NULL, the container expects a pointer that points to an array of
GRIDSQUARE structures, one for each available grid square in the grid. In
this case, the<I> cxGrid</I> and<I> cyGrid</I> fields are ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The container uses the grid square array to mark the
grid squares as available or unavailable. If the<I> ulState</I> field of
the GRIDSQUARE structure is marked CMA_AVAIL, the square can be occupied
by an icon; if it is marked CMA_UNAVAIL, it is not available.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Marking of grid squares is used only when the arrangement pattern is CMA_USER
and has no effect on the placement of icons when any other pattern is specified.
