<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO</A> structures are removed
from the list of columns inserted into the container control.
<P>
If the CMA_FREE attribute is not specified, the container control removes
the specified<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO</A> structures
without freeing the memory. The application is responsible for freeing the
memory associated with the<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO
</A>structures by using the <A HREF="682_L3_CM_FREEDETAILFIELDIN.html">CM_FREEDETAILFIELDINFO
</A>message.
<P>
If the<I> cNumFieldInfo</I> parameter has a value of 0 and the CMA_FREE
attribute is specified, all of the<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO
</A>structures in the container control are removed and the memory associated
with the<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO</A> structures
is freed. It is the application's responsibility to free all of the application-allocated
memory associated with the<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO
</A>structures.
<P>
If the number of pointers to<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO
</A>structures in the array exceeds the count of<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO
</A>structures to be removed, only the number of structures specified in
the<I> cNumFieldInfo</I> parameter are removed. If the CCS_VERIFYPOINTERS
style bit is set and the<I> pFieldInfoArray</I> parameter contains pointers
to a<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO</A> structure or structures
that do not exist, the PMERR_INVALID_PARAMETERS error is set.
<P>
If you do not want to show a column, you can hide it by setting the CFA_INVISIBLE
attribute of the<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C7 22 --> FIELDINFO</A> data
structure and notifying the container control with the <A HREF="736_L3_CM_INVALIDATEDETAILF.html">CM_INVALIDATEDETAILFIELDINFO
</A>message.
<P>
If the CMA_INVALIDATE attribute is specified, the container is repainted.
