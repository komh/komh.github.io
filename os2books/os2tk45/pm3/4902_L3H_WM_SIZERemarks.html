<P>
This message is not sent by<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 4A --> WinCreateWindow
</A>when a window is created, and so any size-related processing must be
done during the <A HREF="4362_L3_WM_CREATE.html">WM_CREATE</A> message processing
in this instance.
<P>
This message is sent after the window has been actually sized, but before
any repainting has been done. Any resizing or repositioning of child windows
that might be necessary a a result of the size change is usually done during
the processing of this message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is generally unwise to output to the window during the
processing of this message, because the area drawn might be redrawn, after
the WM_SIZE processing is complete, by the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C5 4D --> WinSetWindowPos
</A>function.
<P>
The processing of this message for a window which is displaying an advanced
VIO presentation space must be carried out by the default advanced VIO window
procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
