<P>
The target sends this message to a source window to request a rendering
of an object. If the source returns FALSE, it may set flags in the<A><!-- external link: 1D E9 C7 0B --> DRAGTRANSFER
</A>structure that tell the target how to perform the rendering operation
on its own, or how to retry the operation.  If no flags are set, the source
will not allow a rendering of the object.
<P>
If TRUE is returned, the message was processed by the recipient and the
requested rendering will take place.  The source will post a <A HREF="1240_L3_DM_RENDERCOMPLETE.html">DM_RENDERCOMPLETE
</A>message to the target when the rendering is complete.
<P>
If FALSE is returned, either the message was not processed by the recipient,
or the recipient could not perform the requested rendering. See<I> fsReply
