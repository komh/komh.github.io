<H1>Slider Control Styles</H1><!-- entering slot 3535 -->
<P>
Slider control window styles are set when a slider window is created. The
following styles can be set when creating a slider control window. If no
styles are specified, defaults, which are identified in the following descriptions,
are used.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Specify either of the following to determine the slider's
orientation:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
SLS_HORIZONTAL<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider is positioned horizontally.
The slider arm can move left and right on the slider shaft. A scale can
be placed on top of the slider shaft, below the slider shaft, or in both
places. This is the default orientation of the slider.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_VERTICAL
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is positioned vertically. The slider
arm can move up and down the slider shaft. A scale can be placed on the
left side of the slider shaft, on the right side of the slider shaft, or
in both places.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Specify
one of the following to position the slider within the slider window:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
SLS_CENTER<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider is centered in the slider
window. This is the default positioning of the slider.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_BOTTOM
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is positioned at the bottom of the slider
window. This is valid for horizontal sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_TOP
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is positioned at the top of the slider
window. This is valid for horizontal sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_LEFT
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is positioned at the left edge of the
slider window. This is valid for vertical sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_RIGHT
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is positioned at the right edge of the
slider window. This is valid for vertical sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Specify
one of the following to determine the location of the scale on the slider
shaft:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
SLS_PRIMARYSCALE1<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider uses the increment
and spacing specified for scale 1 as the incremental value for positioning
the slider arm. Scale 1 is displayed above the slider shaft of a horizontal
slider and to the right of the slider shaft of a vertical slider. This is
the default for a slider.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_PRIMARYSCALE2<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The
slider uses the increment and spacing specified for scale 2 as the incremental
value for positioning the slider arm. Scale 2 is displayed below the slider
shaft of a horizontal slider and to the left of the slider shaft of a vertical
slider.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Specify
one of the following to determine the slider arm's home position:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
SLS_HOMELEFT<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider uses the left edge of the
slider as the base value for incrementing. This is the default for horizontal
sliders and is valid for horizontal sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_HOMERIGHT
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider uses the right edge of the slider as
the base value for incrementing. This is valid for horizontal sliders only.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>SLS_HOMEBOTTOM<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider
uses the bottom of the slider as the base value for incrementing. This is
the default for vertical sliders and is valid for vertical sliders only.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>SLS_HOMETOP<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider
uses the top of the slider as the base value for incrementing. This is valid
for vertical sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Specify
one of the following to determine the location of the slider buttons. If
you do not specify one of these styles, or if conflicting styles are specified,
slider buttons are not included in the slider control.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
SLS_BUTTONSLEFT<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider includes incremental
slider buttons with the control and places them to the left of the slider
shaft. These slider buttons move the slider arm by one position, either
left or right, in the direction that is selected. This is valid for horizontal
sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_BUTTONSRIGHT<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The
slider includes incremental slider buttons with the control and places them
to the right of the slider shaft. These slider buttons move the slider arm
by one position, either left or right, in the direction that is selected.
This is valid for horizontal sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_BUTTONSBOTTOM
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider includes incremental slider buttons
with the control and places them at the bottom of the slider shaft. These
slider buttons move the slider arm by one position, either up or down, in
the direction that is selected. This is valid for vertical sliders only.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>SLS_BUTTONSTOP<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider
includes incremental slider buttons with the control and places them at
the top of the slider shaft. These slider buttons move the slider arm by
one position, either up or down, in the direction that is selected. This
is valid for vertical sliders only.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Other
styles that you can specify:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
SLS_SNAPTOINCREMENT<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The slider arm, when moved
to a position between two specified values on the slider scale, such as
between two tick marks, is positioned on the nearest value and is redrawn
at that position. If this style is not specified, the slider arm remains
at the position to which it is moved.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_READONLY
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>The slider is created as a read-only slider. This
means that the user cannot interact with the slider. It is used merely as
a mechanism to present a quantity to the user, such as the percentage of
completion of an ongoing task. Visual differences for a read-only slider
include a narrow slider arm, no slider buttons and no detents.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> SLS_RIBBONSTRIP
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>As the slider arm moves, the slider fills the slider
shaft between the home position and the slider arm with a color value that
is different from the slider shaft color, similar to the mercury in a thermometer.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>SLS_OWNERDRAW<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> The application
is notified whenever the slider shaft, the ribbon strip, the slider arm,
and the slider background are to be drawn.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
