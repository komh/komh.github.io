This message delimits mouse button click events. Between a button-down and
a button-up event the mouse is considered to be dragging.  A mouse click
is considered to happen on button-down, and dragging is terminated by a
button-up.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> All mouse events in a margin
cause the MLE to send a MLN_MARGIN notification to the owner window of the
MLE. This message has, as its parameters, the original mouse message. The
owner can process the notification or not.  If the owner does not process
the message, the event is treated as if it occurred on the closest point
in the text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
