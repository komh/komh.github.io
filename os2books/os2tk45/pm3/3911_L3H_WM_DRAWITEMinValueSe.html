<P>
The value set control draws only items that are represented in one of the
formats described:  text, color, bit maps, or icons.
<P>
If an application uses value set controls that contain items that are not
represented by the supported formats or requires that the emphasized attribute
of an item is to be drawn in a special manner, the application must specify
those items as VIA_OWNERDRAW and those items must be drawn by the owner.

<P>
Through this message, the application can provide a custom value set background
(the area between the items) and customize the area surrounding the value
set (the area on the top and right sides of the value set that is left over
when the value set calculates its size). The application can specify how
either or both of these areas are drawn and is given the opportunity to
do so.
<P>
The value set control window procedure generates this message and sends
it to its owner, informing the owner that something is to be drawn. The
owner is given the opportunity to draw and to indicate whether the value
set control should continue with the normal drawing of that component.
