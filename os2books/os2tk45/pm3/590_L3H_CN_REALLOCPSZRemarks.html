<P>
The CN_REALLOCPSZ notification code is sent after direct editing of container
text is complete. It notifies the application that the container is about
to copy the changed text to the application's text string. This allows the
application to ensure that the correct amount of memory is allocated to
accommodate the change.
<P>
If TRUE is returned by the application, the container control copies the
new text to the application's text string. However, if the application returns
FALSE, changed text is disregarded.
<P>
<B>Warning:</B> Once your application receives the CN_REALLOCPSZ notification
code, it must not send any messages to the container until it receives the
<A HREF="495_L3_CN_ENDEDIT.html">CN_ENDEDIT</A> notification code, which
indicates that direct editing of container text has ended. If any messages
are sent to the container before your application receives the <A HREF="495_L3_CN_ENDEDIT.html">CN_ENDEDIT
</A>notification code, the results of direct editing are unpredictable.
