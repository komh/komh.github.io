As the clipboard owner is responsible for displaying the clipboard contents,
this message notifies the clipboard application that its client area needs
repainting. The WM_PAINTCLIPBOARD message is sent to the owner of the clipboard
to request repainting of all or part of the client area of the clipboard
application.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To determine whether the entire client area needs repainting
or just a portion of it, the clipboard owner must compare the dimensions
of the drawing area to the dimensions given in the most recent <A HREF="305_L3_WM_SIZECLIPBOARD.html">WM_SIZECLIPBOARD
