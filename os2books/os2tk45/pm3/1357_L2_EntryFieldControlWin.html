<H1>Entry Field Control Window Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 1359 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on an entry
field control (WC_ENTRYFIELD).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
An entry field control is a rectangular window that displays a single line
of text that the operator can edit. When it has the focus, the cursor marks
the current<B> insertion</B> or<B> replacement</B> point.
<P>
When working with entry fields, the <A HREF="4342_L3_WM_CONTROL.html">WM_CONTROL
</A>message is of major concern. An entry-field control communicates with
its owner by sending <A HREF="4342_L3_WM_CONTROL.html">WM_CONTROL</A> messages.
It contains a notification code in MP1 and a handle to the current entry
field in MP2.  The return value for <A HREF="4342_L3_WM_CONTROL.html">WM_CONTROL
</A>is 0.  Notification codes are denoted by an EN prefix.
