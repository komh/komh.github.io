This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a button
control (WC_BUTTON).

<P>
A button control is a small rectangular child window representing a button
that the operator can "switch" on or off. Button controls can be used alone
or in groups, and can either be labeled or appear without text.  Button
controls typically change appearance when the operator clicks a pointing
device on them or pressing the space bar when the button has the keyboard
focus.
<P>
Buttons can be disabled to prevent them from responding when the operator
clicks on them. Disabled buttons are displayed using a different emphasis
technique (for example, color or half-toning).
