<P>
For any insertion point, the number of bytes between that insertion point
and the end of the line is returned.  If the insertion point is -1, the
cursor position is used. If the line contains a hard line-break, it is counted
as one byte.
<P>
The term line means a line on the display after the application of word-wrap.
It does not mean a line as defined by the CR LF line-break sequence, although
a display line might be terminated by such a sequence.
