<P>
This message works only for notebooks with the styles BKS_TABBEDDIALOG and
BKS_BUTTONAREA.
<P>
All notebook buttons are created as children of the notebook window and
must have an ID of less than BKA_MAXBUTTONID. An application can send messages
to the notebook buttons but is also responsible for making sure that they
are in the expected state when a new page is turned to.
<P>
The notebook buttons created using this message will be displayed for all
pages in the notebook, except for pages containing other push buttons with
the BS_NOTEBOOKBUTTON style. WM_COMMAND, WM_SYSCOMMAND, and WM_HELP messages
from these buttons are passed on to the top page window procedure for processing.

<P>
The notebook is responsible for destroying buttons created by this message.
