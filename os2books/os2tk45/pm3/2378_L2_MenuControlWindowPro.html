<H1>Menu Control Window Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 2380 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a menu control
(WC_MENU).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
A menu control is a child or pull-down window that contains a list of selection
items. These items can be represented by text strings, separators, bit maps
or menu buttons. Menu templates can be loaded as resources and the menu
can be created automatically when the parent window is created. The application
can build the menu dynamically by sending <A HREF="2461_L3_MM_INSERTITEM.html">MM_INSERTITEM
</A>messages. An application can change a menu by sending messages to it.

<P>
Menus enable the operator to select one of the items in the list, using
the pointing device or the keyboard. When a selection is made, the menu
parent is notified by posting a <A HREF="4321_L3_WM_COMMAND.html">WM_COMMAND</A>,
<A HREF="4925_L3_WM_SYSCOMMAND.html">WM_SYSCOMMAND</A>, or <A HREF="4456_L3_WM_HELP.html">WM_HELP
</A>message and a unique identifier representing the operator's selection.

<P>
Menus automatically resize themselves when items are added and removed.
Menus are automatically destroyed when their owner is destroyed.
<P>
Typically, an application has an action bar menu and several submenus. The
action bar is normally visible, and is a child window in the parent window
frame. The submenus are normally hidden and become visible when selections
are made on the action bar.
