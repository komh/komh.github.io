<P>
This message is posted to the source window procedure. The source window
procedure is responsible for interpreting the structure given by<I> param2</I>.
It should make a copy of all the parameters and then return.
<P>
The receiver of this message should create a thread in which to dispatch
this message in order to facilitate a prompt reply. The thread can then
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 19 --> DevPostDeviceModes</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 18 --> DevOpenDC
</A>as appropriate.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Technically, the message is sent, but it is from a spun-off
thread so the effect is that of a posted message - it is not synchronous.

<P>
All the drag and drop protocol messages occur synchronously during the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 20 --> DrgDrag
</A>call. If the DM_PRINTOBJECT message is returned to the application asynchronously,
by the time the application gets the message, the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 1D --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure (and<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 1E --> DRAGITEM</A> inside)
have already been freed. The application will trap when it tries to use
<I>param1</I> of the DM_PRINTOBJECT message (the pointer to the<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 1E --> DRAGITEM
</A>data structure).
<P>
For debugging purposes, the application can keep a static copy of the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 1D --> DRAGINFO
</A>pointer and use<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 1F --> DrgAccessDraginfo
</A>to reaccess the shared<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 1D --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure during DM_PRINTOBJECT message processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
