If the rendering operation failed for any reason, the source can allow the
target to retry the operation. The source should return to the state it
was in when the drop occurred for that object. The target resumes the rendering
operation from the beginning.
<P>
If the rendering operation encounters a permanent failure, the source should
fail the operation and proceed as if the rendering was completed.
<P>
If the rendering operation completes successfully, the source should return
to the state it was in when the drop occurred for that object. This allows
the target to retry the operation if its portion of the rendering failed.
The target must post a <A HREF="1204_L3_DM_ENDCONVERSATION.html">DM_ENDCONVERSATION
