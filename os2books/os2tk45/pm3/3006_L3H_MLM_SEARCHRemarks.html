<H1>MLM_SEARCH - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 3012 -->
<P>
This message searches the MLE text for a specified string, starting at a
specified insertion point and continuing until the second specified insertion
point has been reached, or the requested string has been matched.
<P>
When an MLM_SEARCH message is sent, the text is scanned starting with the
character that follows the insertion point indicated in the<I> iptStart
</I>field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 2A C8 FC --> MLE_SEARCHDATA</A> structure.
 The search proceeds until the point indicated in the<I> iptStop</I> field,
until a match is found, or until TRUE is returned from MLN_SEARCHPAUSE notification
(see <A HREF="2683_L3_WM_CONTROLinMultilin.html">WM_CONTROL (in Multiline
Entry Fields)</A>). If a negative value is specified for the<I> iptStart</I>,
the current cursor point is used.  If a negative value is specified for
<I>iptStop</I>, the end of the text is used.  If<I> iptStop</I>, is less
than or equal to<I> iptStart</I>, after performing the two indicated substitutions,
the search wraps from the end of the text to the beginning of the text.

<P>
If the MLFSEARCH_CASESENSITIVE option is specified, the bytes of the search
string must exactly match those in the text.  If MLFSEARCH_CASESENSITIVE
is not specified, the<A><!-- external link: 1D 2A C5 B2 --> WinUpperChar
</A>of the search string must match the<A><!-- external link: 1D 2A C5 B2 --> WinUpperChar
</A>of the text.
<P>
When a match is found, the<I> iptStart</I> field of the search specification
structure is set to indicate the insertion point immediately preceding the
first character of the match, and the<I> cchFind</I> field is set to indicate
the number of characters in the match.  The cursor selection is not altered
unless MLFSEARCH_SELECTMATCH is specified.  If it is, an <A HREF="3074_L3_MLM_SETSEL.html">MLM_SETSEL
</A>is done with the anchor point at<I> iptStart</I> and the cursor at<I> iptStart
</I>+<I> cchFind</I>.
<P>
While searching, the MLE occasionally sends an MLN_SEARCHPAUSE notification
message.  If the owner responds to this message with the value TRUE, the
MLE stops the search. When a search is stopped from MLN_SEARCHPAUSE,<I> iptStart
</I>is set to the point where the search terminated. If the response is
FALSE, the search continues (see also the definition of MLN_SEARCHPAUSE).
The interval at which MLN_SEARCHPAUSE notifications are sent is implementation-dependent,
but must not exceed reasonable user-response thresholds, nor should it be
so often as to introduce undue messaging overhead. Sending this notification
every half second is a reasonable compromise.
<P>
When no match is found the<I> iptStart</I> value is unchanged.
<P>
If the application needs to continue the search, the proper way is to change
the<I> iptStart</I> value to be the point following the string found, adjusting
for any text changes done after the search that may have moved the relative
location of the point.
<P>
Applications using this message are advised to change the system pointer
to the wait icon (clock face) if it is expected that the search will take
some time.
