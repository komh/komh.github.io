<P>
The font dialog provides this message to give the application the opportunity
to provide a custom drawn preview area.
<P>
The font dialog default dialog procedure generates this message and sends
it to its owner, informing the owner that the preview area is to be drawn.
The owner is then given the opportunity to draw that area and to indicate
that the area has been drawn or that the font dialog is to draw it.
