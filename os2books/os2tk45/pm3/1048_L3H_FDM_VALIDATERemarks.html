<P>
This message is only sent just before the dialog returns to the caller with
the user-selected file name.  Before this message is sent,<I> pFileName
</I>is updated with the user-selected file name. The application can determine
if this file name is acceptable. For instance, if the file dialog is being
used to pick a "SaveAs" file name, the application can check to see if the
file is read-only. If it is, a warning dialog should be brought up to notify
the user.
<P>
When FALSE is returned from a FDM_VALIDATE message, the dialog will not
be dismissed and the user can continue to use the File Dialog to select
an alternate file.
<P>
In multiple file selection dialogs this message is sent for each selected
entry within the file list box. When the name of the file being validated
comes from a selected entry in the list box,<I> param2</I> will contain
FDS_LBSELECTION.  When the name of the file comes from the file name entry
field,<I> param2</I> will contain FDS_EFSELECTION.  Single file selection
dialogs will always return FDS_EFSELECTION in<I> param2</I> since the returned
file name always comes from the single line entry field.
