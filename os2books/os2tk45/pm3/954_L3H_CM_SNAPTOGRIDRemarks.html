<H1>CM_SNAPTOGRID - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 956 -->
<P>
Because of the implementation of direct manipulation in OS/2, the snap-to-grid
property requires cooperation from the application.
<P>
Items being dragged are represented by DRAGITEM structures. This structure
contains the<I> ulItemID</I> field, which is available for application use.
Applications usually use this field to identify the object being dragged.
To provide flexibility to applications, the value in the field can vary
from application to application. The most natural value for this field when
dragging objects within a container would be the RECORDCORE pointer. However
the field can also be a pointer to an application-defined structure that
contains many fields (possibly including the RECORDCORE pointer).
<P>
Because<I> ulItemID</I> can have more than one interpretation, the container
must be told which records are to be repositioned and where to begin the
repositioning. An application can do this by iterating through the DRAGITEM
structures (provided by the CN_DROP notification) and creating a linked
list of container records to be repositioned or snapped to the grid. The
point to begin the positioning from can be obtained directly from the DRAGINFO
structure passed on the CN_DROP notification.
<P>
Grid squares that are marked partial (the CMA_PARTIAL bit is set in the
<I>ulState</I> field of the GRIDSQUARE structure) can be used for the Snap-To-Grid
property.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This message returns FALSE if the current view is not CV_GRID.
