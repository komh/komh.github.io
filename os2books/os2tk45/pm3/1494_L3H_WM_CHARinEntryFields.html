The entry field control window procedure responds to this message by sending
it to its owner if it has not processed the keystroke. This is the most
common means by which the input focus is switched around the various controls
in a dialog box.
<P>
Unlike other controls, the<I> usvk</I> field of the message <A HREF="4288_L3_WM_CHAR.html">WM_CHAR
</A>takes precedence over other fields only when the Shift key is pressed.

<P>
If this message contains a valid<I> usch</I> field of the message <A HREF="4288_L3_WM_CHAR.html">WM_CHAR</A>.
that character is entered into the text in insert or overtype mode.
