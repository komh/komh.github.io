<H1>Purpose</H1><!-- entering slot 142 -->The circular slider control supports values set
in analog rather than digital form. This control is intended to emulate
the actual controls of stereo and video components.
<P>
The circular slider can be used instead of a linear slider. While, at present,
there are no particular guidelines as to when a circular slider should replace
a linear slider, the circular slider consumes less space on the screen and,
therefore, is practical to represent several controls in the same window.
For example, for an audio attributes dialog that has volume, balance, bass,
and treble controls, you might want to use a linear slider for the volume
control (since it is used frequently); but to conserve space and give a
more familiar appearance, the circular slider could be used for the balance,
bass, and treble.
