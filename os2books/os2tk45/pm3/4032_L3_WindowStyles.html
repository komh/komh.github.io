These window styles are available:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
WS_SYNCPAINT<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->

This style is set for windows that have Class Style CS_SYNCPAINT. Applications
can then turn this style on and off to vary the window processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
System-Provided Window Styles:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
WS_ANIMATE<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> This specifies that window animation
will be turned on. Windows animation is a visual effect that occurs when
the window is opened or closed;  the window seems to zoom out when it is
opened, and zoom in when it is closed.
<P>
This visual effect also depends on the Animation setting in the System-Settings
notebook.  If Animation is enabled and this window style is set, window
animation occurs when the window is opened or closed. When Animation is
disabled in the System-Settings notebook, this style has no effect and no
window animation occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WS_CLIPCHILDREN<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> This
specifies that the area occupied by the children of a window is to be excluded
when drawing in that window.  Normally, it is included.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WS_CLIPSIBLINGS

When a window is moved or sized in the normal way at least one border should

as large as the screen all borders should be positioned just outside the
screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WS_MINIMIZED<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> This
