<P>
When parent item records are removed, all associated child item records
are removed, as well.
<P>
If the CMA_FREE attribute is not specified, the container control removes
the specified<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE</A> structures
without freeing the memory. The application is responsible for freeing the
memory associated with the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE
</A>structure by using the <A HREF="691_L3_CM_FREERECORD.html">CM_FREERECORD
</A>message.
<P>
If the<I> cNumRecord</I> parameter has a value of 0 and the CMA_FREE attribute
is specified, all of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE
</A>structures in the container control are removed and the memory associated
with the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE</A> structures
is freed. It is the application's responsibility to free all of the application-allocated
memory associated with the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE
</A>structures.
<P>
If the number of pointers to<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE
</A>structures in the array exceeds the count of<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C --> RECORDCORE
</A>structures to be removed, only the number of records specified in the
<I>cNumRecord</I> parameter is removed. If the CCS_VERIFYPOINTERS style
bit is set and the<I> pRecordArray</I> parameter contains pointers to a
<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C8 3C -->RECORDCORE</A> structure or structures
that do not exist, the PMERR_INVALID_PARAMETERS error is set.
<P>
If the CMA_INVALIDATE attribute is specified, the container is repainted
if the removed record or records are visible.
