<H1>Value Set Control Window Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 3893 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a value set
control (WC_VALUESET).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
Like radio buttons, a value set control (WC_VALUESET window class) is a
visual component whose specific purpose is to allow a user to select one
choice from a group of mutually exclusive choices. However, unlike radio
buttons, a value set can use graphical images (bit maps or icons), as well
as colors, text, and numbers, to represent the items that a user can select.

<P>
Even though text is supported, a value set's primary purpose is to display
choices as graphical images. By using graphical images in a value set, you
can preserve space on the display screen. You can also allow the user to
see exactly what is being selected instead of having to rely on descriptions
of the choices. This allows a user to make a selection faster than if the
user had to read a description of each choice. For example, if you want
to allow a user to choose from a variety of patterns, you can present those
patterns as value set choices instead of having to provide a list of radio
buttons with description of each pattern.
<P>
If long strings of data are to be displayed as choices, radio buttons should
be used. However, for small sets of numeric or textual data information,
either a value set or radio buttons can be used.
<P>
The value set is designed to be customizable to meet varying application
requirements, while providing an easy-to-use user interface component that
can be used to develop products that conform to the Common User Access (CUA)
user interface guidelines. The application can specify different types of
items, sizes, and orientations for its value sets, but the underlying function
of the control remains the same. For a complete description of CUA value
sets, refer to the<I> SAA CUA Guide to User Interface Design</I> and the
<I>SAA CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.
