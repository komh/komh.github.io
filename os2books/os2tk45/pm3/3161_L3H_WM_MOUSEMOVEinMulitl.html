<P>
The mouse pointer moves and is of interest to the MLE.  If refresh is disabled,
the pointer is set to the wait icon (a clock face). If refresh is enabled,
the pointer is set to an I-beam. This message can occur during dragging
or when simply tracking the mouse.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Dragging<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Dragging sets the selection anchor to be
the point where dragging begins, and moves the cursor point along with it
as the mouse is moved. Moving the pointer into the margins while dragging
produces a scroll in the appropriate direction and continues selecting.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Margin Mouse Event<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> All mouse
events in a margin cause the MLE to send a MLN_MARGIN notification to the
owner window MLE. This message has, as its parameters, the original mouse
message. The owner can process the notification or not.  If the owner does
not process the message, the event is treated as if it occurred on the closest
point in the text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
