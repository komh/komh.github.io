<H1>Menu Control Styles</H1><!-- entering slot 2381 -->
<P>
These menu control styles are available:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
MS_ACTIONBAR<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The items in the list are displayed
side-by-side. This style is used to implement a top level menu. Menus that
do not have this style are displayed in one or more columns and are submenus
associated with an action bar.
<P>
All menu controls have styles CS_SYNCPAINT and CS_PARENTCLIP.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MS_CONDITIONALCASCADE
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>This style is used to specify that the items in
this list are a conditional cascade menu.  Conditional cascade menus act
like normal cascade menus with the exception that the cascade does not automatically
open when the user selects it.  To open the conditional cascade menu, the
mini-pushbutton on the menu item must be selected.  If the menu is selected
without opening the cascade, the default item in the cascade is selected.
 The default action on the cascade is identified by a check mark.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MS_TITLEBUTTON
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Used to identify menus that can be used as buttons
in the title bar. Can only be used with MS_ACTIONBAR.
<P>
This style causes the menu to be drawn using the CUA colors specified for
the title bar rather than the action bar.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MS_VERTICALFLIP
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Normally, pull-down menus (the default, without
the MS_VERTICALFLIP style) are displayed below their associated action bar
item. If there is not room on the screen to display the entire pull-down
in this manner, and if there is room to display the pull-down above the
action bar, it is displayed above the action bar. Pull-down menus with the
MS_VERTICALFLIP style are flipped vertically. That is, they are displayed
above the menu if possible, otherwise below it. The vertical flip style
must be set explicitly by the application when the window is minimized,
and must be reset when it is restored.
<P>
If an application action bar contains this style, the style is applied to
all pull-down menus belonging to the action bar (the style does not directly
affect the display of the action bar). This provides a convenient means
for the application to flip the appearance of all pull-down menus.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
