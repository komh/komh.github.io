<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL>Makes the mid-point tick mark larger.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CSS_NOBUTTON
<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL>Does not display value buttons.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CSS_NONUMBER
<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL>Does not display the value on the dial.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CSS_NOTEXT
<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL>Does not display title text under the dial.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CSS_POINTSELECT
<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL>Permits the values on the circular slider to change
immediately when dragged.
<P>
Direct manipulation is performed by using a mouse to click on and drag the
circular slider. There are two modes of direct manipulation for the circular
slider.
<P>
The default direct manipulation mode is to<I> scroll</I> to the value indicated
by the position of the mouse. This could be important if you used a circular
slider for a volume control, for example. Increasing the volume from 0%
to 100% too quickly could result in damage to both the user's ears and the
equipment.
<P>
The other mode of direct manipulation permits the value on the circular
slider to change immediately when dragged. This mode is enabled using the
CSS_POINTSELECT style bit. When this style is used, the value of the dial
can be changed by tracking the value with the mouse, which changes values
quickly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CSS_PROPORTIONALTICKS<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Allow
the length of the tick marks to be calculated as a percentage of the radius.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CSS_360<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Permits the scroll
range to extend 360 degrees.
<P>
CSS_360 forces the CSS_NONUMBER style on. This is necessary to keep the
value indicator from corrupting the number value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
