<H1>Default Window Procedure Message Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 4037 -->
<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions that control
the operation of windows.
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
General window messages are used for standard processing.  These messages
can be requested from the system or sent to the system for information,
or for actions such as create window, validate window, track mouse movement,
and select and deselect actions.
<P>
<B>Reserved Messages</B>
<P>
These message ranges are reserved:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
WM_USER<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> All messages below this value are reserved
for system use. Private messages must have an identifier with a value of
WM_USER or higher.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The operating system uses certain message values higher than
WM_USER. These message values should not be used by an application. A partial
listing of these messages is in the following figure:
<PRE>
From PMSTDDLG.H:

#define FDM_FILTER       WM_USER+40
#define FDM_VALIDATE     WM_USER+41
#define FDM_ERROR        WM_USER+42

#define FNTM_FACENAMECHANGED   WM_USER+50
#define FNTM_POINTSIZECHANGED  WM_USER+51
#define FNTM_STYLECHANGED      WM_USER+52
#define FNTM_COLORCHANGED      WM_USER+53
#define FNTM_UPDATEPREVIEW     WM_USER+54
#define FNTM_FILTERLIST        WM_USER+55

</PRE>
You should scan your header files to see if other messages have been defined
with values higher than WM_USER.<!-- lm: 0x2 13 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>General Window Styles</B>
<P>
The<I> window</I> is the mechanism by which the application communicates
with the operator. Each window can have a window<I> style</I> that controls
the appearance and behavior of the window. There are also<I> class</I> styles
that apply to all the windows of a particular class (class being FRAME,
BUTTON, and so on).
<P>
