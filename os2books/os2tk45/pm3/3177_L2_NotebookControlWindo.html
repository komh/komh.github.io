<P>
This system-provided window procedure processes the actions on a notebook
control (WC_NOTEBOOK).
<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
A notebook control (WC_NOTEBOOK window class) is a visual component whose
specific purpose is to organize information on individual pages so that
a user can find and display that information quickly and easily. It simulates
a real-world notebook while improving it by overcoming its natural limitations.
A user can select and display pages by using either a pointing device, such
as a mouse, or the keyboard.
<P>
The notebook is designed to be customizable to meet varying application
requirements, while providing an easy-to-use user interface component that
can be used to develop products that conform to the Common User Access*
(CUA*) user interface guidelines. The application can specify different
colors, sizes, and orientations for its notebooks, and whether the notebook
should be the old or new style, but the underlying function of the control
remains the same.
