<P>
A deactivation message (that is, a WM_ACTIVATE message with<I> usactive
</I>set to FALSE) is sent first to the window procedure of the main window
being deactivated, before an activation message (that is, a WM_ACTIVATE
message with<I> usactive</I> set to TRUE) is sent to the window procedure
of the main window being activated.
<P>
Any <A HREF="4839_L3_WM_SETFOCUS.html">WM_SETFOCUS</A> messages with<I> usfocus
</I>set to FALSE, are sent before the deactivation message. Any <A HREF="4839_L3_WM_SETFOCUS.html">WM_SETFOCUS
</A>messages with<I> usfocus</I> set to TRUE, are sent after the activation
message.
<P>
If<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C4 51 --> WinSetFocus</A> is called during
the processing of a WM_ACTIVATE message, a <A HREF="4839_L3_WM_SETFOCUS.html">WM_SETFOCUS
</A>message with<I> usfocus</I> set to FALSE is not sent, as no window has
the focus.
<P>
If a window is activated before any of its children have the focus, this
message is sent to the frame window or to its FID_CLIENT, if it exists.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Except in the instance of a WM_ACTIVATE message, with<I> usactive
</I>set to TRUE, an application processing a WM_ACTIVATE, or a <A HREF="4839_L3_WM_SETFOCUS.html">WM_SETFOCUS
</A>message should not change the focus window or the active window. If
it does, the focus and active windows must be restored before the window
procedure returns from processing the message. For this reason, any dialog
boxes or windows brought up during the processing of a WM_ACTIVATE, or a
<A HREF="4839_L3_WM_SETFOCUS.html">WM_SETFOCUS</A> message should be system
modal.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
