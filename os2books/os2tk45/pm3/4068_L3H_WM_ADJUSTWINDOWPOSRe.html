<P>
Frame controls can respond to this message to reposition themselves or resize
themselves in the window frame.
<P>
Menu controls respond to this message as follows:
<P>
<B>MS_ACTIONBAR not specified</B>
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> cx</I> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP
</A><I>cy</I> fields are set so that the menu window exactly contains all
of the items in the menu. The<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP
</A><I>x</I> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> y</I> fields
are not changed.
<P>
<B>MS_ACTIONBAR specified and MS_TITLEBUTTON not specified</B>
<P>
The items in the menu are arranged such that all of the items are visible
within the width specified by the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP
</A><I>cx</I> field.  This formatting may cause the menu items to be arranged
in multiple lines. The<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> cx
</I>field is set to include all of the lines of the menu. The<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP
</A><I>x</I> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> y</I> fields
are not changed.
<P>
<B>MS_ACTIONBAR specified and MS_TITLEBUTTON specified</B>
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> cx</I> value is set
to the accumulated width of the items in the menu.  The height specified
in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> cy</I> field is
not changed. In both instances, the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP
</A><I>cx</I> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A><I> cy</I> fields
are only altered if SWP_SIZE is specified in the<I> fl</I> field. Instead,
the width of MS_TITLEBUTTON menus is determined by the accumulated width
of the items in the menu.
<P>
A list box does two things:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Changes the height so as to accommodate an exact number
of items.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Automatically outsets its border.  This means, for
example, that the x, y, width, and height fields in the resource file specify
the working area of the listbox.  The border is drawn outside this area.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The entry field control, if ES_MARGIN is specified, outsets its margin.
This means that in the resource file, the numbers specified as the x-, and
y-position of an entry field control are taken to be the position where
the first character of text is drawn, not where the lower-left corner of
the surrounding box is drawn.  Similarly, the height and width parameters
apply to the editable area of the control; consequently, they do not include
the margin.
<P>
When a dialog is created with<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 8F --> WinCreateDlg
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C4 FC --> WinLoadDlg</A>, a WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS
message is sent to each child window after the dialog window is created,
with a pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 7B --> SWP</A> structure
containing<I> fl</I> equal to SWP_SIZE | SWP_MOVE and the<I> x</I>,<I> y</I>,
<I>cy</I>, and<I> cx</I> fields initialized to the current size and position
of the window. The message enables the control to adjust its size or position,
usually to compensate for its border, or margin, or both.
