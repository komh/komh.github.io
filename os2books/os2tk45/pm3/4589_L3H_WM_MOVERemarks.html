<P>
The message is sent from<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C5 FC --> WinSetWindowPos</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C4 FC -->WinSetMultWindowPos</A>, and<A><!-- external link: 1D E5 C4 FC --> WinScrollWindow</A>.

<P>
The message is sent to any window when it is moved relative to its parent
window.  In addition, a WM_MOVE message is also sent to any children of
that window that have style CS_MOVENOTIFY.
<P>
The new position of the window is obtained by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C4 FC --> WinQueryWindowRect</A>,
and can make those rectangle coordinates relative to any window by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C4 FC -->WinMapWindowPoints</A>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> There are several instances where windows have cause to know
if they have been moved, and these include the occasions when the window
does not change position relative to its parent, but does change position
relative to the screen (its absolute position).
<P>
An example is menus. When a top-level menu control (child of the frame window)
moves its absolute position as a result of the frame window being moved,
the top-level menu control causes the movement of any pull-down menus along
with its movement. The same applies to application/dialog box positional
grouping. In some instances, a dialog box might cause to be moved as the
main window is moved, to make room for other applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
