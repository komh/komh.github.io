<P>
Processing of Notebook control messages in the PM Bidirectional environment
is the same as in the non-bidirectional PM environment. However, the Notebook
control is sensitive to its Bidirectional attributes and handles formatting
and presentation accordingly.
<P>
When the notebook control has right to left window orientation, the page
arrows have their roles reversed: the left arrow turns the pages forward,
whereas the right one turns them backwards. The text of tabs is converted
according to their bidi attributes.
<P>
The WM_SETBIDIATTR dynamicaly modifies the bidi attributes (and as a result
- the appearance) of the notebook control. It will also send appropriate
messages to the user-defined page windows.
