<UL>
<P>
<B>plh</B>  (<A DEPENDENT HREF="164_L2H_LAYOUT_OBJECT.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->LAYOUT_OBJECT</A>)
- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Layout object handle.
<P>
This argument specifies a layout object returned by the LayoutCreateObject
function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> EditType</B>  (<A DEPENDENT HREF="134_L2H_BOOL.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->BOOL</A>)
- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Type of editing.
<P>
The EditType argument specifies the type of edit shaping that is desired.
The following are possible values:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
EditInput<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> When EditType specifies EditInput, it
will read the current code element as defined by index and any preceding
(front) code elements as defined by ShapeContextSize layout value.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> EditReplace
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>When EditType specifies EditReplace, it will read
the current code element as defined by index and any surrounding (front
and/or back) code as defined by ShapeContexSize layout value.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> Note:
the direction of the editing (i.e. layout values - Orientation and TypeOfText
&lt;VISUAL&gt; is what determines which are the preceding and which are
the succeeding code elements.
<P>
When ActiveShapeEditing is set (True) the layout object maintains an "EditInput
state" that may affect subsequent calls to the LayoutEditShape function
with EditInput EditType. The EditInput state is not affected when EditType
is set to EditReplace. To reset the EditInput state to its initial state
these functions should be called with InpBuf set to NULL. The EditInput
state is not affected if any error occurs within the LayoutEditShape is
EditInput.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> index</B>  (<A DEPENDENT HREF="239_L2H_PUCHAR.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->PUCHAR</A>)
- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Cursor position - in bytes units.
<P>
On input the index argument specifies an offset to the start of a code element
in InpBuf that will be the base for the editing. In addition, the context
of surrounding code elements may be considered where the minimum set of
code elements needed for the specific context dependent script(s) is identified
by the ShapeContextSize layout value. If the set of surrounding code elements
as defined by index, InpBuf and InpSize is less then the size of front/back
of the ShapeContextSize, the LayoutEditShape functions will assume there
is no additional context available. It is the caller's responsibility to
provide the minimum context if available. The index argument is in units
associated  with type of InpBuf, i.e. bytes for LayoutEditShape<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> InpBuf
</B> (<A DEPENDENT HREF="242_L2H_PVOID.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->PVOID</A>)
- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Input text.
<P>
The InpBuf argument specifies the source to be processed. A NULL value with
EditInput EditType indicates a request to reset the EditInput state to its
initial state.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> InpSize</B>  (<A DEPENDENT HREF="241_L2H_PULONG.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->PULONG</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Size of InpBuf - number of bytes.
<P>
On input, the InpSize argument specifies the number of code elements to
be processed in units associated with the type , i.e. bytes for LayoutEditShape.
A value of - 1 indicates that input is delimited by a NULL code element.
On return, the value is modified to the actual number of code elements that
needed shaping in InpBuf. A value of zero(0) when EditType is EditInput
indicates that the EditInput state should be reset to its initial state.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>OutBuf</B>  (<A DEPENDENT HREF="242_L2H_PVOID.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->PVOID</A>)
- output<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Output text.
<P>
The OutBuf argument contains the shaped output text. This argument can be
specified as a NULL pointer to indicate that no transformed text is required.
If NULL, the functions will still return the index and InpSize that specify
the amount of text required to be redrawn.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> OutSize
</B> (<A DEPENDENT HREF="241_L2H_PULONG.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->PULONG</A>)
- output<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Size of OutBuf - number of bytes.
<P>
On input, the OutSize argument specifies the size of the output buffer in
number of bytes. Only the code elements required to be shaped are written
into OutBuf. The Output buffer should be large enough to contain the shaped
result; otherwise, only partial shaping will be performed. If the ActiveShapeEditing
layout value is set(True) the OutBuf should be allocated to contain at least:

<P>
number of InpBuf code element
<P>
On return, the OutSize argument is modified to the actual number of bytes
placed in OutBuf.
<P>
When the OutSize argument is specified as zero,the function will calculate
the size of an output buffer large enough to contain the transformed text
from the input buffer, and the result will be returned in this field. The
content of the buffers specifies by InpBuf and OutBuf, and the value of
InpSize, will remain unchanged.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
