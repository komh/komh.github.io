<P>
The clipboard is a mechanism provided by PM to allow the user to transfer
data between different applications. To do so, the user selects some data
in a window, "copies" (or "cuts") it to the clipboard and then "pastes"
the data in the target application.
<P>
When dealing with bidirectional data, it may be required to transfer text
data, that has different bidirectional attributes (i.e, different format
of text) between applications. Accordingly, a conversion of the text must
be performed, in order to transform the text to a format (identified by
bidirectional attributes) which is compatible with the target application
(the one that "pastes" the data).
<P>
The PM bidirectional support provides automatic conversion of text between
source and target applications, based on their process bidirectional attributes.
In addition, bidi-aware applications can explicitly set the bidirectional
attributes managed by the clipboard in order to affect the conversion that
is performed on the text.
<P>
In order to allow the automatic conversion of the clipboard, the following
conditions must be met:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Both the source and the target applications have valid
process bidirectional attributes (i.e, their bidi attributes are not 0).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Exchange of CF_TEXT and CF_DSPTEXT format is performed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The source and target bidi attributes are different.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->None of the applications (i.e, neither the source
application nor the target one) have issued any APIs to cancel the conversion
provided by the clipboard.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The clipboard maintains two sets of bidirectional attributes.
<P>
The first set is called the 'Clipboard Bidirectional Attributes' and is
associated with the text data that is currently stored in the clipboard.
The default value for this set is inherited from the process bidirectional
attributes of the application that issues WinSetClipbrdData. The source
application can optionally modify this set of attributes by using the WinSetLangInfo
API with the LI_BD_CLIP_ATTR effect.
<P>
The second set is called the 'Conversion Bidirectional Attributes'. This
set is associated with the target application, and its default value is
inherited from the process bidirectional attributes of the application that
issues the WinQueryClipbrdData API. The target application can optionally
modify these attributes by using the WinSetLangInfo API with LI_BD_CLIP_CONV_ATTR
effect.
<P>
When using the WinSetLangInfo API to change the clipboard data, bidi-aware
applications must follow the following rules:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Setting of both the 'Clipboard bidi attributes' and
the 'conversion bidi attributes' must be performed only when an application
has access to the clipboard - i.e, after issuing WinOpenClipbrd and before
issuing the WinCloseClipbrd APIs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Setting LI_BD_CLIP_ATTR must be done AFTER data has
been put into the clipboard (that is, after issuing WinSetClipbrdData).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following is a typical scenario. Lines marked with '(BD)' are optional,
and can be issued by bidi-aware applications.
<PRE>  Setting Clipboard Bidirectional Data.  -------------------------------------

  WinOpenClipbrd()
  WinEmptyClipbrd()
  WinSetClipbrdData(CF_TEXT)     (clipboard bidi attributes are set -
                                  inheited from process bidi attributes).

  (BD) WinSetLangInfo(LI_BD_CLIP_ATTR..) (clipboard bidi attribute are set)

  WinCloseClipbrd()


  Querying Clipboard Bidirectional Data
  --------------------------------------

   WinOpenClipbrd()

   (BD) WinQueryLangInfo(LI_BD_CLIP_ATTR...)
                                  (Queries the current clipboard
                                   bidi attributes).
   (BD) WinSetLangInfo(LI_BD_CLIP_CONV_ATTR...)
                                  (sets the clipboard conversion
                                   bidi attributes).
    WinQueryClipbrdData(CF_TEXT)   (clipboard performs conversion on
                                    the text, using the clipboard
                                    and the conversion bidi attributes.
    WinCloseClipbrd()
