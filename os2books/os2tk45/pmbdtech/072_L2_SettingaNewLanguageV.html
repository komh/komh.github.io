<H1>Setting a New Language Viewer</H1><!-- entering slot 72 -->
<P>
An application that wishes to act as a Language Viewer uses the WinSetLangViewer
API. This allows the application to define a window handle that is known
to PM to be the new Language Viewer window. PM supports only one Language
Viewer. That is, when WinSetLangViewer is issued, the window handle that
is referenced becomes the new viewer, and the old viewer does not function
as a viewer anymore.
<P>
When a window acts as a Language Viewer it receives WM_LANGVIEWINFOCHANGED
messages from the system. These messages define the current changes in bidirectional
state that are made to the window that has the focus. Also, PM posts a WM_LANGVIEWINFOCHANGED
message to the Language Viewer window to notify it that it should update
its display, since a new window (probably with a different set of bidi attributes
and keyboard layer) becomes the focus window.
