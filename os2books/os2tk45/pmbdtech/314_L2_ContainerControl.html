<H1>Container Control</H1><!-- entering slot 315 --> 
<P>
Processing of the Container control messages in the PM Bidirectional environment
is the same as in the Non-Bidirectional PM environment. However, the Container
control is sensitive to its Bidirectional attributes and handles formatting
and presentation accordingly.
<P>
The container supports all text Bidi attributes. This support is done in
a hierarchy so that every level (class) of container sub-levels inherits
the container attributes by default. These defaults attributes may be overridden
by a Bidi-Aware application.
<P>
The bidi attributes hierarchy of the container controls works as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The Container Field bidi attributes can be set by sending a CM_SETFIELDBIDIATTR
message to the container. If the field bidi attributes word is not specifially
set by sending the message - the field uses its (parent) record bidi attributes.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Container Record bidi attributes can be set by sending the CM_SETITEMBIDIATTR
message. If the record bidi attributes are not specifically set by sending
the message - the record uses the container window bidi attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The above inheritance chain defines the effective bidi attribute that is
used in processing of a container object.
