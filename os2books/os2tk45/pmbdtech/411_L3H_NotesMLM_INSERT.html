<P>
This message inserts the text string at the currently selected text, visually
deleting that selection. Unlike in the English mode, deletion does not occur
in the same manner as typing at the keyboard would. This is because typing
Arabic in overwrite mode would replace characters in logical order not visual
order.
<P>
The text string must be in CF_TEXT format (or one of the formats acceptable
to <A HREF="406_L3_MLM_IMPORT.html">MLM_IMPORT</A>) and null-terminated.
The line-break (CR LF, LF, and so on) is counted as one byte, regardless
of the number of bytes occupied in the buffer, and the null terminator is
not counted.
<P>
This interacts with the format rectangle and text limits, and a return of
less than the full count can be the result.  If so, a notification message
is sent.
