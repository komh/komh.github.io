<H1>Making an Application Bidi-Aware</H1><!-- entering slot 5 -->
<P>
Most of the applications that are developed today throughout the world are
created as Bidi-unaware applications (with the exception of applications
developed in the countries where the native language is Arabic or Hebrew).
Such applications can be made bidi-aware by adding calls to the PM bidi
support APIs and by adding code that is aware of bidirectional text and
knows how to manage it.
<P>
The PM bidirectional support provides the following types of services/mechanisms
to assist the conversion process of an application to be bidi-aware.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidirectional text presentation
<P>
Support for bidirectional text presentation is available. This support is
sensitive to the contents of the BIDIATTR environment variable.  When this
variable is set, the text output functions do some extra processing to the
text being output. This support provides very basic bidirectional support
for the benefit of bidi-unaware applications.  For applications that use
text in a very simple way (i.e they do not have any sophisticated text handling
features), enabling this support (by initializing the BIDIATTR environment
variable) may be enough.  For this basic support, the application code does
not need be changed at all.  The fact that the unaware application runs
in a bidi-supporting environment (denoted by the BIDIATTR variable) is enough
to trigger the system-provided bidirectional text handling and thus gain
some level of automatic support for such applications.
<P>
In most cases, however, some additional support will be needed. In these
cases, some changes must be made to the application in order to allow it
to support bidi text.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidirectional Input support
<P>
This support allows typing of characters in both English and Hebrew/Arabic,
as well as support for language-specific hotkeys. This is the basic means
that allows the user to input national language text from the keyboard.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidirectional PM Controls.
<P>
PM applications make extensive use of system services called PM Controls.
 These services provide support for many routine tasks such as text entry,
menu management, selections from a list of options and scrolling.
<P>
With the PM Bidirectional support, all PM controls are bidi-aware services.
 Applications can make use of these bidi-aware services by marking them
as bidi-aware and specifying their bidirectional attributes.  This way,
an application can be made aware (up to a certain extent) just by marking
its PM resources as Bidi resources.  In many cases, this process involves
only changes in resource files (.RC) rather than changing source (and executional)
code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidirectional support APIs.
<P>
The third level of support is available only for applications that incorporate
in their code explicit calls to the various PM Bidirectional APIs, such
as calls for text conversions, keyboard input support, justification etc.
