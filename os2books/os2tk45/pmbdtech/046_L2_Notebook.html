<P>
Selecting various BKS_ notebook styles together with setting the window
orientation to right-to-left can be used to construct a notebook which resembles
a right-to-left notebook.
<P>
When the notebook control has RtL window orientation, the page arrows have
their roles reversed: the left arrow turns the pages forwards, whereas the
right one - backwards. The text of Tabs, and Status line is converted according
to their Bidi Attributes.
<P>
For Arabic, mnemonic specified in TABs are normalized to their base shapes.

<P>
The notebook control processes the views of its internal objects (Tabs,
Status-Line and Page-Arrows) according to their bidi attributes. Applications
are responsible for processing the views of their own page components (e.g
dialog controls) by setting the appropriate bidi attributes to these components.

<P>
The internal objects use the bidi attributes of the notebook window, unless
their bidi attributes are specifically set using one of the following messages:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_SETTABTEXTBIDIATTR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_SETSTATUSLINEBIDIATTR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_SETPAGEINFO<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Applications can query the bidi attributes of their tabs and status-line
page components using the following messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_QUERYTABTEXTBIDIATTR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_QUERYSTATUSLINEBIDIATTR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BKM_QUERYPAGEINFO<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When the notebook control receives the WM_SETBIDIATTR message it modifies
its own bidi attributes (and as a result - its appearance).
