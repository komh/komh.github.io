<P>
The default bidirectional attributes word of the presentation space is set
at the time the PS is created by inheriting the process bidirectional attributes
word. 
<P>
 Note that for normal and micro presentation spaces, the process bidirectional
attributes are inherited when the device context is created, so setting
the process bidirectional attribute must be done before the device context
is created in order to affect the presentation space which is associated
with it. 
<P>
This function is used to dynamically change the setting of the bidirectional
attributes of a GPI PS, thus affecting the Bidirectional text conversions
that are performed by GPI.
