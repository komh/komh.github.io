<H1>Container</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
The Container control manages a hierarchy of bidi attributes which resembles
the hierarchy of the container components.
<P>
A container control typically has the following hierarchy:
<PRE>   Container --&gt; Record(s) --&gt;  Field(s)
</PRE>

<P>
Initially, records and fields do not have bidi attributes of their own (their
bidi-attribute are not-initialized). At this time, their effective bidi
attributes are those of the container window.
<P>
Applications can set their container's records or fields bidi attributes
by sending the CM_SETITEMBIDIATTR and CM_SETFIELDBIDIATTR messages..
<P>
They can query their container's records and fields bidi attributes by sending
CM_QUERYTEMBIDIATTR and CM_QUERYFIELDBIDIATTR.
<P>
The bidi-attributes hierarchy of the container works as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A field uses its own bidi attribute (set by CM_SETFIELDBIDIATTR).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If its bidi-attribute has not been initalized (by
sending the CM_SETFIELDBIDIATTR message), a field uses the bidi attribute
of its record.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A record uses it own bidi attribute (set by CM_SETITEMBIDIATTR).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If its bidi-attribute has not been initialized (by
sending the CM_SETITEMBIDIATTR), a field uses the bidi attribute of the
container window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following is the description of the container window messages that are
used to manage bidi attributes:
<PRE>CM_SETITEMBIDIATTR - Set bidi attributes for a specific item (record)
   mp1 - PRECORDCORE pRecordCore
   mp2 - pointer to the following structure.

   typedef struct _BD_ATTR_MASK
         {
         ULONG  ulBD_Attr;
         ULONG  ulBD_Mask;
         } BD_ATTR_MASK;

CM_QUERYITEMBIDIATTR - Queries the bidi attributes of a specific
                       item (record).
   mp1 - PRECORDCORE pRecordCore
   mp2 - PULONG      pBidiAttr - points to a ULONG where BidiAttributes
                                 are returned.

CM_SETFIELDBIDIATTR: - Sets bidi attributes for a specific field (in
                       details view only).

   mp1 - PFIELDINFO pFieldInfo
   mp2 - pointer to the following structure.

   typedef struct _BD_ATTR_MASK
         {
         ULONG  ulBD_Attr;
         ULONG  ulBD_Mask;
         } BD_ATTR_MASK;

CM_QUERYFIELDBIDIATTR - Queries the bidi attributes of a specific field
                        (in details view only).

   mp1: PFIELDINFO pFieldInfo
   mp2: PULONG     pBidiAttr - points to a ULONG where BidiAttributes
                               are returned.
</PRE>

<P>
In general, when the window orientation of the Container is RtL its presentation
and behavior is symmetric to the one used in LtR orientation. Some specific
points are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>First" is considered on the right, "Next" is to
the left. For example, the "First" view in a split details view is on the
right and the "second" is on its left.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Justification of fields is determined by the field
attribute word (CFA_LEFT, CFA_RIGHT). If no justification is specified,
then the default justification is determined according to the effective
bidi attribute of the field (if WND_ORIENT_RTL then default justification
is RIGHT). See more, below, on "effective" bidi attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Vertical scroll-bars are positioned at the left side
of the container and horizontal scrollbars are assigned RtL orientation
(see section on bidi support for scrollbars).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
