<P>
Bidirectional applications use bidirectional text.  The bidirectional text
is identified by the bidirectional attributes.  Since applications use different
sets of bidirectional attributes (and thus, different representations of
bidirectional text), it is necessary to convert this text among representation
forms.  The most common case is when an application converts the text from
the internal (storage) representation to the external (presentation) form.

<P>
OS/2 provides a set of Layout functions to manage the conversion of bidirectional
text between different formats. The text is assumed to be in a form/representation
that is described by a set of input values and is converted to another form
described by a set of output values.
