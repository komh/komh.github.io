<H1>Combination-Box</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
The bidi attributes of the listbox part and the entryfield part of the combination
box are "linked" (i.e changing one of them causes the other to change as
well).
<P>
When the combination box has right-to-left window orientation the listbox
is located beneath and to the left of the entryfield. The left side of the
listbox is aligned with the left side of the entryfield.
