<H1>About the Language Viewer</H1><!-- entering slot 71 -->
<P>
The Language Viewer is a tool which is provided to help the user identify
the current state of the language support, by providing visual indications
that represent the current bidirectional state of the window that has the
focus.
<P>
The default Viewer is implemented as a PM/WorkplaceShell application that
shows a number of icons that represents the current bidirectional attributes
as well as the active keyboard layer of the window that has the PM focus.

<P>
The Viewer is optional. The PM bidirectional support works even if the viewer
application is not active. In addition, the viewer can be replaced by a
user-written application. Such an application can modify the visual effect
that is provided to the user, allowing for more flexibility of the user-interface.
