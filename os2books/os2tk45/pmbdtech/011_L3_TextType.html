<P>
The 'Text Type' bidi attribute defines the method by which text segments
(that have a certain direction) are detected and processed.  The text type
attribute can have the following values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Visual text
<P>
The 'Visual' data type means, that for a certain piece of text there are
no sub-segments.  In other words, the whole text has the same direction
(whether it is LtR or RtL is determined by the Text Orientation attribute,
see below). Whether the text contains digits, English, or Arabic/Hebrew
characters does not change the sequence of the characters within this given
piece of text.
<P>
For example (LTR orientation; upper case letters represent English letters,
while lowercase letters represent Arabic or Hebrew letters):
<PRE>  Index of character: 012345678901
  Storage buffer    : LATIN cibara
  Displayed String  : LATIN cibara

or, in the case of RtL orientation:

  Index of character: 012345
  Storage buffer    : arabic
  Displayed String  : cibara
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Logical text with implicit detection and processing.

<P>
This value is sometimes called "implicit" (for short) or "typing order"
as it usually represents the order of characters as they are typed on the
keyboard.
<P>
Here, the determination of the sub-segments is largely based on the actual
characters in the text.  When there is a doubt (as in the case of characters
which do not have a "strong" language meaning associated with them, such
as SPACE, QUESTION MARK and digits), the determination of the sub-segments
and the conversion required is done by a "smart" algorithm.
<P>
Example (LTR orientation; upper case letters represent Latin letters, while
lowercase letters represents Arabic or Hebrew letters).
<PRE>  Index of character: 012345678901
  Storage buffer    : LATIN hebrew
  Displayed String  : LATIN werbeh
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
