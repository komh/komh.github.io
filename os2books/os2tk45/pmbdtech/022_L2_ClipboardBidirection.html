<P>
The clipboard maintains two sets of bidirectional attributes.
<P>
The first set is called the 'Clipboard Bidirectional Attributes' and is
associated with the text data that is currently stored in the clipboard.
The default value for this set is inherited from the process bidirectional
attributes of the application that issues WinSetClipbrdData. The source
application can optionally modify this set of attributes by using the WinSetLangInfo
API with the LI_BD_CLIP_ATTR effect.
<P>
The second set is called the 'Conversion Bidirectional Attributes'. This
set is associated with the target application, and its default value is
inherited from the process bidirectional attributes of the application that
issues the WinQueryClipbrdData API. The target application can optionally
modify these attributes by using the WinSetLangInfo API with LI_BD_CLIP_CONV_ATTR
effect.
<P>
Refer to the Bidirectional Text Exchange Among Applications - Clipboard
section for more details.
