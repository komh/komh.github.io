<H1>Using BIDIPARAMs in Resource Scripts</H1><!-- entering slot 36 -->
<P>
PM Controls are usually defined in Resource Scripts. Usually, modfiying
resources does not require the application developer to change code in the
application.
<P>
The BIDIPARAM keyword is used to mark PM controls as having specific bidirectional
features (attributes and status). Using the BIDIPARAM keyword in a resource
script allows the application developer to change the definition of a PM
control window, such that when created it behaves "automatically" in a certain
bidirectional manner (e.g, it is formatted "automatically" as a "Right-To-Left"
window, or is initially ready to accept Arabic/Hebrew text).
<P>
BIDIPARAMs are inherited to child windows. For example, specifying BIDIPARAMs
for a dialog window resource, affects all child-windows in that dialog.

<P>
The BIDIPARAM keyword is specified with two parameters. The first one is
the bidi feature that is manipulated (i.e a certain bidirectional attribute,
or a certain bidirectional status flag) and the second parameter is the
value that is given to that feature. In the following example, the dialog
window is marked has having Right-To-Left window orientation. All child
windows inherit this feature, except for the entry field which is specified
has having a Left-To-Right window orientation. In addition the radio button
is marked has having "Implicit" text type.
