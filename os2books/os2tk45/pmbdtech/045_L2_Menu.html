<P>
The menu control processes it items' text according to its bidi attributes.

<P>
When the menu's window orientation is RtL, the Menu control operates in
a symmetric way relative to the behavior of the original (LtR) Menu control.

<P>
In RtL action Bars, the arrow keys behave in a visual way. I.e. The Right-Arrow
key is considered to have a 'Backward' operation and the Left-Arrow key
is considered to have 'Forward' operation.
<P>
The menu supports mnemonics in the "correct" keyboard layer. The menu control
sets the keyboard layer based on the language of the first mnemonic character
defined in the menu. This means, that it is expected that in a certain menu,
the application uses only one language for mnemonic characters.
<P>
For Arabic: All character shapes of any Arabic mnemonic are accepted.
