<H1>WM_KBDLAYERCHANGED Message</H1><!-- entering slot 32 -->
<P>
When the keyboard layer is changed, a WM_KBDLAYERCHANGED is optionally posted
to the window procedure that has keyboard focus, to notify it about the
keyboard layer change. This lets the window procedure take the appropriate
action (such as updating its internal variables and/or updating some status
display).
<P>
The message is sent only when the WinSetKbdLayer API is specifically instructed
to do so by specifying the SKLF_SENDMSG flag.
