<H1>Text Orientation</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
This attribute defines the orientation of a text string (object). It may
have the following values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Left-To-Right<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Right-To-Left<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Contextual<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For text that has the Visual data type, the text orientation determines
the order of the characters.  For example, when visual text has Left-To-Right
orientation, the order of the characters in the memory buffer and the presentation
order (from left-to-right) is the same.
<P>
For text that has the Logical/Implicit data type, the text orientation of
a certain piece of text defines which type of characters are considered
the "base" text. The characters which belong to the "base" text retain their
sequence when converting from storage to presentation or vice versa, while
the characters which belong to embedded segments ("non base" text) are reversed.

<P>
For LtR text, Latin text retains its order while Arabic/Hebrew text is reordered
(reversed).
<P>
For RtL text, Arabic/Hebrew text retains its order while Latin text is reordered
(reversed).
<P>
Contextual text orientation is not exactly an orientation value (obviously,
orientation can be only LtR or RtL).  The contextual text orientation value
tells the system that the actual orientation of the given text should be
determined based on the first "strong" character in the text (in storage
buffer indexes).  I.e, if the first character in the buffer is an English
character, the orientation of the text will be Left-To-Right.  If the first
character in the buffer is Arabic/Hebrew  - the text orientation is Right-To-Left.(
