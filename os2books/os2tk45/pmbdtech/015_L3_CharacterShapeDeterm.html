<P>
Arabic is a cursive script.  This means that the presentation of each letter
depends on its location in the word (initial, middle, final or isolated).

<P>
Data may be stored "shaped", i.e. each letter of the text is stored in the
specific codepoint (out of the different possible codepoints for that letter)
that suits its position in the word and the connecting capabilities of its
adjacent letters. Such data can be displayed directly.
<P>
Data may also be stored in nominal or base shapes, i.e. one codepoint per
letter, regardless of its position.  Such data must be "shaped" before it
is displayed.
<P>
The text shape attribute defines how the Arabic text is stored and also
what type of conversion should be performed on it in order to display it
correctly. It can take the following values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->TEXT_DISPLAY_SHAPED
<P>
This implies that the text is stored in nominal/base shapes and should be
automatically shaped upon display.
<P>
PM entryfields that have this attribute automatically shape new text as
it is being entered by the user and will submit the text in nominal shapes
upon query.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->TEXT_SHAPE_NOMINAL
<P>
This implies that the text is displayed and stored in its nominal (base)
shapes.
<P>
This text shape is not commonly used.
<P>

<P>
The following shaping modes are valid only when the type of text is visual:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->TEXT_SAVE_SHAPED
<P>
This implies that text is already shaped and ready for display.
<P>
PM entryfields that have this attribute automatically shape new text as
it is being entered by the user and will submit the text as it appears on
the screen upon query.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->TEXT_SHAPE_INITIAL
<P>
This implies that text is already shaped and ready for display.
<P>
PM entryfields that are set to this mode shape new characters typed by the
user in initial shapes and will submit the text as it appears on the screen
upon query.
<P>
This mode is usually initiated with a hotkey by users who need to type some
characters specifically in their initial shapes.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->TEXT_SHAPE_MIDDLE
<P>
This implies that text is already shaped and ready for display.
<P>
PM entryfields that are set to this mode shape new characters typed by the
user in middle shapes and will submit the text as it appears on the screen
upon query.
<P>
This mode is usually initiated with a hotkey by users who need to type some
characters specifically in their middle shapes.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->TEXT_SHAPE_FINAL
<P>
This implies that text is already shaped and ready for display.
<P>
PM entryfields that are set to this mode shape new characters typed by the
user in final shapes and will submit the text as it appears on the screen
upon query.
<P>
This mode is usually initiated with a hotkey by users who need to type some
characters specifically in their final shapes.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->TEXT_SHAPE_ISOLATED
<P>
This implies that text is already shaped and ready for display.
<P>
PM entryfields that are set to this mode shape new characters typed by the
user in isolated shapes and will submit the text as it appears on the screen
upon query.
<P>
This mode is usually initiated with a hotkey by users who need to type some
characters specifically in their isolated shapes.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
