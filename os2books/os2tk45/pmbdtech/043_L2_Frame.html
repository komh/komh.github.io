<H1>Frame</H1><!-- entering slot 43 -->
<P>
When the frame control has right-to-left window orientation, the position
of its controls is symmetric to the position in left-to-right orientation,
except for the system-menu, and min-max controls that stay at the same position.

<P>
The frame responds to the WM_SETBIDIATTR message by re-positioning of its
controls. It also sends the message to the client window.
