<P>
This section describes the data types that are used in the Bidi functions.
These are in the C language.  For a description of a particular data type,
select the + on the Contents to view a list of data types, then select the
data type from that list.
<P>
<B>Implicit Pointer Data Types</B>
<P>
 Data type names beginning with "P" (for example, PERRORCODE) is likely
to be a pointer to another data type (in this instance, ERRORCODE).
<P>
In the data type summary, (provided by selecting the + in front of Data
Types on the Contents), no explicit "typedefs" are shown for pointers. Therefore,
if no data type definition can be found in the summary for a data type name
"Pxxxxxx", it becomes a pointer to the data type "xxxxxx", for which a definition
should be found in the summary.
<P>
The implicit type definition needed for such a pointer "Pxxxxxx" is:
<PRE>typedef xxxxxx *Pxxxxxx;
</PRE>

<P>
Such definitions are provided by means of the system header file OS2.H.

<P>
<B>Storage Mapping of Data Types</B>
<P>
The storage mapping of the data types is dependent on the machine architecture.
 To be portable, applications must access the data types using the definitions
supplied for that environment.
