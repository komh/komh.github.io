<P>
The Arabic and the Hebrew codepages are bilingual (i.e. they contain English
and Arabic or English and Hebrew characters). When either of these codepages
is active, the system fonts support all the characters in the relevant codepage.
This means that the system fonts are bilingual, for example "Courier" would
contain both English and Arabic/Hebrew. shapes.
<P>
This means that applications do not need to change fonts when switching
between Arabic/Hebrew and English characters.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Arabic and Hebrew postscript (Adobe Type 1) fonts are created
using font specific encoding. This means that the value used for the codepage
of these fonts is "65400" rather than the national codepage. Applications
that specify the usCodepage field when creating a logical font should use
this value in order to get a match for the Bidi postscript fonts.
