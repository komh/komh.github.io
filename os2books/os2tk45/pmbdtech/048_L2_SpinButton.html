<P>
The entryfield part of the Spin Button control inherits the same bidi attributes
as those of the Spin Button window. It behaves in the same way as the 'normal'
entry field.
<P>
When the SpinButton control has RtL window orientation, the location of
the "arrow-window" is on the left side of the window.
