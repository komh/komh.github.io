<P>
The "Window Orientation" bidi attribute is unique among all other bidi attributes,
as it defines a property of a WINDOW (rather than a property of the text
being processed). The window orientation attribute is "packaged" in the
bidi attribute word for convenience, since it is a very handy placeholder
for bidi-oriented information.
<P>
The Window Orientation attribute covers several visual aspects of a window.
 These include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><I>Layout</B></I>
<P>
In the Window Orientation context, layout refers to the positioning of objects
within a window or dialog.
<P>
A window with a LtR window orientation has its origin at the bottom left.

<P>
A window with a RtL window orientation has its origin at the bottom right
of the window instead of the bottom left, thus placement of objects (e.g.
child windows, controls, vertical scrollbar, etc.) within the window will
be in the symmetrically opposite position to those in a LtR window.
<P>
Some examples of how this works:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->RtL Buttons have their text positioned to the left
of the 'button bitmap'.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->RtL Horizontal scrollbars have their origin on the
right.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Vertical scrollbars in listboxes, MLEs, etc. are
placed on the left side of the window.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->This concept is applied in the same way to other
objects in the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><I>Justification
</B></I>
<P>
In many cases the default justification of objects within a Right-To-Left
object is on the right.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In general, a window with RtL window orientation has Right-To-Left layout
and its objects are right-justified.
