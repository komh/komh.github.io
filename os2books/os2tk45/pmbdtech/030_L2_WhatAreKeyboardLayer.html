<H1>What Are Keyboard Layers?</H1><!-- entering slot 30 -->
<P>
On keyboards used for bidirectional languages, two characters (a Latin one
and a "National Language" one) are engraved on each key and the user can
select which of these characters is used, by selecting the active keyboard
language (or "Keyboard Layer").
<P>
Changing the keyboard layer can be done by the user pressing one of the
"Layer Change" hotkeys, or by an application issuing the WinSetKbdLayer
API. In this way, the same physical keyboard is used to input text in both
languages.
<P>
CUA guidelines define the "keyboard layer change" hotkeys as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select Latin/English layer - Alt+Left Shift.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select National Language layer (Arabic/Hebrew) - Alt+Right
Shift.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
