<P>
All standard dialogs (File dialog, Font dialog and the Messagebox) support
a Right-To-Left/NLS mode. In this mode, their standard text is in the national
language  and the general orientation of the dialog is right-to-left. Standard
dialogs can be made to work in this mode as a result of an application interface
(specific for each standard dialog) or when the the environment variable
STDDLGLANG is set to 'NATIONAL'. The following is a description of the Right-To-Left/NLS
mode of each of the standard dialogs:
