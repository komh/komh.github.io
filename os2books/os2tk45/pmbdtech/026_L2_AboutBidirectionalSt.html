<H1>About Bidirectional Status</H1><!-- entering slot 26 -->
<P>
Every window in the system maintains its bidirectional status.
<P>
Bidirectional status flags are used to represent configuration information
that tells the system how to handle various events for the window. The status
flags include information that defines how bidirectional language hotkeys
should be handled and its current typing mode.
<P>
The bidirectional status is saved by the system for each window and it can
be set and queried by applications using the WinSetLangInfo API.
