<H1>Bidirectional Text Conversions</H1><!-- entering slot 749 -->
<P>
OS/2 provides a set of functions to manage the conversion of bidirectional
text between different formats. The text is assumed to be in a form/representation
that is described by a set of input values and is converted to another form
described by a set of output values.
<P>
In order to perform a text conversion, the caller must first call LayoutCreateObject
to create a layout object. The layout object is automatically associated
with a set of default values, known as layout values, that depend on the
locale used to create it.
<P>
Currently, the following locale is supported:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Locale_Arabic<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Locale_Hebrew<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Using the handle to the layout object created, the caller can query the
current values using LayoutQueryValues and set them, using LayoutSetValues,
to the values required for the text transformation.
<P>
The section <A DEPENDENT HREF="749_L2_LayoutValues.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->Layout
Values</A> describes the standard set of layout values that are supported.
It also describes which layout values may be changed after creation of the
layout object. 
<P>
The actual text transformation is done by the LayoutTransformText function,
which converts its input buffer according to the values associated with
the layout object. LayoutTransformText can also optionally provide some
additional information about the transformation performed, such as mappings
of the input buffer to the output buffer.
<P>
LayoutEditShape is a more specialized text conversion function that allows
an application to do Arabic character shape editing in and around a specific
location in a buffer.
<P>
When an application has finished its text conversions, it can release the
resources used by the layout object using LayoutDestroyObject.
