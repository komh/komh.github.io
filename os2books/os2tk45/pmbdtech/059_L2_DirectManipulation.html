<P>
There is no specific bidirectional support implemented in the system support
for Direct Manipulation.
<P>
Bidi-Aware applications that add their own type of 'direct manipulation
mechanism' (such as a spreadsheet program externalizing its drag &amp; drop
mechanism, so that another application can interface with it), must publish,
as part of their interface specification, the bidi attributes, so that other
applications, which may use different types of text, can do the necessary
bidi text conversion, if required.
