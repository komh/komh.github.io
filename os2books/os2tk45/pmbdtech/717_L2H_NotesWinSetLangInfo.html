<P>
The interpertation of the parameters is dependent on the value of ulEffect.
This function is considered "window related" when ulEffect is LI_BD_WND_ATTR
or LI_BD_WND_STAT.
<P>
When ulEffect is not window related then the value of hwnd must be NULL
and the ulMask value is ignored (ie no mask is used, the value provided
in ulData is used to set the information).
<P>
When ulEffect is window related, the function optionally sends a WM_SETBIDIATTR
or WM_SETBIDISTAT message to the window procedure whose information is being
set. The window procedure can set the bidi information by itself, and/or
perform any additional processing that is required when its bidirectional
information is set. When LIF_NO_SENDMSG flag is specified no window message
is sent by the function. This can be used by the window procedure itself
when it updates its own window-related bidirectional information (so that
it does not receive a recursive message).
<P>
It is recommended that the LIF_NO_SENDMSG flag is not turned on when the
function is called from outside the window procedure whose attributes are
being set. Applications should generaly use the default (send the message
to the window procedure), so that the bidi aware window procedures can take
the appropriate actions when the request to change their bidi attributes
is made.
<P>
There may be cases where the LIF_WND_REFRESH and/or the LIF_CHILD_INHERIT
flags are ignored. This can happen when a window procedure processes any
of the messages sent by this function (i.e when the LIF_NO_SENDMSG flag
is not specified). In these cases, it is up to the window procedure code
to determine whether a redraw operation is requiered and whether child windows
should process the message or not. 
<P>
It is recommended that the LIF_NO_SENDMSG flag is NOT turned on, when the
code executes outside the window procedure whose attributes are set.
<P>
Applications should generally use the default (send the messege to the window
procedure), so that Bidi-aware window procedures can take the appropriate
actions when the request to change their Bidi attributes/status is made.
