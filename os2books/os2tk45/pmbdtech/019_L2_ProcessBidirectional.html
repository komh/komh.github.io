<H1>Process Bidirectional Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
Process bidirectional attributes are used to assign applications a default
set of attributes.  These attributes are used by various PM components to
determine the processing that must take place.
<P>
In this version, the Process bidirectional attributes are determined based
on value of the "BIDIATTR" OS/2 environment variable which is in effect
at the time the program is loaded into memory. The BIDIATTR environment
variable can have multiple values that represent bidirectional attributes.
For example:
<PRE>SET BIDIATTR=TEXT_ORIENT_RTL,TEXTTYPE_VISUAL,TEXT_SAVE_SHAPED
</PRE>

<P>
The names of the various bidirectional attributes are documented in Appendix
D.
<P>
Applications can set the process bidirectional attributes by using the WinSetLangInfo
API, with the parameter LI_BD_PROCESS_ATTR.
