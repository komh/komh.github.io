<H1>Scope of Bidirectional Support</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
The PM bidirectional support has been designed with the following main design
objectives:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allow creation of bidi-aware applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allow as easy as possible conversion of bidi-unaware
applications to being bidi-aware.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allow usage of bidi-unaware applications in the National
Language. The extent to which this is possible is largely dependent on the
application itself.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Thus, the full bidirectional support is provided to applications which make
active use of the PM Bidirectional services (APIs, PM messages etc). In
addition, a certain degree of support is also provided for bidi-unaware
applications. Depending on the application, this support (for bidi-unaware)
may provide various degrees of usability for the application when working
with Arabic or Hebrew.
<P>
The Bidirectional support in PM is provided in the Arabic and Hebrew language
versions of OS/2. The support is active/configured when the COUNTRY selection
during OS/2 installation is Arabic or Hebrew in these versions.
