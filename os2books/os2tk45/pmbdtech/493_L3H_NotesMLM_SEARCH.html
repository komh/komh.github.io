<H1>Notes - MLM_SEARCH</H1><!-- entering slot 494 -->
<P>
This message searches the MLE text for a specified string, starting at a
specified insertion point and continuing until the second specified insertion
point has been reached, or the requested string has been matched.
<P>
When an <A HREF="490_L3_MLM_SEARCH.html">MLM_SEARCH</A> message is sent,
the text is scanned starting with the character that follows the insertion
point indicated in the<B> iptStart</B> field of the <A HREF="217_L2H_MLE_SEARCHDATA.html">MLE_SEARCHDATA
</A>structure.  The search proceeds until the point indicated in the<B> iptStop
</B>field, until a match is found, or until TRUE is returned from MLN_SEARCHPAUSE
notification (see<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 27 FC --> WM_CONTROL (in Multiline
Entry Fields)</A>). If a negative value is specified for the<B> iptStart</B>,
the current cursor point is used.  If a negative value is specified for
<B>iptStop</B>, the end of the text is used.  If<B> iptStop</B>, is less
than or equal to<B> iptStart</B>, after performing the two indicated substitutions,
the search wraps from the end of the text to the beginning of the text.

<P>
If the MLFSEARCH_CASESENSITIVE option is specified, the bytes of the search
string must exactly match those in the text.  If MLFSEARCH_CASESENSITIVE
is not specified, the<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 27 B2 --> WinUpperChar
</A>of the search string must match the<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 27 B2 --> WinUpperChar
</A>of the text.
<P>
When a match is found, the<B> iptStart</B> field of the search specification
structure is set to indicate the insertion point immediately preceding the
first character of the match, and the<B> cchFind</B> field is set to indicate
the number of characters in the match.  The cursor selection is not altered
unless MLFSEARCH_SELECTMATCH is specified.  If it is, an <A HREF="510_L3_MLM_SETSEL.html">MLM_SETSEL
</A>is done with the anchor point at<B> iptStart</B> and the cursor at<B> iptStart
</B>+<B> cchFind</B>.
<P>
While searching, the MLE occasionally sends an MLN_SEARCHPAUSE notification
message.  If the owner responds to this message with the value TRUE, the
MLE stops the search. When a search is stopped from MLN_SEARCHPAUSE,<B> iptStart
</B>is set to the point where the search terminated. If the response is
FALSE, the search continues (see also the definition of MLN_SEARCHPAUSE).
The interval at which MLN_SEARCHPAUSE notifications are sent is implementation-dependent,
but must not exceed reasonable user-response thresholds, nor should it be
so often as to introduce undue messaging overhead. Sending this notification
every half second is a reasonable compromise.
<P>
When no match is found the<B> iptStart</B> value is unchanged.
<P>
If the application needs to continue the search, the proper way is to change
the<B> iptStart</B> value to be the point following the string found, adjusting
for any text changes done after the search that may have moved the relative
location of the point.
<P>
Applications using this message are advised to change the system pointer
to the wait icon (clock face) if it is expected that the search will take
some time.
