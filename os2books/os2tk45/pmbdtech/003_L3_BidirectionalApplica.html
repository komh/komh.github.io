<P>
Bidirectional applications are applications that support the Arabic and
Hebrew languages. By nature, bidirectional applications have to be sensitive,
to some extent, to the fact that their text data is bidirectional (contains
embedded LtR and RtL segments).
<P>
In this context there are two types of applications:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidi-Aware Applications
<P>
These applications are written specifically to be used by Arabic and Hebrew-speaking
users.  These applications are aware of the fact that the text being processed
is bidirectional, and take steps to ensure the correct processing of this
text. Bidi-aware applications make active use of the PM bidirectional support
APIs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Bidi-Unaware Applications
<P>
Bidi-Unaware applications do not have any knowledge about the fact that
the text they handle/process is bidirectional. Usually, these applications
are developed for users of a Left-To-Right language (such as English or
French), and thus they do not perform any special handling of bidirectional
text. Such applications do not make explicit calls to the PM APIs for bidirectional
support.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
