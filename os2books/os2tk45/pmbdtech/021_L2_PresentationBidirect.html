<P>
These bidirectional attributes are associated with text output operations.
 The text output APIs in PM (WinDrawText and the various GpiCharString APIs)
are sensitive to the presentation bidirectional attributes.  These attributes
are inherited from the process bidirectional attributes at creation time
of each GPI presentation space.
<P>
The text-output APIs use the presentation bidi attributes to determine the
conversions that must be applied to the text as part of the processing of
the text-output APIs.  For example, GpiCharString will convert bidirectional
text, by calling the LayoutTransformText API on behalf of the application
program.  The bidi-converted string will then be rendered on the the output
device (rather than the original string that has been provided in GpiCharString
API call).
<P>
Applications can optionally modify the presentation bidi attributes dynamically
by using the GpiSetBidiAttr API. Thus, applications have control on the
text conversion that are executed on a call by call basis.
