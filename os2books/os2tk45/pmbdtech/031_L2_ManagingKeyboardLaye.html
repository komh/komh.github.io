<H1>Managing Keyboard Layers Using WinSetKbdLayer</H1><!-- entering slot 31 -->
<P>
Keyboard layers are set and queried by the WinSetKbdLayer and the WinQueryKbdLayer
APIs. These APIs are provided so that applications can set the keyboard
to produce characters in the language that is required by the application
for a specified window (or text input field). Issuing a WinSetKbdLayer API
by an application is equivalent to pressing a "Layer Change" hotkey by the
user.
