<H1>Using WinSetLangInfo to Send WM_SETBIDISTAT Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 28 -->
<P>
The WM_SETBIDISTAT message is optionally sent to a window procedure every
time a window bidirectional status word is set. Likewise, the WM_QUERYBIDISTAT
can be sent when the status is queried. This lets a bidi-aware window procedure
 know that its status is being change and to take the appropriate action,
if required. In general, these messages are sent and processed in the same
way as the WM_SETBIDIATTR and WM_QUERYBIDIATTR message, as described in
the "Sending WM_SETBIDIATTR messages in WinSetLangInfo API".
