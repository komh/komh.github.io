<H1>Runtime Support for Bidirectional Help Documents</H1><!-- entering slot 66 -->
<P>
The runtime support for Bidirectional help documents (both .inf and .hlp
files) is active only for documents that were compiled with IPFCBIDI using
/L=ARA or /L=HEB. Such documents will be referred to as "Bidi documents."

<P>
Documents compiled with the non-bidi ipfc compiler and documents compiled
with IPFCBIDI and any non-bidi language will not be affected by the Bidi
runtime support.
