<P>
The object handle returned from this method is the same handle that can
either be used for the WinCreateObject, WinSetObjectData or WinDestroyObject.
The handle is unique on a given machine so the returned object handle can
be passed to other processes or stored for later use (even across IPLs of
the system). For more information about WinCreateObject, WinSetObjectData,
and WinDestroyObject, see the<I><I> Presentation Manager Programming Reference</I>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is recommended that wpQueryHandle be used sparingly on
file-based object classes because the operating system keeps track of the
current location of every file object that has been allocated an object
handle. Performance could be adversely affected if object handles are obtained
for every file-system object that was ever awakened.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
