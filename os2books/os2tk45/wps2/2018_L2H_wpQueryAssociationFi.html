<P>
The association filter is used to designate this program as an available
open view for data file objects that have a title that matches one of the
association filters which are set. If a data file object matches a filter
in a program object or program file object, the title of the program object
or program file object will appear in the data file object's Open cascade
of its pop-up menu. The <A HREF="2023_L2_wpQueryAssociationFi.html">wpQueryAssociationFilter
</A>method will return the filter string set by the last call to the <A HREF="3469_L2_wpSetAssociationFilt.html">wpSetAssociationFilter
</A>method. The <A HREF="2043_L2_wpQueryAssociationTy.html">wpQueryAssociationType
</A>method can be called to determine which file types are used to associate
data file objects to this program object.
