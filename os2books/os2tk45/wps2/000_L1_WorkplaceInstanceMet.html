<H1>Workplace Instance Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->This chapter contains an alphabetic listing of the
Workplace instance methods. Instance methods are methods that are valid
for a specific object.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In scanning the header files, you may find the names of Workplace
methods that are not documented in this material. There are several places
this might happen: in Class Data Structures, Class Method Tables, or Release
Order Lists. Methods that are listed in one of these locations, but not
documented, are private methods. They are exposed in header files due to
the way the SOM compiler generates the header files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
