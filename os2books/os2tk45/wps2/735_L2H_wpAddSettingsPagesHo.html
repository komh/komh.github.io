<H1>wpAddSettingsPages - How to Override</H1><!-- entering slot 735 -->
<P>
This method is always overridden in order to add pages to or remove pages
from the Settings notebook. To add a page to the Settings notebook, a call
to <A HREF="1616_L2_wpInsertSettingsPage.html">wpInsertSettingsPage</A> is
required. To remove a page from the Settings notebook, the method that adds
the page to the Settings notebook must be overridden and SETTINGS_PAGE_REMOVED
is returned without calling its parent method.
<P>
When adding a page, the parent method should usually be called first. Calling
the parent method first will put pages added by the overriding method at
the top of the Settings notebook, above the pages added by ancestor classes.
Calling the parent last will put pages added by the overriding at the bottom
of the Settings notebook, below the pages added by ancestor classes.
