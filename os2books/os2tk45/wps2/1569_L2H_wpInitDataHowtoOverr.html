<P>
Any class that has instance variables should override this method so that
those variables are all initially in a known state. It is essential to pass
this method onto the parent class before doing your own processing. If this
method is overridden, <A HREF="4460_L2_wpUnInitData.html">wpUnInitData</A> should
also be overridden in order to de-allocate resources that were allocated
by the override processing of wpInitData.
