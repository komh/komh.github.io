<P>
This method is invoked by a Workplace Shell class each time a wpSetXXX method
is used.  It is recommended that wpSaveDeferred be used in most cases.  The
only exception is if the state data has changed in some critical way.  For
example, if the object wanted to save a new password, it would use <A HREF="3353_L2_wpSaveImmediate.html">wpSaveImmediate
</A>instead of wpSaveDeferred to guarantee that the password is saved before
continuing.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> wpSaveDeferred can be called only after an object has been
initialized. This method can be called from within <A HREF="1850_L2_wpObjectReady.html">wpObjectReady
</A>but not from <A HREF="3289_L2_wpRestoreState.html">wpRestoreState</A>.
To determine if an object is initialized, use <A HREF="1671_L2_wpIsObjectInitialize.html">wpIsObjectInitialized</A>.
