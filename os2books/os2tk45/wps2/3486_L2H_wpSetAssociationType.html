<P>
The association type is used to designate this program as an available open
view for data file objects that have a type that matches one of the association
types which are set. If a data file object matches a type in a program object
or program file object, the title of the program object or program file
object appears in the data file object's Open cascade of its pop-up menu.
A call to the <A HREF="3491_L2_wpSetAssociationType.html">wpSetAssociationType
</A>method causes the existing association types for this object to be replaced.
To determine the existing association types that are set on this object,
a call to the <A HREF="2043_L2_wpQueryAssociationTy.html">wpQueryAssociationType
</A>method can be made. The <A HREF="3469_L2_wpSetAssociationFilt.html">wpSetAssociationFilter
</A>method can be called to set an association based on the title of the
data file object.
