<P>
This method can be called at any time to decrement the object's lock count.

<P>
This method is used in conjunction with other methods that create new instances
of objects.  If these methods are called with the fLock flag set to TRUE,
the new object is locked into the awake state until the wpUnlockObject method
is called.
