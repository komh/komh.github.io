<P>
This method should be overridden in order to process class-specific open
views. This method can also be overridden in order to modify the behavior
defined by an ancestor class. When wpOpen is overridden to implement a user-defined
view, it should call wpAddToObjUseList and wpRegisterView to ensure that
the new view is registered by the Workplace Shell as a view of the object.
