<P>
The association filter is used to designate this program as an available
open view for data file objects that have a title that matches one of the
association filters which are set. If a data file object matches a filter
in a program object or program file object, the title of the program object
or program file object appears in the data file object's Open cascade of
its pop-up menu. A call to the <A HREF="3469_L2_wpSetAssociationFilt.html">wpSetAssociationFilter
</A>method causes the existing association filters for this object to be
replaced.  To determine the existing association filters that are set on
this object, a call to the <A HREF="2023_L2_wpQueryAssociationFi.html">wpQueryAssociationFilter
</A>method can be made. The <A HREF="3491_L2_wpSetAssociationType.html">wpSetAssociationType
</A>method can be called to set an association based on the type of data
file object.
