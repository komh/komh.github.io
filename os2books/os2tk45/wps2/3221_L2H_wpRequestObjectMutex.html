<P>

<P>
The Workplace Shell calls the wpRequestObjectMutexSem method to stop other
threads from modifying an object while it is updating it.  For example,
when the Workplace Shell is enumerating the objects within a folder, it
calls the wpRequestObjectMutexSem method for the folder to stop new objects
from being added to the folder or old objects from being removed from the
folder.
<P>
Each object has associated with it a mutex semaphore that can be used to
serialize access to resources.  This method is called to assert that the
current thread indeed holds this mutex semaphore.  Methods that expect to
be invoked under semaphore protection can use this method to validate that
the caller has indeed obtained ownership of the mutex semaphore.
<P>
This semaphore is used primarily to control access to the linked list of
use items, but can be used for other purposes if needed.  Folders also have
a separate mutex semaphore, which is used to protect the content chain for
that folder.
<P>
If you need both the object and the folder mutex semaphores, then you must
obtain the folder mutex first.
<P>
If you need multiple object mutex semaphores, obtain them in object address
order.
<P>
As with most semaphores, hold the semaphore for the minimum possible time.
