<P>
 OS/2 maintains a list of all open folders in the system. wpQueryOpenFolders
provides access to this list.
<P>
The first time you call wpQueryOpenFolders specify QC_FIRST in<I> ulOption</I>.
A pointer to the first open folder in the open folder list is returned in
<I>Object</I>. On subsequent calls specify QC_NEXT in<I> ulOption</I> and
the pointer to the previously returned folder in<I> Object</I>. A pointer
to the next folder in the open folder list is returned. wpQueryOpenFolders
returns NULL after the last folder in the list has been returned.
<P>
wpQueryOpenFolders returns the next open folder after the folder passed
in<I> Object</I>, or a NULL if the folder passed in<I> Object</I> is the
last folder in the open folder list.
<P>
If wpQueryOpenFolders is called with QC_NEXT in<I> ulOption</I> and a pointer
to a closed folder in<I> Object</I> then a QC_FIRST operation is performed.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Do not close the open views of a folder returned by the wpQueryOpenFolders
method because this breaks the chain of open folders.  If you close the
last open view of a folder, the next call to wpQueryOpenFolders will return
NULL, even though there are other open folders in the system.
