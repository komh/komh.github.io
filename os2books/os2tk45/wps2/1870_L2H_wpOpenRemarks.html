<P>
In general, <A HREF="4488_L2_wpViewObject.html">wpViewObject</A> should
be used instead of this method because wpViewObject takes into consideration
the setting in the Object Open Behavior field on the Window page of the
Settings notebook for the object. If a view of the object is already open,
wpViewObject will, depending on the setting of the Object Open Behavior
field, either display the existing window for the object or create a new
object.
<P>
In contrast, wpOpen<I> always</I> opens a new view of the object. Under
certain circumstances this might be called for; however, under most circumstances,
wpViewObject should be called instead.
