<P>
If ulSearchType is SEARCH_ALL_FOLDERS then pszName is used to build up a
new name of the form *:\pszName. Each valid drive letter is then substituted
in for the *, and the search is performed as described below.
<P>
Beginning at the root directory, search for folder matches at the name level.
 For the example C:\Folder1\Folder2\*, search the C: folder for all occurrences
of Folder objects with the descriptive name Folder1.  Then search those
for all Folder objects of descriptive name Folder2.
<P>
Then within Folder2 search for all objects that are descended from the classes
listed in the pInfo structures passed in and see if the descriptive name
matches.  If a match is found, consult the pInfo structure again to determine
if the fSkipExtendedSearchCriteria flag is set.  If the flag is not set,
add the object to the result folder.  If the flag is set, do an extended
criteria match.  If it matches, add the object to the results folder.  If
there are subfolders to be searched, recurse down into the subfolders to
continue the search.
<P>
All matches are placed in the result folder as a link to the matched item.
