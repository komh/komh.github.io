<P>
The association type is used to designate this program as an available open
view for data file objects which have a type that matches one of the association
types which are set. If a data file object matches a type in a program object
or program file object, the title of the program object or program file
object will appear in the data file object's Open cascade of its pop-up
menu. The wpQueryAssociationType method will return the type string set
by the last call to the <A HREF="3491_L2_wpSetAssociationType.html">wpSetAssociationType
</A>method. The <A HREF="2023_L2_wpQueryAssociationFi.html">wpQueryAssociationFilter
</A>method can be called to determine which file title filters are used
to associate data file objects to this program object.
