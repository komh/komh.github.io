<P>
When the specified views appear to have finished closing on the Desktop
it might seems that the method is hung. This is because closing the multithreading
process may require additional time to complete.
<P>
If a view is in the process of closing, and you must wait for that view
to finish closing before you can continue processing, this method can be
called to act as an event semaphore. It can also be used to block the thread
until a program exits when executed from a program object.
