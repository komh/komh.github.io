<P>
This method is useful in other methods whose processing may differ depending
on whether the object is in the process of being created or has completed
creation. Setting the object's state to initialized is one of the final
steps of object creation during move, copy, and create operations.
<P>
Certain methods, such as <A HREF="3342_L2_wpSaveDeferred.html">wpSaveDeferred
</A>and <A HREF="3353_L2_wpSaveImmediate.html">wpSaveImmediate</A>, are
only valid on initialized objects.
<P>
wpIsObjectInitialized can be used within <A HREF="4362_L2_wpSetup.html">wpSetup
</A>to determine if <A HREF="4362_L2_wpSetup.html">wpSetup</A> is being
called during object creation (wpIsObjectInitialized returns FALSE) or after
the object has been created, for example from WinSetObjectData (wpIsObjectInitialized
returns TRUE).
