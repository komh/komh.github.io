<P>
This routine is called by the system when the object is created or when
it is awakened from the dormant state so that it can initialize all of its
instance variables to a known state. By default, memory allocated to instance
variables is zerofilled. Note that this method is called before the object's
state is known, so it is very important that the object does not try to
process any other method while processing this method. Should an object
need extra initialization that requires it to invoke other methods, this
should be done from <A HREF="3289_L2_wpRestoreState.html">wpRestoreState</A>.

<P>
When the object is first created, <A HREF="4386_L2_wpSetupOnce.html">wpSetupOnce
</A>should be overridden to perform initialization that is required only
once.
<P>
The parent method must be called before any processing is done by your overriding
method.
