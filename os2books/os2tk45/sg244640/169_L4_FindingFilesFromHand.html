<H1>Finding Files From Handles</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
Open file system objects (files, named pipes, devices etc.) are represented
by the <A HREF="3297_L0_.html">SFT</A> control block. The<B> SFT</B> contains
three sections:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Kernel data<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->File system independent data<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->File system dependent data<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The kernel data section contains information to link the<B> SFT</B> to other
system control blocks and to make the SFT usable by Kernel APIs. Of principle
interest in this section are flags, handle, and pointer to the <A HREF="3295_L0_.html">MFT
</A>and a chain pointer to other<B> SFTs</B> that represent other open instances
of the same object. The kernel data is split into two discontiguous sections
at each end of the<B> SFT</B>.
<P>
The file system independent data section contains information common to
all <A HREF="3303_L0_.html">FSDs</A> needed to drive the file system. Of
principle interest are the file attributes, open mode flags, opening process
id and handle to the associated <A HREF="3299_L0_.html">VPB</A>.
<P>
The file system dependent data section is, as the name suggests, a work
area private to the<B> FSD</B> that manages the file system object.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The <A HREF="322_L3_DDisplayanOS2SystemS.html">.D SFT command</A> formats
the<B> SFT</B> always as if it is a <A HREF="3267_L0_.html">FAT</A> file.
The information displayed in the file system dependent section may be misleading
for non-FAT objects. The names of the fields formatted by<B> .D SFT</B> are
prefixed<B> sfdFAT_</B> for the file system dependent data so make it clear
which information to treat with circumspection. The kernel and file system
independent data name are prefixed with<B> sf_</B> and<B> sfi_</B> respectively.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
When a file system object is opened, DosOpen returns a handle that represents
the open object for all subsequent file system manipulation by the process
until the object is closed. This handle is unique only within process and
is referred to as the <A HREF="3292_L0_.html">JFN</A>. In protect mode processes
the<B> JFN</B> is a 16-bit entity. In <A HREF="3272_L0_.html">VDMs</A>,
however, to be consistent with<B> DOS</B> the<B> JFN</B> is an 8-bit entity,
which may be correlated to the<I> real</I><B> JFN</B> through a table in
the <A HREF="3311_L0_.html">PDB</A>. This is illustrated later.
<P>
Each open file system object is also known by a system-wide unique handle,
the <A HREF="3291_L0_.html">SFN</A>. Once the<B> SFN</B> is known then the
corresponding<B> SFT</B> may be located and thence all file system information
relating to the object.
<P>
Each process is assigned by default a table of 20 words, which is indexed
by the<B> JFN</B>. Each word of the<B> JFN_table</B> contains the corresponding
<B>SFN</B> for the open file. The default<B> JFN_table</B> is imbedded within
the <A HREF="3335_L0_.html">PTDA</A>. Prefixing the<B> JFN_table</B> is
a double-word pointer (<B>JFN_ptable</B>) that points to this table. If
the table is expanded (using<B> DosSetMaxFH</B>) then<B> JFN_ptable</B> is
updated to point to the current<B> JFN_table</B>.
<P>
The key to finding information about open object in a given process is to
locate<B> JFN_ptable</B> and<B> JFN_table</B>. Since both of these fields
are part of the<B> PTDA</B> they may be refered to by name as symbols<B><I> for
the current (system) context only</B></I>. For other contexts we may still
use the<B> PTDA</B>  symbols but in a relative fashion.  The<B> PTDA</B>
symbols are defined for the current process, which means that to use them
successfully for another process, one must relocate them to the PTDA one
wishes to reference.  This is easily done by subtracting the label<B> PTDA_START
</B> from the desired symbol, then adding the address of the<B> PTDA</B>
one wishes to see.  For example:  to see the<B> jfn_table</B>  field, enter

<PRE>         dw &lt;ptda address&gt;+jfn_table-ptda_start L2.</PRE>
 
<P>
The relationships between the<B> JFN_table</B>,<B> PTDA</B> and the<B> SFT
</B>is illustrated in the following diagram:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="169_L4_FindingFilesFromHand_12.gif" WIDTH=717 HEIGHT=1011>
