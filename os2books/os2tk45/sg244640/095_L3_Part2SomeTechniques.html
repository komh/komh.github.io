<P>
Procedures to get control at a point other than a trap:
<P>
One approach is to use clever breakpoints within OS/2. Stopping at the first
executable instruction of a program<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We will make use of a couple of breakpoint commands
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>This command tells the debug kernel that we want
control on the debug terminal at some specific point.  The problem is that
the place where we would like to get control is not loaded into memory until
we run the program, and it is difficult at best to type Control-C at just
the right time.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The initial breakpoint uses the fact that almost
all programs use the DOSCALL1 DLL, which appears to have instance initialization.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Enter the command   BP   DosLibIDisp,'.p*'
<P>
The content of the quoted string is the command to execute when we arrive
at the breakpoint.  This will assure us that we are in the correct context,
because the output of '.p' includes the module name.
<P>
Let the MUT run, and execute OSPREY once again.
<P>
You will probably get control in the context of OSPREY. If not, issue  'g'
again a time or two until you are.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->At this point, OSPREY has been loaded, so we
can set a breakpoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> If you simply try the command
 BP 0F:1BBE, you will discover that the page is not yet loaded. There are
two ways around this problem.<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Use a register breakpoint,  BR   E,0F:1BBE<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL>
b.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Cause OS/2 to bring the page in with   .I  0F:1BBE
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Then reenter the BP command from above.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>However, this is 'cheating' because we already
knew where to stop.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> To find the address of the first
instruction at this point, enter the command  .M  0F:0   Find the MTE handle,
hmte.
<P>
Issue the  .LMO  command with the HMTE as the parameter.
<P>
Alternatively,  try  .LMO 'OSPREY', which works sometimes.
<P>
The output of the .LMO command includes the linear address of the MTE.
<P>
Display the MTE as doublewords, and get the address of the SMTE from the
output; it is in the second doubleword.
<P>
Display the SMTE as doublewords, and you can find the entry point in the
second and third words displayed.
<P>
Now you can set a breakpoint at the entry to any module.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
The PATCH program<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the MUT, execute the EXEHDR utility against
OSPREY.EXE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> EXEHDR is distributed with the developers'
toolkit.
<P>
The output will provide you information you need to patch a program successfully.
The last part of the output should look like
<PRE>Module:                   OSPREY
Description:              OSPREY.EXE
Data:                     NONSHARED
Initial CS:IP:            seg   1 offset 0088
Initial SS:SP:            seg   3 offset 0000
Extra stack allocation:   0a00 bytes
DGROUP:                   seg   3

no. type address  file  mem   flags
  1 CODE 00000200 0247d 0247e
  2 DATA 00000000 00000 00200
  3 DATA 00002800 <!-- entering slot 118 -->007cb 00960
</PRE>

<P>
There are two things we will need in this listing.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The entry point, or initial CS:IP is _________:________
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The location in the file where that segment begins
_________<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The columns labelled 'file' and 'mem'
are the sizes of the segment in the file, and in memory.  The difference
is due to uninitialized data, which is not stored, saving space and reducing
program load time.
<P>
To find the location of an instruction in the file, add the offset to the
file address.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To get control, we will replace a byte with the
hex value 'CC', which is a special one-byte instruction, Int 3, or BreakPoint.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We will patch the call instruction at 1BBE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Add
the offset, 1BBE to the file address 0200  _________
<P>
If you cannot add hex, get the debug kernel's attention, and then type in
 ? 1BBE+0200.   ? is a general purpose evaluation command.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We now know where we want to patch the program.
Let's do it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> On the MUT,  enter the command PATCH
 OSPREY.EXE
<P>
The patch address was calculated above; enter it.
<P>
The byte you are about to replace is hex ______
<P>
Type   CC    then press enter, and complete the confirmations.
<P>
We have now patched the program.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Execute the program on the MUT; you get control
at the INT 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> We need to put back the hex data which
was originally there, so as not to introduce another problem. We will use
the enter command.
<P>
Type the command  E  CS:IP
<P>
You will see the 'CC', type the original data value and press enter.
<P>
Type the command   .R   and you should see the original far call.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This is one way to get control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> It
has problems if the MUT is not where you can touch it.
<P>
Type the commands   G    then     GT  to let OSPREY finish.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Patch OSPREY back to its original content if
you wish.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
