<H1>MAP File Support</H1><!-- entering slot 582 -->
<P>
The Trace Customizer can also use the symbolic information in the MAP file
produced by the linker. All public symbols will be listed with their offsets
in the module being traced. This is not as complete a support as offered
by the debug compile option for C language source files, but it does allow
entry points, public labels and global data to be referenced symbolically
within the TSF. Note that the use of a MAP file is NOT language dependent.

<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
When using a MAP file, if the symbolic name is a C language entry point,
it will be case sensitive (unless the<B> /I</B> command line switch has
been specified).
<P>
Some compilers will modify external or public symbolic names used in the
program when they appear in the MAP file. If this is done then the modified
form must be used when referenced in the TSF. The modification rules are
compiler dependent however three common cases follow:
<P>
With IBM C/2 and Microsoft C 6.0, external routine names have an underscore
prefix to their names when declared using the<B> cdecl</B>  convention and
are capitalised when declared using the<B> Pascal</B>  convention.  Symbols
for routine names treated this way refer to the first instruction of the
routine.
<P>
With IBM CSET/2 and IBM VisualAge C symbolic names defined by the user are
<I>not</I> prefixed with an underscore. MAP file symbols for routine names
defined by the user refer to the initial instruction of the routine, regardless
of the presence of debugging information, unless the<B> /PREINV</B>  command
line switch is specified.  When<B> /PREINV</B> is used TRCUST will search
for the first instruction following the prologue code, that is, after the
entry stack frame has been created.
<P>
With IBM VisualAge C++ routine names are subject to name<I> mangling</I> where
class-hierarchical information is encoded into the externalised name. The
mangled form of the name must be used in TSF references.
<P>
In all cases symbolic name lengths are restricted to a maximum length of
255 characters.
<P>
C runtime library routine names are usually prefixed with an underscore.
