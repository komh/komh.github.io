<H1>The Dispatcher, Priorities, and Dispatching Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 146 -->
<P>
The dispatcher's task is to give control to the proper thread. The definition
of 'proper' thread can be difficult to state. My approach to this problem
is to state the obvious cases, and then to focus on what is left. In a sense,
this discussion parallels the logic in the dispatcher.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Idle Class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> No other
class will be pre-empted in order to run an idle class thread. The notion
of starved, and the MAXWAIT parameter do NOT apply to Idle Class threads.
 OS/2 by design will not execute a ready Idle Class thread as long as threads
in other classes are ready.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Regular Class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Most threads
are expected to be in this class.  All dispatching options and parameters
apply to scheduling this thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Time-Critical Class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> As
long as any thread in this class is ready, OS/2 will give control to it.
By design, this may prevent threads in other classes from running. You cannot
use priority as a serialization method.
<P>
For example, a page fault will result in temporarily blocking this priority
thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Fixed-High, or Server Class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
threads in this class are at a somewhat higher priority than those in the
regular class which do not have the focus, but below time-critical.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The numbers above are what the programmer specifies in DosSetPriority,
or the 16-bit API DosSetPrty, and are what is returned by DosGetPriority.
OS/2 processes these class numbers to create an internal dispatching priority.
There are 32 priority levels in each class, which range from 00 to 1F. The
priority levels, or deltas, stay the same as the programmer specified initially,
if PRIORITY=ABSOLUTE is specified.
<P>
The internal priorities have a range from 01 to 08, with 01 usually used
for idle-class threads, and 08 usually used for time-critical threads. If
PRIORITY=DYNAMIC was specified or defaulted, there are priority boosts given
for the following reasons:
<BR>
Being the foreground process; and for owning the keyboard;
<BR>
Yielding the processor before the end of the time slice
<BR>
IO completion
<BR>
Being 'starved', that is, ready status and not dispatched for MAXWAIT seconds.

<P>
Dispatching is the process of finding the correct ready thread, and then
giving control to it.  Within each class, the priority delta is used to
choose which thread should have control.  When several ready threads have
the same priority, control is given in turn to each of them, based on the
TIMESLICE parameter. The minimum value of this parameter is the duration
of the priority boosts which may be applied. The maximum value is the longest
a thread can execute before being pre-empted for other threads which have
the same internal dispatching priority.
<P>
As long as a group of threads at some priority use all the processor, control
is not given to lower priority threads. What happens is that the other waiting
threads become 'starved' after MAXWAIT seconds have elapsed, and their priority
increases until they receive at least a minimum timeslice.
<P>
Idle-class threads are never starved, and so will not receive this boost.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
When running in the kernel and device drivers, pre-emption can not occur.
 Threads must explicitly give up their time-slice to give other threads
an opportunity to run.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
