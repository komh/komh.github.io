<H1>Part 4: Watching a Ring Transition</H1><!-- entering slot 120 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
We will watch a ring transition by stopping on an instruction which we know
causes a ring transition, display both stacks, then single step the instruction,
and look at both stacks again.
<P>
Get control in OSPREY so that the next instruction is at 0F:1BBE.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
1.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Display the call gate by using  DG  and the selector
from the call.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Write down the target CS______  EIP____________
 DWC_____  PL____<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Display the ring 3 stack as WORDS<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> so
you can see as many DOUBLEWORDS as are passed through the gate.
<P>
Display the ring 0 stack as words, too.  It is technically incorrect to
do this, but for the purposes of this exercise, it makes things easy.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the command   T   to execute the call instruction.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Now, again display the ring 0 stack as words again.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Compare the ring 0 content now with the content
of the ring 3 stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Do not overlook the ring 3
SS and ESP at the top of the ring 0 stack.
<P>
Do not overlook the return address in the ring 0 stack, following the parameters
which were copied by the hardware as it executed the call.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->TIMESAVER:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> If you know
what API will be called, you can simply set the breakpoint at the API, by
using its name.  A side effect is that every thread which calls the API
will stop, so you may want to use something like '.p*' as the command to
execute at the breakpoint, which makes it easy to see when the thread of
interest is there.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
This lab is now complete. However, if you let it run to the failing instruction,
you will find an additional detail about this API, namely that because only
13 words were pushed, and 7 doublewords are needed to get them all copied
into the ring 0 stack, there is one more detail we can see, namely how the
difference (two bytes) is handled.
<P>
If you display the ring 0 stack once again, it has been changed!
<P>
The return will need to add enough to the ring 0 stack pointer that it can
find the ring 3 stack successfully; this is also what is added to the ring
3 stack pointer, because both stacks must be cleaned up.  In order that
this not be destructive of what is already on the ring 3 stack, the ring
0 entry code has adjusted the saved ring 3 ESP downward by 2 before the
trap occurs.  This is an example of some of the work that has been done
within the ring 0 stack by the privileged code.
