<H1>Program Design Issues and Weaknesses</H1><!-- entering slot 217 -->
<P>
The following hit-list identifies potential weaknesses in program design
that can lead to hang symptoms or serialisation problems:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Manipulation of thread priorities for the purpose
of serialisation or sequencing execution is haphazard at best. At worst
the performance of the entire system can be jeopardised.
<P>
The following guidelines should be applied when considering priority manipulation:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Use priority delta to tell the system the relative
importance of an application's threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Avoid priority class manipulation. Priority class
tends to specify the relative importance of a thread with respect to all
other threads in the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Avoid the use of time-critical priority. By setting
this class, a thread is assuming the position of utmost importance in the
system. This may not be a valid assumption for some system configurations
and some users.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If priority class manipulation is desirable under
some circumstances, then it should be parameterised so that it can be controlled
as an option by the user.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
a window of exposure exists it will be exposed.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
3.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Any common resource that is ever modified must
have an associated lock or serialisation mechanism.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Locks (serialisation techniques such as semaphores)
that are concurrently held and waited on must be obtained in an established
order.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  5.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Simplistic approach
(one lock) forces work to be channelled through a single-queue.  Therefore
design locks at the lowest level of contention.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>
6.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Distinguish process/data/repository serialisation
otherwise an inconsistent system of locks may result:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Process locks are required where a only single instance
of a process is allowed to operate.  For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>
<P>
Finite State Machine state transitions;<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
Some FSM state users;<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
Any non-reentrant process.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Distinguishing
Repository locks allows the repository is updated:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>
<P>
disk/directory reorganisation while file data is in use.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
physical page assignments are allowed to change while data is in use - swapping
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 7.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Data
optimisation:  Artificial association of unrelated data items imposes serialisation
constraints that will have two possible effects:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->This necessitates unrelated processes to serialise.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Serialisation may lead to unavoidable deadlocks.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 8.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Code
optimisation:  imposes process lock constraints in a similar way that data
optimisation does.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  9.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>O-O
tends to hide the data repository and structure.  May even hide the process.
 Therefore designers need to consider whether locks are managed internally,
within the object or explicitly.  It may not be possible to handle the locks
internally, because the context in which an instance method is being use
(that is, the process) is not discernible from within the object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
