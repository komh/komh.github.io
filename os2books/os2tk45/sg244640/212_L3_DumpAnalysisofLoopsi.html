<H1>Dump Analysis of Loops in Ring 0 Code</H1><!-- entering slot 310 -->
<P>
Ring zero loops can sometimes be successfully analysed from a dump. The
trick is knowing how to locate the register set at the time the dump was
taken.
<P>
The Dump Formatter only implements the .R command, which obtains the registers
from a stack frame on the thread's ring 0 stack. Under the kernel Debugger
there is no problem: the R command will display the current system registers.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
If a thread never runs in User Mode, such as the internal PID 0 threads
then a stack frame is never built and .R will be unsuccessful in formatting
the registers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
Fortunately there is a way of obtaining the current registers:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
When a dump is initiated using Ctrl-Alt-Numlock-Numlock a keyboard interrupt
is initiated by the processor hardware.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Via the IDT control passes to the interrupt router who is responsible for
switching to the interrupt stack before passing control to the appropriate
interrupt handler.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The interrupt router checks to see if the system is already running from
the interrupt stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
If it isn't then an interrupt stack frame is built on the current stack
and the stack frame pointer is saved in<B> fpoldstack</B>. Then the SS selector
is switched to the interrupt stack selector (E8).<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
If it is then a nested interrupt has occurred and the interrupt stack frame
is built on the interrupt stack itself.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
It is from<B> fpoldstack</B> that we are able to obtain the registers before
any interrupt occurred. The following debug log illustrates this and many
of the techniques previously discussed.
