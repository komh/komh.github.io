<H1>Paging Overview</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
OS/2 V2 uses paging in addition to the above logical addressing. Paging
is a mechanism which converts linear addresses to physical addresses and
allows a consistent size ( 4k ) to be moved back and forth to auxiliary
storage ( SWAPPER.DAT ) when the demand for virtual memory exceeds the physical
memory installed on the machine. Another hardware register, Control Register
3 or CR3, is used to locate a page directory which contains table entries
that locate page tables.  The page tables are used to locate the physical
memory where the data really resides.  Physical memory is sometimes referred
to by page number. A page number is simply the twenty high-order bits of
an address. The twelve low-order bits of a page address are all zero. One
can convert a page number to an address by simply appending three hex zeros
to it.
<P>
THE RESULT OF COMBINING A SEGMENT NUMBER AND AN OFFSET, OR THE ADDITION
OF AN OFFSET TO THE BASE ADDRESS FROM A DESCRIPTOR, IS A LINEAR ADDRESS.
Under OS/2 1.x, these would be physical addresses. Under OS/2 2.0 and following,
these are linear, or virtual addresses.
<BR>
The picture below shows how linear addresses are converted to physical addresses.
 Only the top line in the picture below is a linear address - the rest are
physical.
<P>
The ten high order bits of the linear address are used to index into the
Page Directory which has the twenty high order bits of the page table's
physical address (page number).  The next ten bits of the linear address
are used to index into the page table.  The twenty high order bits of the
page frame's physical address (page number) are retrieved. The twelve low
order bits of the linear address are also the twelve low order bits of the
physical address. Therefore, the physical address is the twenty bits from
the page table entry, followed by the 12 low-order bits from the linear
address.
