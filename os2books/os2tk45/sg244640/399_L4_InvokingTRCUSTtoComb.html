<H1>Invoking TRCUST to Combine TFF files.</H1><!-- entering slot 576 -->
<P>
The syntax for combining TFF files is as follows:
<PRE>
    [d:][path]TRCUST [d:][path]tffsource /C=[d:][path]tffdest [/Wn]

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
TRCUST<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the name of the Trace Customizer program. A drive and path may optionally
be specified to explicitly define the location of the Trace Customizer program,
otherwise the program is searched for in the current directory, followed
by looking along the path defined by the PATH environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tffsource
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the name of a file containing fully qualified (including extensions)
pathnames of TFF files to combine. Each TFF file must use the same major
code and each filename in the<B> tffsource</B> file is separated by white
space. This will combine all TFF files for the same major code into a single
TFF file.  If duplicate minor code format definitions are found, the first
format definition for the minor code remains valid, the duplicates are discarded
and a warning message is issued. If no path is provided the<B> tffsource
</B>file is searched for in the current directory, followed by using the
current value of DPATH.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tffdest<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the name of the trace format destination file to store the combined trace
format definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Wn<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
is the level of error messages to be displayed, where<B> n</B> can be 0,
1, or 2.  The possible message levels are shown below along with the messages
that each displays:
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->fatal and severe messages<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<BR>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->fatal, severe, and error messages<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<BR>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->all (fatal, severe, error, and warning) messages
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
A message level of 2 is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An example of a tffsource file for using the combine TFF files option of
TRCUST is:
<PRE>\TFF\PROG1\TRC00C2.TFF \TFF\PROG2\TRC00C2.TFF
\TFF\PROG3\TRC00C2.TFF \TFF\PROG4\TRC00C2.TFF

</PRE>

<P>
To invoke TRCUST to combine TFF files using the above file as input (assume
filename is \TFF\PROG\TFF00C2) and output the combined format statements
into file \TFF\PROG\TR\TRC00C2.TFF is:
<PRE>
TRCUST \TFF\PROG\TFF00C2 /C=\TFF\PROG\TRC00C2.TFF

</PRE>
