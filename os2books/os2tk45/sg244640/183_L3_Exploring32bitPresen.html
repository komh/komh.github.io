<H1>Exploring 32-bit Presentation Manager Under WARP</H1><!-- entering slot 273 -->
<P>
In this section we look specifically at the messaging function within Presentation
Manager (PM).
<P>
Sending and receiving messages lies at the heart of how PM applications
communicate with each other and the system. Messages may be sent synchronously
and posted asynchronously. The mismanagement of messages by an application
leads frequently to the 'Bad Application' Pop-up dialog. In extreme cases
deadlocks result.
<P>
This topic applies to OS/2 V3, which introduced the 32-bit version of Presentation
Manager. The previous 16-bit environment has analogous concepts which are
briefly explored through a final worked example.
<P>
Pre-requisites to any PM debugging requires the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Availability of the symbol file (<B>PMMERGE.SYM</B>)
 for<B> PMMERGE.DLL</B>.  This should be installed in the same directory
as<B> PMMERGE.DLL</B>  when using the Kernel Debugger  or for dump analysis,
in the same directory as the Dump Formatter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Availability of the PM programming reference from
the Programmer's ToolKit.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Also of use, is ready access to the C header files
from the Programmer's Toolkit.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
We start by giving an overview of the PM messaging environment in which
an application's PM thread operates.
