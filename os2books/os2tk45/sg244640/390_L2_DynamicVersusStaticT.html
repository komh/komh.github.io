<H1>Dynamic Versus Static Trace</H1><!-- entering slot 567 -->
<P>
OS/2 supports two types of tracepoints:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Static tracepoints<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Dynamic tracepoints<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Both types of tracepoints can be used to monitor the execution of a software
module.  They differ in their style of execution.
<P>
Static tracepoints are, essentially, in-line function calls that are always
present.  The OS/2 user has the ability (through the use of the OS/2 TRACE
utility) to indicate that a particular static tracepoint is "enabled". Until
a static tracepoint is enabled, the actual tracepoint logic logic is "branched
over" and not executed.  Once "enabled" the static tracepoint logic is executed.

<P>
Dynamic tracepoints do not normally reside within the software modules to
which they correspond.  They are "patched in" when the OS/2 user uses the
TRACE utility to "enable" a dynamic tracepoint.
<P>
This implies that a dynamic tracepoint does not burden a software module
with any execution overhead until the tracepoint is "patched in" by the
TRACE utility.  There is a small continual performance overhead associated
with a static tracepoint because the tracepoint must always check to see
whether it is currently enabled.  On the other hand, the dynamic tracepoint
mechanism is costlier in operation than the staic tracepoint operation because
its "patching" mechanism is built upon the OS/2 breakpoint mechanism.  Also,
there are some software modules (for example, device drivers) that cannot
use dynamic tracepoints.  Most of the operating system tracepoints listed
in the <A HREF="445_L1_SystemTracepointsRef.html">Trace Reference</A> are
implemented as dynamic tracepoints.
<P>
All Trace event records include a major trace code and a minor trace code
which identify the event which is being recorded.  When the user uses The
TRACE utility to control a specific tracepoint, static tracepoints are identified
by a combination of major and minor trace codes.  Dynamic tracepoints are
identified by a combination of software module name and minor trace code.

<P>
The following general categories of events are traced within OS/2:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->External application program interfaces (APIs)
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Internal interfaces<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Other internal events<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
