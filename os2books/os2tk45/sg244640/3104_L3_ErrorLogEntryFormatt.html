<H1>Error Log Entry Formatting DLL Routines</H1><!-- entering slot 3340 -->
<P>
Each Error Log record within an Error Log file can contain the name of a
formatting DLL module.  A formatting DLL module is invoked by the SYSLOG
utility when SYSLOG encounters an Error Log record that contains the name
of the DLL module.
<P>
Each formatting module contains a single formatting routine that can be
identified by an ordinal value of 1. The formatting routine can be designed
to handle a single type of Error Log entry or to handle multiple types of
Error Log entries.  When SYSLOG passes control to a formatting routine,
it passes the entire Error Log record (both header portion and data portion)
to the formatting routine.  The formatting routine has the complete flexibility
to format an Error Log entry as it deems appropriate.
<P>
SYSLOG uses the<B> DosLoadModule</B> API to create a run-time link to the
specified formatting DLL module.  It uses the<B> DosFreeModule</B> API to
free the DLL module after it receives its response from the formatting routine.

<P>
There are no specific rules that govern the naming of a formatting DLL module.
 However, since it is desirable to reduce the possibility of "colliding"
with another DLL module of the same name, it is suggested that a formatting
DLL module be labelled with a name that adheres to the following standard
form:
<PRE>
        ELGxxxxx.DLL    (where "xxxxx" corresponds to the Error
                           Log record I.D. (in ecimal) of any one
                           of the types of records that the formatting
                           routine is designed to handle)


        for example, "ELG00127.DLL" is a standardized name for a formatting DDL
                     module that recognizes (among other things)
                     Log records with I.D. of 127 (decimal)

</PRE>

<P>
This standard naming convention is suggested because it is assumed that
the Error Log records of any one I.D. will only be recognized by a single
formatting routine.  Therefore the use of the "xxxxx" suffix (based on record
I.D.) should assure uniqueness for the formatting module name.
<P>
The static Error Log record I.D. registration mechanism that is enforced
by the OS/2 development organization will attempt to keep a list not only
of the Error Log record I.D.'s in use, but also the names of the formatting
DLL modules that correspond to each record I.D..  This will also help to
reduce the possibility of formatting DLL module names "colliding".
<P>
In addition to its single formatting routine, each formatting DLL module
must contain a global variable named "ELOG_FORMAT".  For OS/2 2.0, this
exported global variable must be set to a value of 1. When SYSLOG loads
a prospective formatting DLL module it attempts to access this global variable
and check whether it has the expected value of 1. If the global variable
check fails, then SYSLOG can conclude that it has accidentally loaded another
DLL module with the same name as the formatting module that is mentioned
in the Error Log entry.  This check is intended as a form of protective
validation for SYSLOG.  The variable will in future releases be used as
a revision level for the SYSLOG/formatting DLL module interface specification.

<P>
When a user constructs a Error Log entry formatting DLL module, care should
be taken not to export the names of its constituent formatting routine (though
the required ELOG_FORMAT global variable must be exported).  Not exporting
the module name will save storage space within the OS/2 kernel. The SYSLOG
utility will be written to use the "ordinal" version of the<B> DosGetProcAddr
</B>API.
<P>
Error Log record formatting DLL routines must be written as 32 bit procedures.
 A typical Error Log record formatting DLL routine will have to accept the
parameters: 
<PRE>

        ULONG ELGxxxxx((PVOID) Log_Record, (PVOID) String_Buffer,
                       (ULONG) Buffer_Length, (PULONG) String_Length)

</PRE>

<P>
<U><I>Parameters</I></U><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Log_Record</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> a linear pointer to an Error
Log record that is being passed from SYSLOG to the formatting routine.  The
Error Log record adheres to the format that is<!-- entering slot 3341 --> described
in the section that follows entitled "Error Log File Entry Format", except
that the linear pointer points to the "TOT_LENGTH" field (since the "PREV_PTR"
and "PREV_SIZE" fields are of no interest to a formatting routine).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> String_Buffer
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is a linear pointer to a buffer provided by
SYSLOG so that the formatting routine can return a series of ASCIIZ strings
to SYSLOG. Each ASCIIZ string should correspond to a line of formatted display.
Each ASCIIZ string should be limited to a maximum of 80 characters. SYSLOG
will paint each string "line" within its client window.  The strings should
not contain NEWLINE characters.  SYSLOG will automatically format the header
portion of the Error Log entry.  The formatted output prepared by this routine
will follow the formatted header display.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Buffer_Length
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is a 32 bit integer that contains the maximum
size of the the 'String_Buffer'.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> String_Length
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is a pointer to a 32 bit integer that is set
by the formatting routine to the total length of the ASCIIZ strings that
have been placed in 'String_Buffer'.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Returns</I></U>
<P>
<B>ELGxxxxx</B> returns the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<B><LI><LI></B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->indicates insufficient space in 'String_Buffer'
positive values indicate formatting routine errors.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
If a formatting DLL routine returns a positive error code to SYSLOG, SYSLOG
will format the header portion of the Error Log record in the standard manner,
display the returned formatting routine error code (as a line within the
formatted display), and then format the data portion of the Error Log record
as a hexadecimal dump.
<P>
If an Error Log record fails to point to a formatting DLL module, or if
the formatting DLL module cannot be successfully loaded and validated, then
SYSLOG will format the header portion of the Error Log record in the standard
manner, display a message that a formatting routine was not specified or
could not be successfully invoked (as a line within the formatted display),
and then format the data portion of the Error Log record as a hexadecimal
dump.
<P>
If there is insufficient space in the 'String_Buffer', then the formatting
routine will return a -1 status code, and will place the required length
of the formatted display string in the caller's output length variable.
 SYSLOG can react to this error by recalling the formatting routine with
a larger 'String_Buffer'.
<P>
SYSLOG will contain logic to format the standard SNA Generic Alert entry
(that is, Error Log record I.D. of 2).  This is necessary since most of
the existing Error Log calls are used to pass generic alerts (and the existing
calls can not pass in formatting DLL routine names).  This design choice
does not prevent future Error Log callers to specify a record I.D. of 2
and also to pass in the name of a formatting DLL routine that knows how
to specially format that Generic Alert entry.
