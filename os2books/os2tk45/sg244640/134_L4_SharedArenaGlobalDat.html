<P>
DLL Global Data and Named Shared, Giveable and Gettable allocations are
potentially shareable among multiple processes. With these types of allocations
data and address range is common to all who access it. Those that are given
access are recorded by the VMCO chain.
<P>
With this type of allocation, there is only one VMAR, and VMOB.
<P>
Note that the own field of the VMOC, which is interpreted on the right hand
side of the .MO display, may be one of five possibilities:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
hmte<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Data is Global Data or Code segment of a DLL
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Give<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Data is allocated with
the Give attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Get<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Data
is allocated with the Get attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> GiveGet<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Data
is allocated with both the Give and Get attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Mshare
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Data is named shared storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following diagram depicts this situation.

Control blocks and data that directly represent the allocation are shown
