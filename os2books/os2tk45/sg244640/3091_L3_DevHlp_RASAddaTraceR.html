<H1>DevHlp_RAS (Add a Trace Record to the System Trace Buffer)</H1><!-- entering slot 3326 -->
<P>
The<B> DevHlp_RAS</B> function provides a service for device drivers to
add information to the System Trace buffer.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> DevHlp_RAS is a 16-bit API.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<PRE>         MOV   AX,MajorCode           ; major trace event code (240-255)
         MOV   BX,Length              ; length of data area (0-512 bytes)
         MOV   CX,MinorCode           ; minor trace event code (0-255)

<U><I>Parameters.</I></U><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
MajorCode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The major code to be placed in the trace
buffer.  Only the low order byte is used.  The high order byte should be
0 for future compatibility reasons, but no error checking of the high order
byte is performed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Length<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
length of the area pointed to by the address parameter. If a length greater
than 512 is specified, only 512 bytes will be recorded.  If a length of
0 is specified, the address parameter will not be used; however, a dummy
doubleword must be pushed on the stack so that all calls use the same stack
space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MinorCode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The minor
code to be placed in the trace buffer.  This code identifies the specific
trace event. Only the low order byte is used.  The high order byte should
be 0 for future compatibility reasons, but no error checking of the high
order byte is performed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> pData<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
address of the variable length data area which contains additional information
that the system trace function will add to the trace buffer.  If a length
of 0 is specified, the address will not be used, but a value must still
be added to the stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<U><I>Remarks.</I></U>
<P>
The trace facility maintains an array of 32 bytes (256 bits), in which each
bit represents a major event code. This array is updated each time the user
enables or disables tracing of a major event.  The device driver must check
this array before calling<B> DevHlp_RAS</B> to ensure that the major event
specified is currently enabled for tracing. This array is located in the
<A HREF="3281_L0_.html">Global Infoformation Segment.</A>
<P>
All registers are preserved. Interrupts are disabled while the trace data
is saved and then re-enabled if they were initially enabled.
