<H1>Sample Trace Source Files</H1><!-- entering slot 613 -->
<P>
This section gives four sample TSF files. The first is for a module written
in a mix of C and MASM and compiled with 16:16 segmented addressing.  The
second was compiled with 0:32 flat addressing.  The third module consists
of routines, some which were compiled using 16-bit segmented addressing
and some that were compiled using 32-bit flat addressing. The fourth is
for monitoring function references in a module.
