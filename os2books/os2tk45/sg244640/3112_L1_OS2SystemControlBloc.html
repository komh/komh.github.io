<H1>OS/2 System Control Block Reference</H1><!-- entering slot 3351 -->
<P>
This chapter contains details of some of the more important system control
blocks used in debugging.
<P>
Where major differences in format exist between<B> ALLSTRICT</B> and<B> RETAIL</B>,
and between versions of OS/2 then each version of the control block is given.
Otherwise only OS/2 Warp V3.0 ALLSTRICT kernel versions of the control blocks
are given and may be assumed to be applicable to also<B> RETAIL</B> and
earlier versions of OS/2.
<P>
<B>Warning:</B>
<P>
The information given in this is for debugging purposes only. The layout
of the control blocks may change from one release of OS/2 to the next. They
are not to be considered a programming interface.
<P>
