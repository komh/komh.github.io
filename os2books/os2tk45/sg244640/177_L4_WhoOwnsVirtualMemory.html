<H1>Who Owns Virtual Memory and Who Allocated it?</H1><!-- entering slot 245 -->
<P>
In this section we take a look at the primary system structures used in
memory management and how they are located using the Dump Formatter and
Kernel Debugger. These structures are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A HREF="3339_L0_.html">The memory arena record (VMAR)</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="3336_L0_.html">The memory arena header record (VMAH)</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="3334_L0_.html">The memory object record (VMOB)</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="3333_L0_.html">The memory context record (VMCO)</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The examples worked in this section illustrate:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
how to find all memory allocations made by a given process and what executable
made the allocation.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
how to determine ownership of non-system memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
the use of memory objects, pseudo-objects and system objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Memory allocations have many attributes, included among which are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
data or content<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
location or address<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
size<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
ownership<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
requestor<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The composite set of attributes associated with a memory allocation is refered
to as a memory object. OS/2's virtal memory manager tracks memory objects
using arena, object and context records.
<P>
We start by looking at the arena record, which is used to record virtual
address assignements to memory objects.
<P>
The entire system address space of 4 gigabytes is partitioned into three
types of memory arena: <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
System Arena<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This is the range of virtual addresses
where system information and ring0 code executes. Typically device drivers,
file system drivers and the OS2 Kernel executes and uses data assigned to
the System Arena. There is just one instance of the System Arena. It is
assigned the virtual address range from 512 Mb to 4 Gb. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Shared
Arena<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This is the range of virtual addresses assigned
to shared objects. Shared data objects come in two varieties:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
Global data<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Such objects exist as unique entities.
Their address range and data content are common to all accessing processes.
This is achieved by using common page tables in all processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Instance
data<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Such objects share the same address range,
but exist as distinct data instances in each acccessing process. Page table
entries for instance data are specific to each process.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Code
objects from DLL modules are also consigned to the shared arena.
<P>
In general processes are not given automatic access to instance or global
data. Access is granted either implicitly by the system loader because of
calls to other DLLs or explicitly by use of the DosGiveXxxx and DosGetXxxx
set of APIs.
<P>
There is just one shared arena, which reserves initially virtual memory
addresses from 304Mb to 512Mb. This may be expanded by lowering the lower
bondary. The current address range assigned to the shared arena is managed
by a special arena record called the boundary sentinel arena record.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Private
Arena<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This is the range of virtual addesses used
to map objects that are unique to each process. A private arena therefore
exists for each process. In general the page tables of each private arena
will map to unique real storage frames. An exception to this is with code
objects. Since code segments are always read-only then if more than one
process is running the same executable module their page tables will map
to a common set of real storage frames for the code segments of the executable
module.
<P>
Private arenas are assigned an initial address range from 64k to 64M. This
may be expanded upwards as more memory is allocated. The current size of
a private arena is tracked by a special arena record called the sentinel
arena record.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The private arena upper boundary and shared arena lower boundary may grow
towards each other but not overlap.
