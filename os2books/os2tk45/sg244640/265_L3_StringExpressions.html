<P>
These are identified by being enclosed in either single or double quotes.
A string may contain any keyboard character including quotation marks, which
must be duplicated so as not to act as a string terminator. Examples are:

<PRE>       'this is a sting'
       'That''s an other example'
       "and so is this"
</PRE>

<P>
Where there is no ambiguity then terminating quote may be omitted.
