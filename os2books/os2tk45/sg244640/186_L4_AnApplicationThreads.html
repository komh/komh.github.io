<H1>An Application Thread's Messaging Structures</H1><!-- entering slot 276 -->
<P>
The previous section introduced the notion of a message queue and list,
of where there is one pair per PM message thread. We now look at these in
more detail, with the associated PM system structures that comprise the
applications's messaging environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<U><I>The Message Queue Header (MQ)</I></U><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This
structure acts an anchor for all the message processing structures of an
application message thread. It is created by<B> WinCreateMsgQueue</B>, and
the returned<B> HMQ</B> (message queue handle) is the address of this structure.
PM often refers to the address of a<B> MQ</B> as its<B> PMQ</B>.
<P>
The principle fields of interest are:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>
<P>
<I>Offset</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL><I> Description</I><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x14
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The current read position of the message queue.

<P>
Since the message queue is a circular array, four pointers have to be maintained:
the current read position, current write position, top and bottom of array.

<P>
Each queue entry is a<B> QMSG</B> structure.
<P>
Entries are added to the queue in increasing address order, until the maximum
(bottom) is reached then entries are added from the top.
<P>
Removal of entries only involves updating the current read pointer. Thus,
a small trace of past message activity may be seen by scanning backwards
from the current read pointer to the current write pointer.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x18
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The current write pointer.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x24
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The <A HREF="3322_L0_.html">Pid</A> of the message
thread to which this<B> MQ</B> belongs.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x28<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The
<A HREF="3321_L0_.html">Tid</A> of the message thread to which this<B> MQ
</B>belongs.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x44<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The
most recent<B> SMS</B> on which a response is awaited.
<P>
The presence of a non-zero value in this field implies that the message
thread is currently blocked in<B> WinSendMsg</B> waiting for a response.

<P>
If the message thread recurses, for example through the receipt of a synchronous
message, then a subsequent<B> WinSendMsg</B> will cause this field to be
updated. The previous contents are saved on the stack.
<P>
A non-zero value in this field is of prime interest when diagnosing hangs.
It immediately focuses our attention on the recipient of this message.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0x48
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The current<B> SMS</B> received.
<P>
This field is non-zero when an<B> SMS</B> is removed from the receive list
for processing by its associated window procedure.
<P>
When this field is non-zero, it implies that the thread's window procedure
has been dispatched to process a received message.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +09c
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>The Received message list.
<P>
<B>SMSs</B> are chained from this location pending dispatch.
<P>
Upon dispatch the oldest message is removed from the list and pointed to
from offset +0x48 of the<B> MQ</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> +0xa4<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The
<A HREF="3320_L0_.html">thread slot number</A> of the message thread to
which this<B> MQ</B> belongs.
<P>
This is very useful for correlating<B> MQs</B> to threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><U><I>The Send Message Structure (SMS)</I></U><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
<B>SMS</B> is created for synchronous messages and linked to the receive
list (<B>MQ+0x9c</B>) when<B> WinSendMsg</B> is called.
<P>

</UL>+30<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Message parameter 2.
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>Offsets +0x14 and +0x18 are of prime interest in
diagnosing hangs. They enable us to locate the recipient of a message, of
which a response is pending and therefore the thread which is causing our
thread to remain blocked. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><U><I> The Queue Message
Structure (QMSG)</I></U><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This is the structure
used by applications when calling<B> WinDispatchMsg</B>.
<P>
The<B> QMSG</B> is also the form of an entry on the application's message
queue.

<UL>The window handle (<B>HWND</B>). This is an index

<UL> This is a global table that is used
to correlate window handles (<B>HWNDs</B>) with pointers to<B> WNDs</B> (<B>PWNDs</B>).
The table comprises a 0x20 byte header with 8-byte entries. The first word
of each entry is a<B> PWND</B>  and the second a Boolean flag, which if
non-zero, indicates that an<B> HWND</B>/<B>PWND</B> combination is non-deleteable.

<P>
The handle table may be located from the address at symbol:

The<B> WND</B> has two main functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
