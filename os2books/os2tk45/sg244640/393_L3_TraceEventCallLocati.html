<H1>Trace Event Call Location</H1><!-- entering slot 570 -->
<P>
Trace events, each with a unique minor code, should be placed at the following
locations within a component or subsystem performing a service as a result
of an external API call:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pre-Invocation:  At the beginning of any external
interface before performing any actions or changing any data. This is considered
pre-invocation of a service.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Post-Invocation:  Before returning from performing
any service through an external interface. This is considered post-invocation
of a service, and is significant since:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Information may be returned to the caller which
is of interest for problem determination<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> b.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>It causes a "service completion" event to
be added to the trace buffer which may be paired with the pre-invocation
trace event<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  3.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Other:
 Events within a component should be considered as points of interest for
tracing when they may be used for problem determination within the component
or subsystem. These include:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Significant changes in the state of the machine.
<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> b.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Significant changes in
the state of the system. System state changes are usually those which affect
system data structures. These structures are those which are referenced
by more than one component or which represent significant system resources.
<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL> c.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Allocation or deallocation
of a resource managed by a component performing a service<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This detail is determined and assigned by each component or subsystem owner.
