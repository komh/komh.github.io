<H1>How to Display Dispatching Priority</H1><!-- entering slot 147 -->
<P>
Use the '.p' command on the slot of interest, and find the pTCB, which is
the linear address of the Thread Control Block.
<P>
For slot F, below, we see the following FOR .p output:

DB  %7D16A5DC+164  L 6           would show ( for slot f )
                                 SEE CAUTION, BELOW
%7D16A740   02  1F  xx  xx  1F  06
    class  /   /            ------  the word value 061F
      level  /              actually used by the dispatcher

</PRE>

<P>
CAUTION: the offset used is correct for WARP CONNECT, but the addresses
are what were used in OS/2 2.11, so this is a somewhat mixed example. Any
offset in any control block may change any time a fix or new version is
installed. Please refer to the <A HREF="3172_L3_ThreadControlBlockOS.html">Thread
Control Block</A> in the System Diagnostic Reference for offsets relating
to other versions.
<P>
The first byte is the programmer's priority class, ranging from 1 to 4.
The second byte is the level within the class, ranging from 00 to 1F. The
third and fourth bytes are not useful. The fifth and sixth bytes are OS/2's
computed dispatching priority. This field is a word, so the high order part
is byte 6.
<BR>
081F is the highest possible value.
<BR>
0100 is the lowest possible value.
<P>
On a uniprocessor, using DosSetPriority to make yourself time-critical at
the highest delta value would give you an extremely good chance of not being
pre-empted, and was occasionally misused for serialization. This will never
work on a multiprocessor, and is risky even on a uniprocessor, because a
page fault will cause you to lose control while the page is processed, just
as doing I/O to a file will cause a thread to block if access to the actual
device is required.
