<H1>Waiting for Message Activity</H1><!-- entering slot 281 -->
<P>
In order to process synchronous messages as swiftly as possible, PM always
checks the receive list of the current thread for pending<B> SMSs</B> before
waiting on an internal PM semaphore. 
<P>
If<B> SMSs</B>  are found queued, they are successively dispatched.
<P>
Only when the receive list has been processed does PM finally wait on a
semaphore. 
<P>
This applies particularly to the message processing semaphore, but also
equally to semaphores that serialise access to resources such as the .INI
files.
