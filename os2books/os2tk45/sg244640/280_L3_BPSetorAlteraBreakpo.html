<P>
<U><I>Parameters:</I></U><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B><I>n</B></I><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Explicitly specifies a breakpoint
number to be assigned to this breakpoint. A value from 0 to 9 may be specified.
If specified there must be no space between the number and the<B> BP</B> command.

<P>
The default is to assign the lowest available number. If all 10 breakpoint
numbers have been assigned then the following message appears:
<PRE>Too many breakpoints
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B><I>addr</B></I><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
<A HREF="270_L4_AddressSeparatorsand.html">address</A> of the breakpoint.

<P>
The Kernel Debugger saves the byte of storage at the location specified
by<B><I> addr</B></I> and inserts an<B> INT 3</B> instruction in its place.

<P>
<B>Notes </B>
<P>
Whenever the Kernel Debugger is entered the storage overlayed by any breakpoints
is temporarily restored. When the Kernel Debugger gives control back to
the system, enabled breakpoints are re-instated.
<P>
If<B><I> addr</B></I> specifies the address of an existing breakpoint then
the existing breakpoint is updated with the new parameters.
<P>
Each break-point address is recorded with its associated process context.
For shared data this is of no consequence. However for private addresses,
especially those in the private arena the<B><I> addr</B></I> may be qualified
by <A HREF="3320_L0_.html">slot</A> number by using the<B> |</B> operator.
This acts as a shorthand to save changing contexts using the <A HREF="386_L3_SSetorDisplayDefault.html">.S
command</A> in order to set the breakpoint correctly. For example, suppose
the current slot is 8, then:
<PRE>      BP 31 | %10032
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to:
<PRE>      .S 31
      BP 31 | %10032
      .S 8
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B><I>passcount</B></I><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies
the number of times the breakpoint may be passed before the Kernel Debugger
is entered. Each time the breakpoint is passed the count is decremented
by 1 until 1 is reached. When the breakpoint is encountered with a count
of 1 then it will<I> fire</I> and the Kernel Debugger will be entered. Thus
if<B> passcount</B> is<B> 5</B> then the breakpoint will<I> fire</I> on
the<B> 5th</B> encounter.
<P>
The default passcount is 1, that is, the breakpoint will<I> fire</I> on
first encounter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B><I> cmd</B></I><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Specifies
a command to be executed when the breakpoint<I> fires.</I> More than one
command may be specified by using a semi-colon separator and enclosing the
entire command list in single or double quotes.
<P>
If no command string is specified then the default command string, as specified
by the <A HREF="316_L3_ZSetExecuteorDisplay.html">Z command</A> will be
executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Results &amp; Notes:</I></U>
<P>
If the specified address is valid then the breakpoint definition is accepted
otherwise one of the following messages is generated:
<PRE>Invalid linear address: %<B><I>nnnnnnnn</B></I>Invalid selector: <B><I>selector:offset</B></I>
Past end of segment <B><I>selector:offset</B></I>
</PRE>

<P>
If the break-point is successfully defined then the in-built mnemonic<B> BRn</B>,
where<B> n</B> corresponds to the break-point number, takes the value of
the break-point address. This may be used in any address expression or any
command.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Since<B> BP</B> break-points are implemented by the insertion of<B> INT
3</B> instructions, it is possible for such break-points to become discarded
if the page of code is discarded and<!-- entering slot 406 --> subsequently
paged back into memory.
<P>
If the <A HREF="334_L3_ISwapinStorage.html">.I command</A> is used to swap
in a page of code, then the break-points are automatically restored. (In
earlier versions of OS/2 it was necessary to specify the<B> B</B> option
of<B> .I</B>).
<P>
This complexity may be avoided by setting register break-points with the
<A HREF="281_L3_BRSetorAlteraDebugRe.html">BR command</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
