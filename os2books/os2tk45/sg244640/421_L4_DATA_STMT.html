<H1>DATA_STMT</H1><!-- entering slot 602 -->There are three types of data that may be traced
as part of the optional DATA_STMT section of the TRACE statement.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Registers<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Memory<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
ASCIIZ strings<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
More than one keyword is permitted in a tracepoint definition. The order
of the statements defines the order in which the data is inserted into the
trace buffer.
<P>
The combined amount of data to be traced for a single tracepoint cannot
exceed MAXDATALENGTH.  If TRCUST determines that the maximum data size might
be exceeded, a warning message is issued but the tracepoint definition will
remain valid.
<P>
The keywords for tracing the three types of data are<B> REGS</B>,<B> MEM32</B>,
<B>MEM</B>,<B> ASCIIZ32</B>, and<B> ASCIIZ</B>.
<P>
The<B> REGS</B> keyword identifies which registers are to be recorded in
the trace buffer.
<P>
The<B> MEM32</B> keyword is used to record sections of memory in the trace
buffer.  Access to this memory location is through 32-bit flat addresses
from functions compiled using 32-bit addressing. Several MEM32 parameters
may be coded at any one tracepoint if several different memory areas are
to be traced.
<P>
The<B> MEM</B> keyword is also used to record sections of memory in the
trace buffer, but access to this memory is through a segment:offset pair.
 This is used for functions compiled using 16-bit addressing with segment
registers. Several MEM parameters may be coded at any one tracepoint if
several different memory areas are to be traced.
<P>
The<B> ASCIIZ32</B> keyword is used to record an ASCIIZ string in the trace
buffer. This is a special form of the MEM32 keyword and there may be more
than one ASCIIZ32 parameter coded for a single tracepoint.
<P>
The<B> ASCIIZ</B> keyword is used to record an ASCIIZ string in the trace
buffer. This is a special form of the MEM keyword and there may be more
than one ASCIIZ parameter coded for a single tracepoint.
