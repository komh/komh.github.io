<U><I>IOBLOCK</I></U> Anonymous Pipe data structure 
<P>
A 'pipe' is a connection between (among) file handles (JFN's). Data written
to the 'write end' of the pipe are made available for reading on the 'read
end'.  The $Pipe system call creates a pipe and returns two file handles,
one for the read end and one for the write end.  These handles are manipulated
in the same way as normal file handles; they may be 'dup'ed and are inherited
in the same way.  Data are written into a pipe via a 'write' system call
on the write end of the pipe.  Likewise, data are read from the pipe via
a 'read' call on the read end. 
<P>
Data that are written to a pipe are captured in a circular buffer. The size
of the buffer is specified when the pipe is created; if no size is specified,
a default size is used. 
<P>
The circular buffer is described by an 'ioblock'.  The ioblock is the buffer's
header; the circular buffer proper follows the ioblock in a heap memory
object (mapped by a GDT selector) allocated when the pipe is created.  The
ioblock contains all of the per-pipe information, such as reader, writer,
and reference counts, and also holds the pointers into the circular buffer
proper. 
<P>
The selector that points to the circular buffer is stored in the SFT, at
sfi_hVPB. 
<P>
When the in and out pointers are equal, the circular buffer is empty.  When
the in pointer trails the out pointer by 1, the buffer is full.  Thus, a
512 byte buffer can hold only 511 bytes; one byte is lost so that full and
empty conditions can be distinguished.  So that the user can put 512 bytes
in a pipe that they created with a size of 512, we allow for this byte lost
when allocating the segment.
