<H1>MINOR Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 592 -->
<P>
The MINOR parameter is an optional keyword parameter.  If it is specified
in the first tracepoint definition, it must be specified in every tracepoint
definition.  If it is not specified in the first tracepoint definition,
it cannot be specified in any of the subsequent tracepoint definitions.
It should be coded as:
<PRE>
        MINOR=nnnnn,

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
nnnnn<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a decimal number from 1 to 65535 or a hex number from 0x1 to 0xFFFF.
This represents the minor code for the tracepoint, which should normally
be unique within the major code specified for this module.  When duplicates
are encountered, the original trace definition is saved and duplicates are
discarded with an error message.
<P>
Duplicate minor codes within major code are permitted when the<B> /D</B> command
line switch is specified. However there are precautions to note:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
Any formatting information specified in trace definitions with duplicate
minor codes is discarded. Only the original is retained in the generated
TFF.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
Use of duplicate minor codes should be limited tracepoints where a common
formatting template may be used.  For example, multiple exit points from
a routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> If minor codes are not specified at all
in the TSF then TRCUST will generate them sequentially for each trace definition
encountered starting with 1. However, if any definition has an explicit
minor code specified then all definitions must have explicit minor codes
specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
