<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3639 -->The Command Subtree Identifier is used to represent
a part of a process (or command) tree headed by a particular parent process.
The ID used is the <A HREF="3322_L0_.html">Pid</A> of the process that heads
the subtree.
<P>
Normally a process has a CSID equal to it's own <A HREF="3322_L0_.html">Pid</A>.
However, when processes become orphaned they acquire the subtree Id of their
original parent and become adopted by their grand-parents by acquiring their
grand-parents's Pid as their new parent Pid.
