<H1>Near CALL & RETurn</H1><!-- entering slot 72 -->
<P>
The near CALL instruction is used to invoke a subroutine.  The instruction
first pushes IP into the stack and then updates IP so that it contains the
offset of the first instruction in the subroutine.
<P>
The near form of the RETurn instruction is really just a POP IP, which restores
the saved content of IP.  Execution continues at the instruction following
the CALL.
