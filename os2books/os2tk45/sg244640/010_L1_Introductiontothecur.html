Recent releases of OS/2 have introduced an number of so called<B><I> RAS
enhancements</B></I> and fixes to the System Debugging facilities. These
enhancements have been released mainly in two major fix packs:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

All RAS enhancements are available with the base release of OS/2 Warp E-Server

This edition of the The OS/2 Debugging Handbook has been updated to include
information on some of these new debugging facilities. For interim update
0.5 I have concentrated on updating the system structres and trace information
for OS/2 Warp V4.0. Notes have been added throughout where the internal
implementation differs from earlier releases.
<P>
Interim update 0.7 contains major updates to TRCUST, RASKDATA, SYSDUMP,
TRAPDUMP, TRAPLOG and the System Trace Reference that reflect the latest
RAS enhancements.  It also includes additional information on the SYS317x
exception popup message.
