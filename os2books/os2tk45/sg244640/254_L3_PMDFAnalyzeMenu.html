<H1>PMDF Analyze Menu</H1><!-- entering slot 379 -->
<P>

its own menu selection. Where parameters are required they should be highlighted
by double-clicking mouse button 1 on text in the scrollable window.

<P>
The output from the Analyze options needs to interpreted with care. Some
options are precise since they follow control block chains anchored from
the <A HREF="3294_L0_.html">SAS</A>, for example the Physical Device Driver
Chain and Kernel Heap. Others depend, for correct results, on correct symbols
being loaded. Some options, for example those that display stacks, are more
speculative in what they display.
<P>
Before these facilities are relied on, the user should thoroughly acquaint
themselves with the manual techniques that belie their function. This information
is available in the course materials that comprise the first section of
this Handbook.
