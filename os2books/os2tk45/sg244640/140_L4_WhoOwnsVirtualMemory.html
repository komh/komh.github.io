<H1>Who Owns Virtual Memory?</H1><!-- entering slot 171 -->
<P>
Given a virtual address, the procedure for determining who owns and is using
this memory essentially amounts to the following steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the question of ownership relates to a known
process's private storage then determine its hptda.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Locate the arena record(s) that encompass the
address.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If more than one then select the one that relates
to the process of interest (if known) by matching the hptda.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Locate the object records that are chained to
the arena record.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If more than one then select the process of interest
by matching the hptda.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Note the own and hmte values and their interpretation
on the right-hand side of the VMOB display.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If necessary format the own and hmte VMOBs.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If either is an MTE then use .LM or .LMO, with
the hob as parameter, to format the MTE.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the memory is shared (hco=nnnnn appears in
the arena record display) then format the chain of VMCOs and select the
one that matches hptda from step 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Fortunately this task is reduced in complexity because of the<B> M</B> or
match option that exists with both the .MO and .MA commands.
<P>
.MOM <B><I> addr</B></I> will display the VMOB of a pseudo-object that matches
the<B><I> addr</B></I> if it exists.  PTDAs are pseudo-objects and their
addresses are listed by the .P command.
<P>
.MAM<B><I> addr</B></I> will search for all arena records whose address
range encompasses<B><I> addr</B></I>. Under the kernel Debugger this search
is restricted to the current context unless the<B> A</B> option (all contexts)
is also specified. Under the dump formatter<B> A</B> in always in effect.

<P>
The<B> C</B>  option further reduces the effort.  This is the chain option
and is applicable to .MO, .MA, .MC and .ML commands.  Chaining formats all
VMOBs, VMARs, VMCO and VMALs that are chained from each VMAR associated
with the VM control block being formatted.
<P>
.MAMC (or .MAMAC under the DF) are the default options if just .M is specified.
 Furthermore the matching address defaults to the current CS:EIP.
<P>
The following sections illustrate memory ownership in:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Shared Arena Global Data<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Shared Arena Instance Data<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Private Arena Shared and Private Data<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Physical Storage.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
