<P>
These API's will serialize all threads in a process.  They have no effect
on threads in other processes. At the time control returns from DosEnterCriticalSection,
no other thread in the process is allowed to execute (there is an exception
to this which is when is signal is sent to a process). Looking at the threads'
status, one may see 'crt'. This is NOT the thread that entered critical
section. Threads in the 'crt' state are ready to run but are temporarily
held because of the existence of the thread in critical section. The critical
section thread may block, but is the only thread in that process which is
allowed to run. Only when that thread issues the DosExitCriticalSection
are the other threads released, and again allowed to compete for use of
the processor.  This is really too much serialization for most situations,
because it temporarily disables multithreading in the process, regardless
of the other threads' design, or current actual processing.
