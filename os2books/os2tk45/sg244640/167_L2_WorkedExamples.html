<H1>Worked Examples</H1><!-- entering slot 218 -->
<P>
The following collection of worked examples illustrate how to use the debugging
tools, in particular the Dump Formatter and Kernel Debugger to obtain information
from a system under diagnosis.
<P>
The following topics are included:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<A HREF="168_L3_HowtoFindFileSystemI.html">Finding File System information
</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>This gives techniques for obtianing open file
information and correlating open file names to handles and vice versa and
finding out about record locking.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="176_L3_ExploringMemoryManag.html">Exploring
Memory Management</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This gives techniques for
obtaining memory owner ownership and discovering who allocated a particular
memory object. Name shared memory and Kernel heap memory are also discussed.

Presentation Manager</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This give techniques for
finding Message Queues, Window Procedures and Window structures.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="212_L3_DumpAnalysisofLoopsi.html">Debugging
Ring 0 Loops from a Dump</A><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Dealing with ring
0 loops is relatively straight forward from the Kernel Debugger. It is also
possible to diagnose Ring 0 problems from a dump if the current registers
can be determined. This section given an example of using this technique
in a File System Driver loop.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
