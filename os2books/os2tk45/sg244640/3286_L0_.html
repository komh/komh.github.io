<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3602 -->A<B> breakpoint</B> is a location in a program
where execution is suspended and control is given to a debugging tool.
<P>
The<B> INTEL</B> architecture supports two implementations of breakpoints
for debugging purposes:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The software generated breakpoint using the<B> INT 3</B> instruction;<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The hardware generated breakpoint using the<B> Debugging Registers</B>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The use of software breakpoints require code modification, whereas the use
of debugging registers does not. However, the number of predefined software
breakpoints is potentially unlimited whereas there are only 4 breakpoints
specifiable using<B> Debugging Registers.</B>
<P>
A further distinction between the two types is that software breakpoints
only intercept the execution of a particular instruction path, whereas<B> Debugging
Registers</B> may be used, in addition, to intercept data fetches and stores
from a particular location in virtual memory.
<P>
The Kernel Debugger supports both implementations of breakpoints through
the use of the:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A HREF="281_L3_BRSetorAlteraDebugRe.html">BR command</A>,which uses<B> Debugging
Registers</B>, and<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="280_L3_BPSetorAlteraBreakpo.html">BP command</A>, which uses<B> INT
3</B> instructions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Kernel Debugger limits the predefinition of<B> BP</B> breakpoints to
<B>10</B>, however the programmer may code as may additional<B> INT 3</B> instructions
into his/her program as desired.
<P>
The Kernel Debugger refers to breakpoints explicitly set by the<B> BP</B> and
<B>BR</B> commands as<B><I> sticky</B></I> (implying a certain permanence
about them). The <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G command</A> may have one or
more temporary breakpoints established when one or more<B><I> stop addresses
</B></I>are specified. These are referred to as<B><I> go</B></I> breakpoints.
Once the Kernel Debugger breaks in<B><I> go</B></I> breakpoints are removed.
The internal operation of the Kernel Debugger may also necessitate the use
of the occasional<B><I> temporary</B></I> breakpoints when instruction tracing
(see the <A HREF="311_L3_TTraceInstructionExe.html">T</A> and <A HREF="307_L3_PPTraceInstructionEx.html">P
</A>commands). These are set implicitly and discarded without the user being
aware of their existence.<B><I> Go</B></I> and<B><I> temporary</B></I> breakpoints
are created using the<B> INT 3</B> instruction.<B><I> Go</B></I> and<B><I> sticky
</B></I><B>BP</B> breakpoints count towards the Kernel Debugger imposed
limit of<B> 10</B>, but<B><I> temporary</B></I> breakpoints only ever exist
singly so do not.
