<H1>The Wait Condition - Diagnostic Techniques</H1><!-- entering slot 152 -->
<P>
In most problem analyses the question of memory ownership or use will arise.
For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<I>To which module does this instruction belong?</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<I>Which process executed this module?</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<I>Who allocated this storage?</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<I>Who passed these parameters?</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<I>What control block does this address point to?</I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In fact the frequency with which this question is asked makes it a fundamental
aspect of analytical technique.
<P>
For hang analysis this is no less true:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
In the case of loops, analysis proceeds in a similar manner to that of traps.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
In the case of waits, a key piece of information is the <A HREF="3351_L0_.html">BlockId</A>.
In many cases this is an address of a system control block that relates
closely to the reason for waiting. Discovery of the owner of storage pointed
to by a BlockId is therefore of prime interest.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
We start by reviewing memory management in OS/2 and in particular memory
ownership.
