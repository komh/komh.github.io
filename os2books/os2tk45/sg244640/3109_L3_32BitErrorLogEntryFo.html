<H1>32-Bit Error Log Entry Formatting DLL Routines</H1><!-- entering slot 3347 -->
<P>
Each Error Log record within an Error Log file can contain the name of a
formatting DLL module.  A formatting DLL module ise invoked by the SYSLOG
utility when SYSLOG encounters an Error Log record that contains the name
of the DLL module.
<P>
Each formatting module contains a single formatting routine that can be
identified by an ordinal value of 1. The formatting routine can be designed
to handle a single type of Error Log entry or to handle multiple types of
Error Log entries.  When SYSLOG passes control to a formatting routine,
it passes the entire Error Log record (both header portion and data portion)
to the formatting routine.  The formatting routine has the complete flexibility
to format an Error Log entry as it deems appropriate.
<P>
SYSLOG uses the<B> DosLoadModule</B> API to create a run-time link to the
specified formatting DLL module.  It also uses the<B> DosFreeModule</B> API
to free the DLL module after it receives its response from the formatting
routine.
<P>
There are no specific rules that govern the naming of a formatting DLL module.
 However, since it is desirable to reduce the possibility of "colliding"
with another DLL module of the same name, it is suggested that a formatting
DLL module be labeled with a name that adheres to the following standard
form:
<PRE>
        ELGxxxxx.DLL    (where "xxxxx" corresponds to the Error
                           Log record I.D. (in ecimal) of any one
                           of the types of records that the formatting
                           routine is designed to handle)


        e.g. "ELG00127.DLL" is a standardized name for a formatting
                DDL module that recognizes (among other things) Error
                Log records with I.D. of 127 (decimal)

</PRE>

<P>
This standard naming convention is suggested because it is assumed that
the Error Log records of any one I.D. will only be recognized by a single
formatting routine.  Therefore the use of the "xxxxx" suffix (based on record
I.D.) should assure uniqueness for the formatting module name.
<P>
The static Error Log record I.D. registration mechanism that is enforced
by the OS/2 RAS development group will attempt to keep a list not only of
the Error Log record I.D.'s in use, but also the names of the formatting
DLL modules that correspond to each record I.D..  This may also help to
reduce the possibility of formatting DLL module names "colliding".
<P>
In addition to its single formatting routine, each formatting DLL module
must contain a global variable named "ELOG_FORMAT". This exported global
variable must be set to a value of 1. When SYSLOG loads a prospective formatting
DLL module it will attempt to access this global variable and check whether
it has the expected value of 1. If the global variable check fails, then
SYSLOG can conclude that it has accidentally loaded another DLL module with
the same name as the formatting module that is mentioned in the Error Log
entry.  This check is intended as a form of protective validation for SYSLOG.
 The variable may in future releases be used a sort of revision level for
the SYSLOG/formatting DLL module interface specification.  That is why it
will initially be forced to a value of 1.
<P>
When a user constructs a Error Log entry formatting DLL module, care should
be taken not to export the names of its constituent formatting routine (though
the required ELOG_FORMAT global variable must be exported).  Not exporting
the module name will save storage space within the OS/2 kernel.
<P>
Error Log record formatting DLL routines must be written as 32-bit procedures.
 A typical Error Log record formatting DLL routine will have to accept the
parameters: 
<PRE>
        APIRET APIENTRY ELGxxxxx(PVOID Log_Record,
                                 PVOID String_Buffer,
                                 ULONG Buffer_<!-- entering slot 3348 -->Length,
                                 PULONG String_Length);


</PRE>

<P>
<U><I>Parameters</I></U><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Log_Record<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is a linear pointer to an Error Log record
that is being passed from SYSLOG to the formatting routine.  The Error Log
record adheres to the format that is described in the section that follows
entitled "Error Log File Entry Format", except that the linear pointer points
to the "TOT_LENGTH" field (since the "PREV_PTR" and "PREV_SIZE" fields are
of no interest to a formatting routine).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> String_Buffer<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is
a linear pointer to a buffer provided by SYSLOG so that the formatting routine
can return a series of ASCIIZ strings to SYSLOG. Each ASCIIZ string should
correspond to a line of formatted display.  Each ASCIIZ string should be
limited to a maximum of 80 characters.  SYSLOG will paint each string "line"
within its client window.  The strings should not contain NEWLINE characters.
 SYSLOG will automatically format the header portion of the Error Log entry.
 The formatted output prepared by this routine will follow the formatted
header display.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Buffer_Length<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is
a 32 bit integer that contains the maximum size of the the 'String_Buffer'.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>String_Length<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>is a pointer
to a 32 bit integer that is set by the formatting routine to the total length
of the ASCIIZ strings that have been placed in 'String_Buffer'.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>

<P>
If a formatting DLL routine returns a positive error code to SYSLOG, SYSLOG
will format the header portion of the Error Log record in the standard manner,
display the returned formatting routine error code (as a line within the
formatted display), and then format the data portion of the Error Log record
as a hexadecimal dump.
<P>
If an Error Log record fails to point to a formatting DLL module, or if
the formatting DLL module cannot be successfully loaded and validated, then
SYSLOG will format the header portion of the Error Log record in the standard
manner, display a message that a formatting routine was not specified or
could not be successfuly invoked (as a line within the formatted display),
and then format the data portion of the Error Log record as a hexadecimal
dump.
<P>
If there is insufficient space in the 'String_Buffer', then the formatting
routine will return a -1 status code, and will place the required length
of the formatted display string in the caller's output length variable.
 SYSLOG can react to this error by recalling the formatting routine with
a larger 'String_Buffer'.
<P>
SYSLOG contains logic to format the standard SNA Generic Alert entry (i.e.
Error Log record I.D. of 2).  This is necessary since most of the existing
Error Log calls are used to pass generic alerts (and the existing calls
can not pass in formatting DLL routine names).  This design choice does
not prevent future Error Log callers to specify a record I.D.  of 2 and
also to pass in the name of a formatting DLL routine that knows how to specially
format that Generic Alert entry.
