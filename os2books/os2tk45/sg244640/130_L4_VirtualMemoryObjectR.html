<H1>Virtual Memory Object Records</H1><!-- entering slot 160 -->
<P>
VMOBs are 16-byte records allocated contiguously in a table in system memory.
Each table entry is numbered from 1 and is referred to as a memory object
handle, or more simple as a<B> hob</B>. 
<P>
VMOBs are use to store information about the allocation request. Of particular
interest are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Requestor<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Owner<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Permissions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The VMOB also has links to other related control blocks. Of these the important
ones are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The associated VMAR,<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
the associated VMCOs,<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
and associated VMOBs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
VMOB is formatted by using the KDB or DF<B> .MO</B> command.<B> .MO</B> takes
either the handle or address or the VMOB as a parameter, or if no parameters
are specified then the entire VMOB table is formatted.

<P>
One VMOB is formatted per line with the hob in the left-hand column.
<P>
The owner is shown under the<B> own</B> column and is given as a hob that
is associated with and uniquely identifies where the allocation is made
from. For example:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Memory dynamically allocated within a Private arena uses the handle of the
PTDA (<B>hptda</B>) as the owner.
<P>
The PTDA has a number of characteristics that make it an ideal choice for
an owner:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
Each process has a unique PTDA<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
The PTDA is the central control block from which all information about a
process is obtained.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
Each PTDA is allocated from a unique memory object so has a unique hob,
which defined to be the hptda.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> For storage allocated
for a load module segment the module MTE handle (<B>hmte</B>) is used.
<P>
The MTE has a number of characteristics that make is an ideal choice for
an owner:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
Each loaded module is represented in the system by an unique MTE.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
Each MTE is allocated from a unique memory object so has a unique associated
hob, which is defined to be the hmte.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Memory
allocated in the shared arena which is not specific to a particular process
uses the following conventions for owner:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For DLL instance and global data the owner is the
hmte of the owning DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For Giveable shared storage, the owner is (0xfff5).
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For Gettable shared storage, the owner is (0xfff6).
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For Giveable and Gettable shared storage, the owner
is (0xfff7).<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->For Named Shared Storage, the owner is (0xff82).
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL>See DosAllocSeg, DosGiveSeg, DosGetSeg and DosAllocSharedMem
APIs in the Control Program Programming References for OS/2 1.x, 2.x and
3.x.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Memory allocated or suballocated from the system arena uses an artificial
system owner id (ffxx) that doesn'<!-- entering slot 161 -->tactuallycorrespondtoaVMOBbutisaconventionalhandleusedtoindicatethetypeofsystemobjectwhichhasbeenallocated
.Anexamplethisishob1whichisthetableofVMOBs .<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The requestor's id is shown in the<B> hmte</B> column. This field is either:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The hmte of the module making the request.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
An associated system object<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
zero where there is no associated requestor.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To the right of each line appears a textual interpretation of the<B> own
</B>and<B> hmte</B> fields.
<P>
The handle of the associated <A HREF="129_L4_VirtualMemoryArenaRe.html">VMAR
</A>is shown in the<B> har</B> column.
<P>
Associated VMOB's that share the same virtual address (that is, instance
data) are linked from the<B> hobnxt</B> field.
<P>
Not every VMOB is linked to an associated VMAR, as seen in hobs 4 and 5
in the example. These are known as pseudo-objects. They are used for some
small system control blocks that are allocated, as required, from system
storage but are too small to warrant the overhead of the minimum allocation
of 1 page, which an arena records implies. PTDAs and MTEs are the most frequently
encountered pseudo-objects. The<B> va</B> field replaces the<B> har</B> and
<B>hobnxt</B> and points directly at the object itself.
