<P>
This is the case where .EXE program Read/Only segments are shared across
multiple Private Arenas.
<P>
The following diagram depicts this situation.
<P>
Note that only one VMOB is used, but there are multiple VMARs, one for each
process accessing the allocation. Each VMAR is linked using the link field.

<P>
Control blocks and data that directly represent the allocation are shown
shaded. <!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="133_L4_PrivateArenaSharedDa_4.gif" WIDTH=762 HEIGHT=1016>
