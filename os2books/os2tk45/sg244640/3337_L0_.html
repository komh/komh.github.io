<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3653 -->The<B> Virtual Memory Alias Record (VMAL)</B> is
used to represent aliased regions of virtual memory. These are either:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
regions of physical storage that may be addressed by more than one virtual,
or<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
linear address that are not associated with a memory object, such as VDM
<A HREF="3328_L0_.html">UVIRT</A> allocations.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When two memory objects are aliases of each other then they need not have
co-incident sizes or origins within the aliased arena record. Aliases are
designed to provide alternative attributes for accessing the same piece
of data within or across processes.  Compare this with shared instance data
within the shared arena, where multiple <A HREF="3334_L0_.html">object records
</A>share a common arena record. In this case each object is associated
with a unique process and is not considered an alias.
<P>
Each<B> VMAL</B> is identified by a unique handle referred to as the <A HREF="3347_L0_.html">hal</A>.
