<H1>Descriptor Tables</H1><!-- entering slot 30 -->
<P>
There are three tables which hold descriptors.
<P>
The three tables are:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Global Descriptor Table or GDT, describes
memory objects which are accessible to all processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
GDT is located by means of a hardware register called the GDTR which contains
the linear address and length of the GDT.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Local Descriptor Table or LDT, describes
memory objects which are unique to one process or are shared among a few
processes by design.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The LDT is located by means
of a hardware register called the LDTR which contains a selector.  The descriptor
referenced by this selector must be a system descriptor which describes
an LDT.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Interrupt Descriptor Table or IDT, has gates
that specify interrupt handler entry points.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
IDT is located by means of a hardware register called the IDTR which contains
the linear address and length of the IDT.  The interrupt number is used
to index into this table when an interrupt occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
