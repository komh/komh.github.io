<P>
In protected mode, all storage is described by the hardware, using tables
maintained by the software. The description includes the location, and size
of the storage segment, as well as the type of storage. The storage type
further constrains how it may be used. 
<P>
This section concentrates on the selector part of the address because the
offset is handled in a very simple and consistent fashion once the memory
segment has been located and the validity of the access has been verified.
