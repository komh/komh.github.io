<H1>Involuntary Suspension</H1><!-- entering slot 209 -->
<P>
In this section we discuss the mechanisms involved when a thread involuntarily
gives up CPU processing time. That is, another thread independently causes
a thread not to receive or to give up its time-slice.
<P>
The mechanisms available that cause suspension are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pre-emption<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Another thread of a high priority becomes
ready.
<P>
The suspended thread becomes ready and the pre-empting thread runs.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Pre-emption is not possible when running in kernel-mode (specifically when
<B>InDos</B> is non-zero, which is set shortly after entry to the kernel).
Within the kernel co-operative multi-tasking operates: threads must yield
explicitly (call the scheduler) to give up the processor.  This applies
equally to device drivers and file system drivers, which also run in kernel
mode. Physical Device Drivers may use<B> DevHlp_Yield</B> and<B> DevHlp_TCYield
</B> to give up the processor to other threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Critical
Section<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Another thread in the same process enters
critical section.
<P>
The critical section thread runs and none of the other threads will run
except if a signal 'fires'. If another ready thead in the same process is
selected by the dispatcher for running it is held on a temporary queue with
its status set to<B> crt</B>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The Critical Section thread has<B> run</B> status.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DosSuspendThread
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>Another thread in the same process has issued DosSuspendThread.

<P>
The suspending thread runs and the suspended thread enters<B> frz</B> state.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Freeze Process<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Either a
Session Manager switch is in progress, a new process has been created suspended,
 a Virtual Device Driver has called the VDHFreezeVDM helper routine or the
DosDebug DBG_C_Freeze command has been executed against a debugee process.

<P>
The frozen process has a state of<B> frz</B> in all its threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Voluntary suspension is indicated by the<B> blk</B> state.
<P>
When a thread is suspended involuntarily it will normally be in one of the
following states:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
rdy<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Ready and waiting to run.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> crt
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Ready but prohibited from dispatch by a critical
section thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> frz<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Frozen
or Suspended by freeze-process or DosSuspendThread.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
The remaining six thread states related to transient system processing on
behalf of a thread. These are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
dly<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Delayed wake-up. Multiple threads have been
woken from a blocked state because they were all waiting on the same BlockId
and a multiple wake-up was specified to ProcRun.  Each delayed thread is
queued pending scheduling where priority recalculation and the thread's
ring 0 stack is checked for presence in memory. If all is well then the
thread is placed on the ready queue pending dispatch. If not, then the thread
is placed on the TSD Daemon's queue for paging in the thread's TSD (ring
0 stack).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> tsd<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The thread
is on the TSD Daemon's queue waiting for ring 0 stack page-in. The Daemon
runs as an internal thread, which is labelled *tsd by the<B> .P</B> command.
This thread is responsible for calling the page manager to page in a thread's
TSD. Because a paging operation involves I/O and is therefore relatively
slow, this operation is performed under the control of a separate thread.
This allows other threads to be processed<!-- entering slot 210 --> while
the paging operation takes place.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> gsk<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Get
Stack request in progress. The TSD Daemon is waiting for the Page Manager
to signal completion of the paging I/O operation. Effectively a thread in
this state is blocked waiting for completion of a TSD paging I/O request.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>bst<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Boosted Ready State.
 When the TSD page-in completes successfully, the thread is placed on the
dispatchers ready queue with a priority boost.  This condition is indicated
by the boosted ready state. Strictly speaking this is not an independent
state since no operation is required to take the thread from<B> bst</B> to
<B>rdy</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> bad<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> TSD page-in
request has failed. This is a serious and terminal condition, which is not
expected to occur. It is possible that an I/O error has occurred during
the TSD page-in request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ---<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The
null state occurs very fleetingly during thread creation and termination.
It signifies that the thread's environment is incomplete.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
