<H1>Steps to Diagnose a Wait</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->
<P>
Waits are recognized by the fact that no thread is ready. If the scope of
the problem is a single application, we need only find out which thread
is expected to run, and then analyse why it will not. If we cannot find
out which thread we expect to run, we will need to do the analysis for each
thread in the process, which will take somewhat more effort.  Frequently,
the application can be removed by using the window list to end it.  If this
has been attempted, and has not worked, one must find out why thread 1 will
not execute.
<P>
If the scope of the problem is the user interface, one needs to examine
it, as discussed above.  The workplace shell is discussed elsewhere; remember
that from the kernel's viewpoint, it is 'just another application'.  This
used to be a much more common symptom than in relatively current releases.
It was typically noticed on a LAN server, when requesters received normal
service responses, but the system administrator could not use the keyboard
or mouse.
<P>
Frequently, if you haven't a well defined place to start, it works reasonably
often to look at the blocking data for all threads, and to choose a resource
which is needed by many threads.  Pragmatically, if that resource could
be made available, many threads would unblock. Therefore, choose one of
the more 'popular' block ID's, and proceed to find out what thread owns
it, why that thread will not run, and so on. You may need to do this for
only one or two resources before you discover the key thread, and can focus
your efforts on it.
<P>
If the scope of the problem is that OS/2 refuses to run any thread, the
problem must be extremely basic, for example, the drive containing SWAPPER.DAT
is no longer available due to a hardware problem, or the system has actually
terminated, but has been unable to display that fact.
