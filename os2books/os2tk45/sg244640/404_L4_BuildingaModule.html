<P>
To trace only public procedures, you only need your MAP file that was generated
by linking your module.
<P>
To trace local variables in C language routines, compile the C programs
with the debug option and assemble the ASM routines with public symbols.
 Link all the OBJs together with the debug option (/CO) and run TRCUST on
the executable module. You can now strip the debug information from the
executable file by either relinking the OBJs without the debug option or
by using the <A HREF="443_L2_UsingtheDEBDELUtilit.html">DEBDEL</A> tool
to delete the debug information from the executable module file.
