<H1>Virtual Address Space Arenas and Regions</H1><!-- entering slot 154 -->
<P>
OS/2 partitions the 4G virtual address space into three types of arena:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
System<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Shared<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Private<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
The system arena is common to all processes.  It starts at the 512M boundary
and occupies the address space up to 4G.  Only system code (and device drivers)
can access data in the system arena directly. User code must use APIs invoked
by the call gate mechanism to access system arena code and data. Nearly
all system arena data is global: that is, managed by a common set of page
tables, whatever the current thread/process context. The exception to this
is in the memory area mapped by selector 30. Page table entries are adjusted
as part of context switching so that selector 30 addresses the current PTDA,
TCB and TSD. 
<P>
The shared arena address range is common to all processes, but it comprises
data that is both global and instance. Instance data occurs where a separate
set of page table entries are used per context to map the same linear address
range. 
<P>
Instance data is used when the same type of data needs to be allocated as
multiple private copies to each process.  An example of this would be a
logical screen buffer.  The shared arena starts initially at the 304M boundary
and ends at 512M.  User programs may access the shared arena.  DLL code
and data is located in the shared arena.  DLL code segments are always global,
but DLL data segments may be instance or global and are usually a mixture
of both.
<P>
The shared arena is further subdivided into a number of regions:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>Region</I><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL><I> Description</I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Protected
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>This region is reserved for protected data segments
of protected DLLs. In General 16- and 32-bit applications do not have addressability
above the 448Mb boundary. Potentially 32-bit applications are able to modify
all read/write global data, whether intended by the owning DLL or not. The
Protected region is provided so that Protected DLLs can isolate their data
from general access. Only Protected DLLs have addressability to the protected
region by being assigned data selector 63.
<P>
32-bit DLLs become protected through use of the protect option at compile
time.
<P>
16-bit DLLs may also use the protected region, if explicitly coded to do
so and listed in CONFIG.SYS using:
<PRE>   PROTECT16=dll1,dll2,....</PRE>

<P>
The Protected Region may be subsumed into the Based Region (see below) by
coding in CONFIG.SYS the<B> NOPROTECT</B> option on the<B> MEMMAN</B> statement.

<P>
The default is<B> MEMMAN=PROTECT</B>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
From OS/2 Warp V3.0 fix pack 19 and OS/2 Warp V4.0, the Protected Regon
has been absorbed into the Based Region. The system bahaves as if<B> MEMMAN=NOPROTECT
</B>is in effect and<B> MEMMAN=PROTECT</B> has no effect.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Based
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>The Based Region is reserved for non-protected DLLs
that have a preferential base address assigned by the linkage editor by
using the<B> BASE</B> option.
<P>
The purpose of the Based Region is to improve performance of module loading,
by avoiding the need for the System Loader to do fix-up processing.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Under OS/2 2.x,<B> MEMMAN=NOPROTECT</B> would cause the Based and Packed
Regions to move up 64M bytes - effectively giving another 64M bytes for
general purpose use in the Shared<!-- entering slot 155 --> Arena.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Packed
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>The Packed Region is reserved for 16-bit DLL code
segments. Within the Packed Region the <A HREF="3306_L0_.html">Compatibility
Region Mapping Algorithm</A> does not apply. Code segments are packed contiguously
to make best use of physical pages.
<P>
Potentially, tiny DLL code segments can deplete physical storage very rapidly
if not packed. However, when packing is used there is no general algorithm
that will convert 16-bit addresses into 32-bit addresses within the Packed
Region. The system has to scan the <A HREF="3332_L0_.html">LDT</A>, over
the Packed Region, to make this conversion.
<P>
Packing may be disabled by specifying the<B> NOPACK</B> option of the<B> MEMMAN
</B>statement in CONFIG.SYS. The default is<B> PACK</B>. When packing is
disabled up to 32M bytes is made available to the Global Shared Region.

<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
Under OS/2 2.x only<B> MEMMAN=NOPACK</B> would tend to reduce the Swapper
Size where a great many 16-bit code segments are in use. This is because
code segments outside the Packed Region are normally discardable (they are
not swapped). Within the packed region they are swappable since a 4K page
may contain code from a number of different modules.
<P>
Under OS/2 2.x<B> MEMMAN=NOPACK</B> would provide up to 32M bytes extra
virtual address space for general purpose use in the Shared Arena.
<P>
Packing does not affect the availability of LDT selectors for allocations
in the Packed Region, just the base linear address boundaries on which they
are deployed.
<P>
Packing should not be confused with either the LINK386 PACK option or the
PACK.EXE utility.
<P>
From OS/2 Warp V3.0 fix pack 19 and OS/2 Warp V4.0 the packed region has
been reduced to 16Mb.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Global
Shared<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> This region has a lower boundary at 320M
bytes and includes the Packed, Based and Protected Regions.  This is reserved
for Global Read-Only allocations only.  Since no Read/Write data is allocated
in the Global Shared Region some page table economies are possible. Also
process context switching performance is improved.
<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
The Global Shared Region is not configurable.
<P>
The Global Shared Region is only implemented in OS/2 WARP version 3.
<P>
Under OS/2 2.x Read/Write segments would be allocated in the Based Region.
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Read/Write Basing<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> The
Read/Write Basing region is the preferred region for locating Read/Write
DLL data segments where a base address has been assigned to a DLL module
by the linkage editor. The purpose of this region is to keep Read/Write
segments out of the Global Shared Region and thus retain its performance
advantages. It also places an upper bound on the location of dynamic shared
allocations, namely the Minimum Read/Write Basing Region address.
<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
The Read/Write Basing Region is not defined in OS/2 versions prior to version
3.
<P>
Based DLLs under OS/2 2.x, by preference, have their segments loaded sequentially
starting with segment 1 at the base address. With the implementation of
the Global Shared Region only Read-Only segments can be loaded sequentially
from the base address.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Expansion
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>The Shared Arena is an<I> expand-down</I> arena,
that is, allocation searches for free regions from the high addresses to
low. The Shared Arena therefore expands from the minimum Read/Write Basing
Region address towards the highest upper bound of all the<!-- entering slot 156 --> Private
Arenas. This area is the expansion region for both the Shared Arena and
all the Private Arenas.
<P>
The Shared Arena will not contract to an address higher than the minimum
Read/Write Basing address.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The expansion region for OS/2 2.x is from the lower boundary of the Packed
Region, if present. If not, then from the lower boundary of the Protected
Region, if present. If both the Protected and Packed Regions are removed
(using MEMMAN=NOPACK,NOPROTECT) then expansion occurs from the top of the
Shared Arena.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Each private arena occupies the lowest range of virtual address space from
0 - 64M bytes expanding up to a maximum of 304M bytes, the minimum Read/Write
Basing address. None of the Private Arenas will be allowed to expand beyond
the lowest allocation in the Shared Arena, that is Private and Shared Arenas
may not overlap.
<P>
In general each process uses a separate set of page table entries to map
each page of its private arena.  Thus the data in the private arena is private
to each process.  Code (.EXE files) however is treated differently.  Since
code is read only an economy is made whenever more than one process runs
the same .EXE. Where this happens the same page table entries are used among
the processes sharing the common .EXE file.  User programs may only access
the private arena of the process they are running in (a special exception
to this is possible through the DosDebug API by defining memory aliases).
 
<P>
Virtual Memory Arenas and Regions may be presented pictorially as in the
following diagram.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Some regions of the 4G address space are reserved. This is done for a variety
of reasons which include:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
H/W and BIOS restrictions<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Enforced segregation between Arenas<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Guaranteed reserved address ranges.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
