<H1>Typical Instructions</H1><!-- entering slot 53 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> CL,DH
<P>
The opcode is 'MOV', the first operand is the CL register, and the second
operand is the DH register. This instruction will copy (MOVe) all 8 bits
from the DH register to the CL register.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> DX,8

<P>
The opcode is 'MOV', the first operand is the DX register, the second operand
is the immediate value of 8.  This instruction puts the value 8 into the
DX register.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> EBP,ESP

<P>
Again, the opcode is 'MOV', and the instruction will copy all 32 bits of
ESP into EBP.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> AX,BX

<P>
You should be able to tell by now that this instruction will copy 16 bits
from BX to AX.  Note that instructions which reference only registers are
extremely unlikely to cause an exception.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> AX,word
ptr [BX]
<P>
This instruction is different from the one above because there are brackets
around the second operand.  This means that the operand, BX in this case,
is in storage, and the BX register holds the offset into the DS segment.
If BX is outside the limit of the DS segment, a general protection fault
will occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> word ptr
[BX],AX
<P>
This instruction is similar to the preceeding one, but moves data into storage,
rather than from storage. The same exceptions might occur, and if the DS
segment is read-only, this instruction would also fail.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MOV
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>word ptr ES:[BX],DI
<P>
This is an example of overriding the default segment, DS, by explicitly
specifying that the offset in the BX register applies to the ES segment.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADD<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> word ptr DS:[BP],AX

<P>
This would add the 16 bits from AX into storage at DS:BP, developing the
sum directly in storage.  The override is needed because the use of BP means
that the default segment is SS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DEC<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> word
ptr [BP-2]
<P>
Some instructions have only one operand.  In this case it is in storage
at an offset calculated by subtracting 2 from the BP value, in the segment
defined by the SS register, because BP is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Also  SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, XCHG, INC, SHL, etc.
<P>
It is extremely common for 16-bit code to use FAR addresses.  When they
are in storage, it would require several instructions to get a FAR address
into the registers, if it were not for several instructions whose purpose
is specifically to fetch a FAR address from storage into a selector and
another register. These instructions may be recognized by the opcode, which
is the letter 'L' followed by a selector register name other than CS. The
apparent first operand is the general, base, or index register which will
hold the offset part of the far address. Both registers will be loaded,
with the first operand coming from the address specified, and the selector
coming from the following word.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
LES<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> BX,dword ptr [BP+6]<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This instruction loads BOTH BX and ES. BX comes from BP+6 and ES comes from
BP+8, both in the stack segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
LDS<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> SI,dword ptr [BP-12]<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This instruction loads BOTH SI and DS, SI is loaded from BP-12 and DS is
loaded from BP-10.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
LEA<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> EDI,[EBP+ECX*4-12]
<P>
Load Effective Address DOES NOT actually reference storage. Instead, once
the offset has been calculated, it is put into the target register, EDI
in this case.  Address expressions like this are possible, but not often
seen while actually debugging. The scale factor can be 1, 2, 4, or 8; not
any arbitrary value<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
