The examples included in this section are worked on an OS/2 2.11 system.
For OS/2 WARP the same techniques work, however the<B> SFTs</B>, whilest
they may be located from the<B> SAS</B> in the same manner, they are allocated
in segments that are mapped by different selectors. The effect of this is
that short-cut techniques used to locate WARP<B> SFTs</B> may need to be
re-worked. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
