<P>
Problems which are called 'hangs' fall into several categories.
<P>
The term 'hang' has come into use because there is frequently no way for
a user of OS/2 to determine whether the problem is a loop or a wait.  The
term 'hang' is used in a generic way to mean 'the system does not respond
as I expect', or 'I am unable to interact with the system'. The problem
may be a loop, or it may be a wait.
<P>
Diagnosing any 'hang' will likely be much quicker if the system trace was
used to collect appropriate data related to the symptoms.
