<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3621 --><B>Thrashing</B> refers to the state of a system
where most of the CPU time is spent paging in and out memory from the swap
file. This happens when real storage is heavily over committed and storage
references encompass a wide range of virtual pages over a short processing
time.
<P>
Such a condition can indicate a poorly tuned application where paging is
caused by the process of accessing data the application needs. A typical
scenario is where work data is chained in a single, very extended, queue
and no mechanism exits to access the required data without scanning the
entire chain. Use of hashing techniques greatly reduce this problem.
