<H1>Blocking - Voluntary Suspension</H1><!-- entering slot 178 -->
<P>
We now turn our attention to<I> blocking</I>, which the is mechanism that
threads use to give up processor time voluntarily to wait for an event to
occur or a resource to become available.
<P>
The term voluntary is chosen from the perspective of the scheduler and not
necessarily from the application's perspective.  In this context voluntary
suspension refers to an action taken by a thread to give up its time-slice.
 This will include direct actions such as waiting on semaphores as well
as calling APIs, which for internal reasons need to wait for a resource
or an event.
<P>
PROCBLOCK and its counterpart PROCRUN are the two kernel routines at the
heart of the block/run mechanism. These are callable directly by kernel
component and also by Device Drivers and File System Drivers through a small
interface layer. Application code only gets to call PROCBLOCK and PROCRUN
indirectly through system APIs and in particular through the semaphore APIs.

<P>
The block/run mechanism is designed with the following criteria:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
A thread should be able to block without the waking thread having to know
whether anyone, or who, had blocked on a resource<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Multiple threads should be able to wake when an event or resource becomes
available.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This is achieved by having an abstract token, known as the<B> Block ID</B>,
associated with the resource or event. The BlockId is passed to PROCBLOCK
when a thread blocks. Similarly when another thread wishes to wake threads
waiting for a resource or event the BlockId that represents the resource
or event is passed to PROCRUN.
<P>
In addition to the BlockId, callers of PROCRUN receive a flag that indicates
whether all or just the highest priority thread waiting on the BlockId should
wake.
<P>
This mechanism has shortcomings unless certain constraints are applied:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
BlockIds need to be subject to a convention that gives uniqueness otherwise
it is possible that threads will incorrectly block and run. A solution is
to use the address of a control block memory object that relates uniquely
to the resource or event.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If addresses are to be used for BlockIds then they must point to global
data for reasons of uniqueness. Furthermore, if they are to be reference
by disabled code then the storage needs to be in resident memory. This more
or less implies that addresses must be taken from within the System Arena.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If BlockIds are in use that do not represent addresses then they must not
conflict with any potential addresses used as BlockIds.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Even if addresses are use there is no accounting information that says who
owns the related resource.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A workable scheme is implemented by limiting the direct use of PROCBLOCK
and PROCRUN to system code, device drivers and file system drivers, all
of which have access to the System Arena.
<P>
Apart from three special conventions the system and most device drivers
use addresses as BlockIds. There are three system defined conventional BlockIds
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
fffe....<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> results from a RAMSEM wait.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> fffd....
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>results from a MUXWAIT.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ffca....
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>results from a Child Wait<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> x.......
(x=a - f)<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Linear address of the memory object of
control block that relates to the resource.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ........
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Probably selector:offset address of the memory
object or control block that relates to the resource.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This scheme could be subverted by device drivers,<!-- entering slot 179 --> but
in general they will choose to block on addresses of resources they own,
which are usually allocated out of the system arena and addressed using
a GDT select:offset.
<P>
Accountability remains an exposure. For BlockIds that are addresses the
owner of the memory that the BlockId points to gives a big clue. For conventional
BlockIds we have to do more work. These are discussed in detail later. We
will first we look at an example of a BlockId that is an address.
<P>
<U><I>Basic Technique:</I></U>
<P>
The technique for analysing blocked threads is two-pronged:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We can look at the wait from the application
perspective by examining the current user registers and by trying to identify
the API issued. This is usually relatively easy but often gives no clue
as to the underlying wait since any single API may block on many occasions
for many reasons.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Examine the problem from the Internal, or Kernel
perspective to determine what an API might be waiting for. This process
starts with finding the associated BlockId.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When a thread blocks its BlockId is stored in the TCB TCBSleepId field.
Conveniently, this is formatted by using the<B> .PB</B> KDB and DF command.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
.PB under DF lists non-blocked threads. BlockIds are irrelevant for such
threads.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
<LI>PB also attempts to interpret the BlockId. The full details of these
are given in the <A HREF="262_L1_KernelDebuggerandDum.html">Kernel Debugger
and Dump Formatter Command Reference</A>. In addition to classifying the
BlockId, .PB examines TCB_SemInfo and TCB_SemDebugAddr.
<P>
For many semaphore originated BlockIds TCB_SemInfo is used to store the
address or handle of the user's semaphore that lead to the thread blocking.
.PB will attempt to locate a near symbol to the semaphore address and display
it.
<P>
Under the kernel Debugger, TCB_SemDebugAddr is used to store the address
of the caller to the Semaphore API when the thread blocked. If this field
is not 0xffffffff .PB attempts to locate a near symbol to the caller and
display it.
<P>
Once we have the BlockId, TCB_SemInfo, and TCB_SemDebugAddr we are able
to begin searching for information associated with reason for blocking.

<P>
The next step is to decide whether the BlockId is one of the three special
categories or to be treated as an address.
