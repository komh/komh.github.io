<P>
The Dump Formatter is an interactive line-mode utility that supports a variety
of commands for extracting and displaying information from a system dump.
There are two versions of the Dump Formatter:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>df_ret.exe</B><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> The Dump Formatter for dumps from
systems running either the<B> RETAIL</B> or<B> HSTRICT</B> kernels.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> df_deb.exe
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>The Dump Formatter for dumps from systems running
the<B> ALLSTRICT</B> kernel.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Refer to the <A HREF="214_L1_KernelDebuggerUserGu.html">Kernel
Debugger User Guide</A> for a discussion on the different OS/2 Kernels.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Each of the two Dump Formatters is generated for each build of the OS/2
kernel. Thus the Dump Formatter is system level and fix-pack level dependent,
in a similar way to the debug kernels. Several base versions of the Dump
Formatters are distributed with the<B> OS2PDP</B> package. Versions of the
Dump Formatter that apply to a particular fix-pack may be obtained from
the following sources:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

The Dump Formatter has a named pipe interface that allow it to be controlled
from another program. This is exploited by the PMDF program, which is also
distributed with the OS2PDP package.

PMDF provides:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

The command set supported by Dump Formatter is very similar to that of the
Kernel Debugger. In many cases they share common commands. These are documented
in the <A HREF="262_L1_KernelDebuggerandDum.html">Kernel Debugger and Dump
Formatter Command Reference</A>.
