<H1>An Example of Using the Stack</H1><!-- entering slot 78 -->
<P>
This is a trivial example of how to pass and receive parameters, which is
used to document where the stack pointer and base pointer are at the end
of each instruction.
<P>
The example is 32-bit non-optimized code.
<P>
The subroutine, SUB, is designed to return the difference obtained by subtracting
the second parameter from the first.
<PRE>First, the relevant C code:

(  main  )                 ( sub )
    .
z=sub(A,B);                int sub(int x, int y)
    .                        {
    .                        return x-y;
    .                        }

Next, the assembler code

    .          ( i ) initial condition
  PUSH B     ; (01)             SUB:    PUSH EBP         ; (04)
  PUSH A     ; (02)                     MOV  EBP,ESP     ; (05)
  CALL SUB   ; (03)                     SUB  ESP,nn      ; (06)
  ADD  ESP,8 ; (12)                      .
  MOV  Z,EAX ; ( f ) final condition     .   ( NOTE )
                                         .
                                        MOV  EAX,[EBP+8] ; (07)
                                        SUB  EAX,[EBP+12] ; (08)
                                         .
                                        MOV  ESP,EBP       (09)
                                        POP  EBP           (10)
                                        RET                (11)

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> At this point, the stack frame is established. If another,
lower-level routine is called, the code to do so will look like the code
seen in main, and a new stack frame will be established by that routine
as soon as it receives control.
<P>
The new frame will be just below the current one.
