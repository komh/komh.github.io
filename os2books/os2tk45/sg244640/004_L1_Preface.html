<P>
Debugging problems is essentially an iterative process of hypothesis, test
and conclusion that aims to eliminate the irrelevant and therefore focus
on the probable causal area.
<P>
To engage this process successfully one needs to be equipped with an innate
ability to think laterally coupled with sufficient knowledge of the environment
in which the problem persists and above all else to be able to use the tools
that extract information from the system under diagnosis.
<P>
This scenario applies as much to first level problem determination (PD)
as it does to the software developer who is engaged in detailed analysis
of his programs' behaviour.
<P>
Information and tools to aid first level problem determination is relatively
accessible. Technical literature is available from IBM and books stores
that will fulfil the needs of the first level PD analyst. For example, the
reader is invited to consult the following IBM Red-book publications to
achieve an all-round high-level technical appreciation of the OS/2 environment:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The Technical Compendium Volume 1 - Control Program<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Technical Compendium Volume 2 - DOS and Windows Environment<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Technical Compendium Volume 3 - Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Technical Compendium Volume 4 - Application Development<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Technical Compendium Volume 5 - The Print Sub-system<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
The problem analysis level that is less well provided for is that which
involves internal knowledge of the OS/2 operating system and its diagnostic
tools.  This is the level at which Service personnel, System Programmers
and Software Developers work. It is this audience to which the OS/2 Debugging
Handbooks are directed.
<P>
An inevitable consequence of working at a deep technical level is that the
amount of information one could amass is vast. Given time constraints and
the need to publish useable material before it became obsolete we had to
make certain compromises for the first edition. The following principles
guided us in making decisions about which material to include:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Material that is adequately documented elsewhere is referenced but not included.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Accurate reference documentation for the diagnostic tools and facilities
available for OS/2 has been given priority over worked examples and OS/2
Internals reference material.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Internals information has centred around the base operating system - that
is, the kernel.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
We hope to remedy some of these short-comings in future revisions of this
book and in companion volumes. Updates to the on-line version of this book
will be made available via the Developer Connection CDROM. 
<P>
The current printed edition contains full reference material for the following
OS/2 System diagnostic facilities:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
System Trace<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
System Dump<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Kernel Debugger<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to these topics we have included an introductory<!-- entering slot 11 --> guide
to problem determination. This provides a resum√© of the hardware and software
environment and an introduction to using the dump formatter and kernel debugger.

<P>
Throughout this book we assume the availability of and familiarity with
two co-requisite publications:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
The Intel Pentium Family User's Manual, Volume 3: Architecture and programming
manual, ISBN 1-55512-227-2, Intel order number 241430-003.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This
should be consulted as the authoritative source for hardware architectural
information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The Design of OS/2 by H.M. Deitel and
M.S. Kogan.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This should be consulted for an overview
of the internal operation and architecture of OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This book is supplied with a CDROM whose contents are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Sample exercises to accompany <A HREF="011_L1_ApproachtoProblemSol.html">Volume
1, Introduction to Debugging.</A> These take the form of system dumps of
typical problems in application programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On-line version of this book. This is slightly  more
up-to-date than the printed version and includes more worked examples. This
is an<B> .INF</B> file and should be viewed using the OS/2<B> VIEW.EXE</B> program.
Much use has been made of<B> hypertext</B> links, which direct the user
to the glossary. From the glossary it is possible to link to related material
in other sections of the book.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OS/2 Problem Determination Package (OS2PDP), which
includes the dump formatter, symbol files, and trace customiser (<B>TRCUST</B>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Unless otherwise stated the material in this book may be assumed to be applicable
to OS/2 Warp version 3.0 (ALLSTRICT Kernel).
<P>
As indicated above, work on this subject matter can never be complete. We
intend build on and update the material in this edition. In order to address
the areas in most need of attention we invite the reader to fill in the
Reader's Comment Form with their suggestions.
