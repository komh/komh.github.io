<P>
Since the modem communicates with the MUT at 9600 bps, but can communicate
with the remote modem at any speed, the modem must use flow control to avoid
data overruns.  The only flow control supported by the debug kernel is <A HREF="230_L3_ControllingOutputtot.html">XON/XOFF</A>.
The only problem this causes is when the remote user wants to pause a continuous
data display by pressing CTRL-S.  If the modem has also sent a CTRL-S, the
one from the user will be ignored.  You may have to press CTRL-S several
times before the display pauses.  This is not a problem if the remote user's
communications program supports a "scroll-back buffer," in which case there
is no reason to pause the display with CTRL-S.
