<P>
If a 9600 bps modem is not available, a slower modem can be used with the
debug kernel.  If the modem supports "speed conversion" (a 2400 bps modem
with error-correction and compression will support speed conversion), setup
is straightforward.  Construct the proper initialisation string for the
modem, making sure that the modem's DTE speed (modem-to-debugger) speed
is locked at 9600 bps.  If the modem does not support "speed conversion,"
construct an initialisation string for the modem, and create a<B> KDB.INI
</B>file that resets the debugger to the speed supported by the modem.  For
example,<B> .B 2400t 2</B> for a 2400 bps modem.  In this case, the person
calling the debugger will have to use the speed supported by the modem.
