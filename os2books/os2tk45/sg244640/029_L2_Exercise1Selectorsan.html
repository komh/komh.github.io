<H1>Exercise 1: Selectors and Descriptors</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
Objectives:<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Learn how to load a dump for analysis<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Introduction to the dump formatter<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Learn how to display descriptors<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Start
the lab at a full-screen or windowed command prompt.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
A full-screen session is faster, but a windowed session can be made 100
lines high by entering<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
MODE CO80,100 This can be very useful, because you can look back quite a
ways by using the scroll bar.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Change to directory CLASSES\UTIL<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Make diskette one by typing OS2IMAGE ..\IMAGES.162\LAB01.001 A:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Make diskette two by typing OS2IMAGE ..\IMAGES.162\LAB01.002 A:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Load the dump into a new file which will be named DUMP1.DMP by typing<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DCOMP
A:  X:\DUMP01.DMP  and pressing enter, then following the prompts.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
When the dump is loaded, it should have a file size of 4194816.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Start the dump formatter by typing  DF_RET X:\DUMP01.DMP,<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
or by   DF_RET ..\DUMPS.162\DUMP01.DMP
<P>
You should see 6 or 7 informational lines at the top, followed by a pair
of lines which start "Slot", and "*0023#", followed by a set of registers.
***  We are not yet concerned with any of these.  ***
<P>
You should get a prompt, which is the character "#".<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> You can always document what you are thinking by simply typing
it in as an evaluation for the dump formatter to perform. You can access
the evaluation function by typing ?' followed by whatever you want echoed
to the screen and to the log.  You can also type in ? and any expression
to have it evaluated and output in hex, decimal, octal(!), binary, character,
and boolean forms.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> ? by itself is a simple request for what commands are recognized.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Use the dump formatter to look at descriptors and answer these questions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The dump formatter is NOT case sensitive.
<P>
Descriptors may be displayed using "DG" or "DL", followed by the selector.
Try it both ways for several selectors, such as F, 160, DFFF, 158.
<P>
Use the miniature command reference in the back of the student guide, if
necessary.
<P>
There are a great many things we will NOT do in this exercise.  We are using
only a tiny part of the dump formatter's capabilities for this class. For
example, we will ignore the IDT in this class; one can enter "DI" followed
by the interrupt number to see the descriptor from the IDT.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>
<P>
Questions to answer:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>  1.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Which
table contains the descriptor data for selector 000F? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL>

<UL> Which command is preferred to display only the
descriptor for 000F? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

alternative command will also display only the descriptor for 000F? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>What type of memory is described by selector 000F?
