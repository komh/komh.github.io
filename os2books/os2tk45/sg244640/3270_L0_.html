<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3585 -->A<B> task</B> is hardware architected thread
of execution. The INTEL architecture allows for multiple independent tasks
to co-exit and provides the <A HREF="3271_L0_.html">task gate</A> mechanism
as a means of switching between tasks. Tasks are represented to the hardware
by the <A HREF="3275_L0_.html">TSS</A>.
<P>
The characteristics of a<B> task</B> are very similar to that of the OS/2
<A HREF="3318_L0_.html">process</A>. Protect-mode processes however, tend
to run under a single task in OS/2 and implement switching through the more
efficient software managed <A HREF="3284_L0_.html">context</A> switching
mechanism.
<P>
Only <A HREF="3272_L0_.html">VDMs</A> and error recovery processes run as
independent<B> tasks</B>.

See the<B> INTEL486 Programmer's Reference</B> for more information.
