<P>
TRACEBUF=x
<P>
TRACEBUF sets the size of the trace buffer in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
The parameter 'x' specifies a circular trace buffer size of up to 63K. If
you have a TRACEBUF statement without a TRACE statement in CONFIG.SYS, the
trace buffer size requested is specified and tracing is turned off (the
same as if you specify TRACE=OFF).
<P>
If you need to use the System Trace facility, use the largest size, if possible.
 TRACEBUF=63
<P>
TRACEFMT displays formatted trace records in reverse time-stamp order. It
is intended to be used to format the trace data so that you can analyse
the content of the trace buffer. The most recent entry is displayed first.
TRACEFMT numbers each event as it is formatted. The event numbers are unrelated
to the trace data, and are useful when discussing a trace with someone else,
for easy reference to events.
<P>
TRACEFMT works without a filename only if you have a trace buffer defined
in the running system.
<P>
TRACEFMT works with a filename only if the file is a hex image of a trace
buffer from a system for which you have Trace Formatting Files. If the .TFF
file is not correct, the entries which are different will be formatted incorrectly
with little or no indication of an error.
<P>
The file is typically created by the dump formatter by using the command
'.TS filename', but TRACEFMT will also save the trace buffer in unformatted
form. This is much smaller than the formatted form.
