<P>
When you look at a 16-bit map file, you will discover that it may have at
least three sections.  A 32-bit map file can have at least 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The first section is built in the same sequence
as the executable.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The second section contains a list of all external
symbols, sorted by the name of the symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> This
is particularly useful when a programmer wants to find where some particular
variable or routine is located.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The third section contains a list of the same
symbols, sorted by the location of the symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> This
is particularly useful when you know where something is, and want to find
out if it has an external name, or what routine encompasses the address
of interest.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The fourth section of a 32-bit map file contains
a list of locations where the compiled code for each input line begins.
 This can tell you almost immediately which line of code failed, once you
know which program, and where within the program the failing instruction
was located.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
