The kernel comprises an number of internal components, each responsible
for a different aspect of running the system. It also has a number of interfaces
that provides services to applications, device drivers and file systems.

These aspects are now considered in a little more detail and are summarised
in the diagram shown under: <A HREF="3116_L3_TheOS2KernelsInterfa.html">The
