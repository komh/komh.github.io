<H1>Invoking TRCUST to Process a TSF file.</H1><!-- entering slot 577 -->
<P>
The syntax for processing a TSF file is as follows:
<PRE>
   [d:][path]TRCUST [d:][path]tsf [[d:][path]tdf] [/M=mapfile] [/Wn] [/D]
                    [/L=loadmod] [/NODE] [/NOLN] [/RMn] [/RSnnn] [/I] [/P]
                    [/PREINV] [/RAS]

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
TRCUST<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the name of the Trace Customizer program. A drive and path may optionally
be specified to explicitly define the location of the Trace Customizer program,
otherwise the program is searched for in the current directory, followed
by looking along the path defined by the PATH environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tsf
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the name of the trace source file. If no file extension is provided then
an extension of TSF is assumed. If no path is provided the trace source
file is searched for in the current directory, followed by using the current
value of DPATH.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tdf<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)
<P>
 is the name of the trace definition file to store the dynamic tracepoint
definitions. If not specified, the TSF filename is used with an extension
of TDF. If no file extension is provided then an extension of TDF is assumed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>/D<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)
<P>
allows duplicate minor codes to be used. This is useful where there is no
need to distinguish different tracepoints which create records of the same
format. For exmaple, multiple return points from a subroutine.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /I
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
allows case-insensitive references to MAP file symbols to be used in TSF
TRACE statements.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /L=loadmod<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
specifies the load module path and file name to be read by TRCUST. If not
specified TRCUST uses the specification in the MODNAME statement of the
TSF. If no path information is given in the MODNAME statement TRCUST assumes
uses current directory and DPATH to locate the load module.
<P>
MODNAME is required by the TRACE command to allow it to load and determine
the traced module's handle. /L is useful in cases where the load module
is built using a name that differs from the installed name or where path
information is required on the MODNAME statement for the TRACE command which
differs from the directory used when the TDF is built. See also the<B> /P
</B>switch for TRCUST.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /M=mapfile<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)
<P>
 defines<I> mapfile</I> as the MAP file for this module. The name may be
qualified by a drive/directory, otherwise it will be searched for in the
current directory followed by the path specified by the DPATH environment
variable. If specified as an option, the MAP file must exist and the filename
extension must be MAP or TRCUST will abort processing. The mapfile will
only be used if a symbol is not found in the symbolic debug information
stored in the executable module.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /NODE<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
forces TRCUST to ignore debugging information even if present. This is provided
for cases where<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
a)  the user wishes to use MAP symbols in preference to debugging information.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
b)  the level of debugging information in not supported by TRCUST and errors
are produces if it is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B> Note: </B>
<P>
Debugging information is not a public standard. Some compilers may  appear
to emulate supported styles of symbolic debugging information while not
 actually doing so.
<P>
TRCUST supports the following debugging information styles:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
IBM C and C6 CodeView NB00 and NB02 styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
IBM CSet/2 HLL version NB03 style.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
IBM CSet/2++ and IBM VisualAge V1 to V3 HLL version NB04 styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
IBM ALP assembler Debugging Informaion (HLL version NB04).<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
Any compiler or assembler that conforms to the HLL NB00 - NB04 debugging
information styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /NOLN
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
forces TRCUST to ignore module line number records but honor any other debugging
informantion present. This option is provided for cases where line number
information does not conform to supported specifications and causes unpredictable
results. Currenty TRCUST is limited to supporting no more then 64K of line
number information. For<!-- entering slot 578 --> exceedingly large source
files this limit could be exceeded.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
/NODE implies /NOLN<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /P<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
allows the path information specified with MODNAME to be retained in the
TDF. The default is to strip path information from the module name. With
no path information the TRACE command will rely on PATH, LIBPATH or the
command line specification to the TRACE command to locate the traced module.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>/PREINV<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)
<P>
allows a tracepoint to be placed after the MOV (E)BP,(E)SP instruction on
entry to a routine where local variable references will be valid. This is
intended for use where local data refences are made from the TSF, but the
tracepoint is definied by reference to the routine's MAP file symbol name.
In general it is better to use number references since /PREINV relies on
the style of code generated by the compiler used. See <A HREF="414_L4_TPKeyword.html"><B>name
</B>specification</A> of the TP statement for information on difference
between MAP file symbol references and symbolic debugging information references.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> PREINV does not search for the equivalent ENTER instruction.
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>/RAS<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
allows major code 0 trace definitions to be generated.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Major code 0 is reserved by the system for system trace internal
processing. The /RAS option should not be used except for the express purpose
for which it is intended.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /RMn
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
specifies the mode by which the RETEP keyword of the TSF TRACE statement
will operate. Eight modes of RETEP operation are defined as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->Disallow RETEP tracepoints.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->determine the RETEP tracepoint directly from CodeView
symbol records only.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use mode 1 then search for a LEAVE+RET  or POP EBP
instruction sequences near the end of the traced routine.
<P>
This is the default RETEP processing mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use mode 2 then search for an isolated LEAVE instruction
near the end of the traced routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use mode 2 then search for an isolated RET instruction
near the end of the traced routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use modes 2 and 3 combined.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Version 2.0 of TRCUST only uses this search mode but is less
reliable than mode 2 alone.<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Warning:</B>
<P>
Use of RETEP can run the risk of having a tracepoint not generated on an
insruction boundary. The result of which would be unpredictable and probably
cause the traced program to trap. This risk is grealty reduced by allowing
the RETEP mode to default to<B> /RM2</B>. If the user chooses to widen the
RETEP criteria then appropriate validation of the resulting tracepoints
must be made.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use mode 4 then search for
an isolated JMP instruction near the end of the traced routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->use mode 6 but search for an isolated LEAVE instruction
near the end of the traced routine, before searching for JMP.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Successful location of return tracepoints can only be guaranteed with unoptimised
IBM C and C6 CodeView information where the return point is given explicitely.
More advanced compilers do not necessarily generate a single return point.
They may even generate common epilog code for multiple routines hence the
following limitations should be noted:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
Only the last return from a routine is located.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
Only mode 1 can accurately determine the last return, however this is only
available to code-view version 0 modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
<!-- entering slot 579 -->Searching for instruction sequences may result
in a tracepoint erroneously being placed within an instruction.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
It may not be possible to use RETEP to define the return tracepoint for
modules that  use private (particularly optimised) calling conventions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
The default mode is 2. This reasonably safe. Higher modes are less safe.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
Use mode 5 for compatible behaviour with earlier versions of TRCUST. However,
note that earlier versions of TRCUST erroneously permit certain tracepoints
which are not permitted using mode 5.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
To avoid possible errors, JMP instructions with opcode 0xff are not selected
in modes 6 and 7.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> For an alternative method of specifying
return tracepoints refer to the TP keyword of the TSF TRACE statement and
how to use source line number references.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /RP
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
modifies RETEP processing to allow Pascal Return instructions (RET n) to
be included in the search criteria for return tracepoint location. Use this
with 16-bit code where you know that pascal returns are generated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /RSnnn
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
specifies how far RETEP will search from the end of a routine to find the
return instruction sequence.  This defaults to 18 bytes however RETEP will
not search before the start of the routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Wn
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>(optional)
<P>
is the level of error messages to be displayed, where<B> n</B> can be 0,
1, or 2.  The possible message levels are shown below along with the messages
that each displays:
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->fatal and severe messages<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<BR>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->fatal, severe, and error messages<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<BR>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->all (fatal, severe, error, and warning) messages
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
A message level of 2 is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
