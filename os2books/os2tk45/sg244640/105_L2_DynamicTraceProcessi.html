<P>
Dynamic tracepoints are implemented as Trace Definition File (TDF) entries.
The TRACE command can be used to insert (and turn on) a dynamic tracepoint
by patching it into its corresponding software module.  Dynamic tracepoints
are specified by the dynamic link library (DLL) filename and  minor code.

<P>
Individual dynamic tracepoints can be qualified by separate type and group
qualifiers.  These qualifiers exist so that you can more easily turn on
and off sets of related dynamic tracepoints.  For example, all the dynamic
tracepoints that are associated with pre-invocation events might have a
type of PRE.  Similarly, all the dynamic tracepoints that are involved in
semaphore processing might have a group of SEM.  In the TRACE command syntax,
group is considered to have a stronger binding than type.  This means that
you can ask to turn on all events that are of a specified group that are
also of one or more specified types. You do not need to use these qualifiers;
they are there simply to make it easier to control related sets of dynamic
tracepoints.
<P>
TDF files are typically found in the \OS2\SYSTEM\TRACE directory. They are
identified by .TDF file name extensions. There are also Trace Formatting
Files (TFF) found within that directory.  These files are used by the OS/2
Trace Formatter (TRACEFMT) utility to format the entries that are logged
within the system trace buffer.
