<H1>Kernel Debugger User Guide</H1><!-- entering slot 320 -->
<P>
The Kernel Debugger is essentially a replacement OS/2 Kernel module that
contains an in-built <A HREF="3249_L0_.html">debugger</A> component. With
the debugger one may halt system execution, inspect and alter memory and
registers and display system control blocks. The debugger is controlled
from a dump ASCII terminal (the debugging console) which is connected to
the machine under test (MUT), either directly or via a modem-modem link,
through one of its COMx ports. The debugger supports a comprehensive command
set, which is fully described in the <A HREF="262_L1_KernelDebuggerandDum.html">Kernel
Debugger and Dump Formatter  Command Reference</A>.
<P>
The debug kernel is distributed in two forms:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>ALLSTRICT</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This version of the kernel contains
all optional self diagnostic (otherwise known as strict or assertion checking)
code. Besides this functional difference many of the system control blocks
have extra accounting and signature fields. This has a number of consequences
that may affect problem diagnosis:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Performance characteristics will be different since
extra checking and acounting is being performed.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Memory useage will be different because of extra
diagnostic code, extensions to system control blocks and in some cases additional
space to cause page faults rather than overlays by erroneous code.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Timing critical problems might not be re-createable
under the<B> ALLSTRICT</B> kernel.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Secondary problems may be detected or even introduced
through the use of additional diagnostic code.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> HSTRICT
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>This version of the kernel is essential the
<B>RETAIL</B> kernel with the debugger component. It contains only a limited
set of strict checking code.  The system control blocks are of the same
form as those used by in the<B> RETAIL</B>  kernel. The performance characteristics
of the<B> HSTRICT</B> kernel are closer to those of the<B> RETAIL</B> kernel
than the<B> ALLSTRICT</B> kernel. For this reason the<B> HSTRICT</B> kernel
is recommended as a first choice when diagnosing application and non-system
problems.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The base version of the<B> ALLSTRICT</B> kernel is distributed with the
<B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B>. Versions of the<B> HSTRICT</B> and<B> ALLSTRICT
</B>kernels for fix packs may be obtained from the following sources:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OS/2 Base Product CDROM for WARP is distributed
with the<B> ALLSTRICT</B> kernel and Dump Formatter. (For the initial release
of WARP this was only available on the US version of WARP).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

The Kernel Debugger packages obtainable from the SDM are equipped with an
installation procedure and two text files<B> dbsetup.txt</B> and<B> modemset.txt

remote debugging via a modem.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
