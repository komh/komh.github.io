<P>
The OS/2 Trace facility is an important RAS mechanism within the OS/2 product.
 It allows specific events within the operating system, in system extensions
and in applications to be recorded in a circular System Trace buffer.  Software
developers can create tracepoints that are used to monitor the execution
of their software modules.  A tracepoint is in essence a "window" that can
be used to "peek" into a software module whenever that module reaches the
state that corresponds to the tracepoint.
<P>
The OS/2 Trace facility includes three important utility programs:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

used to control (that is,  enable and disable) the tracing of individual
events.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> The
<A HREF="395_L1_DynamicTraceCustomis.html">Dynamic Trace Customiser</A> is
used to define both dynamic tracepoints for .DLL modules and trace formatting
files for use by<B> TRACEFMT</B> utility.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>The Trace Formatter</A> is used to format the
contents of the sytem trace buffer for viewing. It may also be used for
saving both formatted and unformatted trace data in a disk file and therefore
may be used with the Dump Formatter <A HREF="388_L3_TDumptheSystemTraceB.html">.TS
