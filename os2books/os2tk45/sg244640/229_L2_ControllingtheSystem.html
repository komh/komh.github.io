<H1>Controlling the System From the Debugging Console</H1><!-- entering slot 338 -->
<P>
Having set up the Kernel Debugger for a <A HREF="215_L2_KernelDebuggerLocalS.html">Local
</A>or <A HREF="219_L2_KernelDebuggerRemote.html">Remote</A> debug session
the system is ready to be controlled from the debugging console. The console
is used in two modes, which for convenience we refer to as:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Monitor mode, and<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Command mode<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In Monitor mode the console acts merely as a output device for displaying
diagnostic messages from the debug kernel and debug versions any other of
system modules that write messages to the debugger's COM port. In this mode
it is not possible to enter <A HREF="262_L1_KernelDebuggerandDum.html">Kernel
Debugger commands</A> without having first switched to command mode. In
monitor mode the system runs more or less as a retail system except for
the performance overheads imparted by the additional diagnostic code.
<P>
Monitor mode is in effect initially unless a <A HREF="218_L3_TheKDBINIInitialisat.html">KDB.INI
</A>file is defined.
<P>
The console switches to monitor mode after <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G command
</A>is executed.
<P>
In Command mode normal system execution is suspended. The debug component
of the kernel monitors the debugging console for command input and indicates
this with using one of the following command prompts:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<B>&gt;</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> Signifies that the system has been suspended
while in real mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> #</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> Signifies
that the system has been suspended while in protect mode with paging disabled.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>-</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> Signifies that the
system has been suspended while in V86 mode with paging disabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> ##
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Signifies that the system has been suspended
while in protect mode with paging enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> --
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Signifies that the system has been suspended
while in V86 mode with paging enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to these prompts the Kernel Debugger also uses a data prompt
when a commands require additional input. This is signified by a single
colon prompt<B> :</B>. Commands such as <A HREF="309_L3_RSetorDisplayCurrent.html">R
</A>and <A HREF="297_L3_EEnterDataIntoMemory.html">E</A> may use a data
prompt.
<P>
Command mode is entered when one of the following events occur:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
A fatal exception while executing in ring 0<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Any
unrecoverable exception occurring in a device driver, file system driver
or the OS/2 kernel will result in a fatal error if it is allowed to be intercepted
by the system exception handlers. When this occurs it is usually not possible
to restore the system to a running state.
<P>
The <A HREF="313_L3_VExceptionTrapFaultV.html">VTF command</A> may be used
to intercept potentially fatal exceptions before the system's exception
handlers receive control. If the exception condition is corrected manually
then the system may continue to run after the <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G
command</A> is entered. See <A HREF="240_L2_TrapandExceptionProc.html">Trap
and Exception Processing</A> for further information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> An
Internal Processing Error (IPE) occurs.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Internal
processing errors are unrecoverable conditions that are detected by the
OS/2 kernel. Some of these are exceptions (described in the previous bullet);
others are inconsistencies that arise from invalid logical conditions or
invalid system data. Under the retail kernel IPEs result in the system halting.
Under the debug kernel the console enters command mode after an error message
is displayed. IPE messages may be suppressed from displaying as a hard error
popups by setting the byte at symbol:<B> fDebugOnly</B> to a non-zero value.
Under the debug kernel some IPEs are generated for recoverable conditions
and allow the system to continue execution after the <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G
command</A> is entered. An example of a recoverable IPE is where the loader
detects a<I> bad</I> or mismatched symbol file for a module it is loading.
When this occurs the system displays message:
<PRE>    Internal Symbol Error</PRE>

<P>
Command mode is entered. If the<B> G</B> command is subsequently issued
the system will be allowed to continue execution without the<I> bad</I> symbol
file being activated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> A<I><!-- entering slot 339 --> sticky
</I><A HREF="3286_L0_.html">breakpoint</A> fires<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL><I> Sticky
</I>breakpoints are set using the <A HREF="280_L3_BPSetorAlteraBreakpo.html">BP
</A>and <A HREF="281_L3_BRSetorAlteraDebugRe.html">BR</A> commands. The
system is may be returned to a running state after the <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G
command</A> is entered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> An unhandled non-maskable
interrupt (NMI).<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> NMIs normally signal hardware
error conditions. Under the RETAIL kernel these usually result in TRAP 2
fatal exceptions unless an NMI handler has been registered by a device driver.
Under the debug kernel, unhandled NMIs cause control to be given to the
debugging console from which it is possible to return the system to a running
state using the <A HREF="299_L3_GGo.html">G command</A>.
<P>
NMIs are may be generated from several sources, which include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
Channel Check<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This occurs when an I/O card activates
the channel check signal.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Memory parity error<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This
occurs when memory capable of parity bit generation, detects a parity discrepancy
as memory is fetched from RAM.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> DMA bus time-out.
<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL>This occurs when a DMA-driven device uses the bus
for longer than the maximum allowed period of 7.8 microseconds.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> The
watchdog timer interrupt.<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This occurs when the
NMI watchdog (NWD) is enabled and timer interrupts (IRQ 0) are disabled
causing loss of timer ticks. OS/2 maintains an NWD count, which If exceeds
a maximum value then an IPE is generated. Some hardware/BIOS also maintains
an NWD counter, but the precise details of the NWD mechanism are machine
specific. For some systems the NWD may not be supported. For further information
refer to the appropriate hardware and BIOS reference literature for the
machine type under consideration.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Unless the NMI
is masked off using by setting mask bit 0x80 in I/O port 0x70, the NMI channel
check provides a means of breaking into the system even when it is disabled
for (maskable) interrupts, that is, when the<B> CLI</B> instruction has
been used to clear the interrupt flag in the<B> EFLAGS</B> register. An
an ISA-bus system a prototype card may be used to implement the following
circuit, which provides an NMI push-button switch:
<PRE>               (-IOCHK)
         A1  ────────────┐
                         │
                           ├─   (NMI Push switch)
                         │
         B1  ────────────┘
               (Ground)


</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
OS/2 normally only disables NMIs during system initialisation and when the
Kernel Debugger is running in command mode. However, the Kernel Debugger
will allow only one attempt to break in using a channel check NMI, after
which NMIs are disabled until the system is re-booted.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> An
<B>INT 3</B> instruction is executed<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL><B> INT 3</B> instructions
are used by the system to implement tracing (see <A HREF="389_L1_SystemTraceFacilityU.html">The
System Trace Facility</A>) and software <A HREF="3286_L0_.html">breakpoints</A>.
However any program may use<B> INT 3</B> instructions freely under the Kernel
Debugger to cause system execution to be suspended and the debugging console
to switch to command mode.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Under the<B> RETAIL</B> kernel,<B> INT 3</B> instructions other than those
<!-- entering slot 340 -->implemented by the system for tracing cause code
to be terminated with a TRAP 3 exception.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
user enters<B> Ctrl-C</B> from the debugging console.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Unless
the system is in a disabled state, the user may type<B> Ctrl-C</B> from
the debugging console at any time to cause immediate suspension of normal
system execution and the console to switch to command mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
user holds down the<B> r-key</B> from the debugging console at system initialisation
time.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> If the<B> r-key</B> is held down at system
initialisation time the debugging console will switch to command mode shortly
after the OS2KRNL has entered real-mode for the first time. At this time
no symbols have been loaded, paging has never been enabled and the<B> KDB.INI
</B>file has not been processed.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
In real-mode many of the Kernel Debugger external commands are not available
(because the rely on Virtual Memory Management to be initialised). Attempts
to use them may cause unpredictable results or even total system failure.
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The holds down the<B> p-key</B> at
the debugging console at system initialisation time.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> If
the<B> p-key</B> is held down at system initialisation time the debugging
console will switch to command mode shortly after the OS2KRNL has entered
protect-mode for the first time. At this time no symbols have been loaded,
paging is disabled and the<B> KDB.INI</B> file has not been processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
user holds down the<B> Space-bar</B> from the debugging console at system
initialisation time.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> If the<B> space-bar</B> is
held down at system initialisation time the debugging console will switch
to command mode shortly after the OS2KRNL has entered protect-mode and fully
initialised. At this time OS2KRNL symbols have been loaded and paging is
enabled but the<B> KDB.INI</B> file has not been processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The
<A HREF="218_L3_TheKDBINIInitialisat.html">KDB.INI</A> file is processed.
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>If the<B> KDB.INI</B> file is present then the
Kernel Debugger effectively enters command mode by executing Kernel Debugger
commands from the<B> KDB.INI</B> file. After the last command is executed,
the command prompt appears at the debugging console, unless that last command
was a<B> G</B> command.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
