<H1>Suspension and Freezing</H1><!-- entering slot 215 -->
<P>
Suspension is achieved by any thread in a process calling DosSuspendThread.
There is no accounting information associated with this API. One must examine
all threads in the process to see if they are functioning correctly.
<P>
Freezing occurs for a number of reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
A new process has been created with the thread initially suspended.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
The Session Manager (Shell Process 1) has used DosSystemService to freeze
all threads of a process while a screen group switch occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A Virtual Device Driver has called VDHFreezeVDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A Debug thread has called DosDebug using the DBG_C_Freeze command.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Again, there is no accounting information kept for this state.
<P>
If a single thread exists in the frozen process, check the parent process's
threads for correct functioning.
<P>
If all threads are frozen check the Shell Process 1 for correct processing.
