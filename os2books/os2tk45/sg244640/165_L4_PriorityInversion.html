<H1>Priority Inversion</H1><!-- entering slot 216 -->
<P>
Priority Inversion is a hybrid situation that involves both the involuntary
and voluntary suspension of two threads.
<P>
Consider the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
A high priority thread is blocked on a resource.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A low priority thread owns the resource on which the high priority thread
is blocked.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
An independent thread of intermediate priority is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>

<P>
Thread 1 will not run until thread 2 gets a time-slice that allows it to
run and release the semaphore thread 1 is waiting for.
<P>
Since thread 3 is a higher priority than thread 2 and is CPU bound, thread
2 never runs, nor does thread 1.
<P>
Thread 1's priority has effectively been reduced to that of thread 2's by
a lower priority thread - thread 3. Thread 1 is said to have its priority
inverted with respect to thread 3.
<P>
The Kernel implements an automatic inversion protection mechanism whenever
a process blocks using a KSEM. Essentially this amounts to boosting the
KSEM owner's thread priority by setting TCBPriorityMin to be just greater
than the waiter's priority. This mechanism is implemented by the following
three routines:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
TKEnterInversion<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Called to protect against priority
inversion.  For example, when a mutex KSEM is obtained increments TCBcBoostLock.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>TKExitInversion<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> When an
inversion protected KSEM is released TCBcboostlock is decremented.  When
TCBcBoostlock is zero and TCBPriorityMin and is not zero then it is set
to zero and the priority recalculated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TKDeclareInversion
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Used to set the minimum priority of a thread to
be waited on.  If owner's TCBPriorityMin &lt; waiter's TCBPriority and owner
is in ready state then the owner's TCBPriorityMin to the waiter's TCBPriority+1.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For this mechanism to work, it must be possible to determine ownership from
the semaphore so that TKDeclareInversion can determine which thread's priority
to alter.  It is also necessary to be able to determine whether raising
the priority of thread will lead to other synchronisation problems or deadlocks
through race conditions. Since the Kernel is a special case, and because
pre-emption cannot occur while running in kernel mode, the kernel limits
inversion protection to the KSEM only. Outside kernel mode, inversion is
automatically protected against (for regular and foreground server threads)
by application of the starvation priority boost.
