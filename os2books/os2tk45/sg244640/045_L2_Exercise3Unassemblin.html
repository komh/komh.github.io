We will now look at instructions.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In what type of segment are instructions found?
 <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Are instructions EVER executed in any other segment
type? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unassemble the instructions which would have
been next to execute ( if the application hadn't trapped ) by entering "U".
 The default address is CS:IP initially.  You can unassemble further with
repeated use of "U".  To unassemble at a particular place, specify the address;
for example CS:IP. <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->What was the next instruction which would have
executed? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unassemble using an address range to see some
previous instructions. Type "U CS:IP-20 IP-10".  This will unassemble from
ip-20 to ip-10. Now type "U CS:IP-21 IP-10" and "U CS:IP-22 IP-10. Observe
what is happening by closely observing the address at which each instruction
begins. <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Now type "U CS:IP-18 IP" to see the TWO instructions
immediately before the failing instruction<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ( at
CS:IP! ). What are they? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Which one loaded the address used in the next
(failing) instruction? <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Did the address come from this routine's private
data, or was it a parameter passed by the caller?<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> This
is presented in detail later. <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Circumstantially at least, what seems to be wrong?
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Also presented later.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
