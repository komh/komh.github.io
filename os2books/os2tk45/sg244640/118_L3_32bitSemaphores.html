<P>
There are two classes of 32-bit semaphores, private and shared. There are
three types of semaphore in each class, Event, MUTual EXclusion, and multiple
wait semaphores.
<P>
MUTEX semaphores correspond to one of the most common uses of the 16-bit
semaphores, namely to allow competing threads to mutually exclude others
from accessing a shared resource.
<P>
A MUTEX semaphore includes the slot number of its owner, if owned, or zero
if unowned.
<P>
An EVENT semaphore contains a 'post count' which is incremented each time
it is POSTED, and decremented each time a WAIT for it is completed successfully.
 This type provides a way to insure that some processing occurs exactly
once for each POST.
<P>
A multiple wait semaphore is nothing more than a list of semaphores, of
the same type.  A thread may wait on either 'ANY' or 'ALL' of the semaphores
in the list.
<P>
All Semaphores must first be created with DosCreate???Sem, where '???' is
the semaphore type. Other processes must open them with DosOpen???Sem to
have access to them.  Private semaphores have a null pointer to their name,
and thus no name. Public ones have a name in the same format as that used
for the 16-bit semaphores. DosClose???Sem is used when a thread is through
using it.
<P>
DosRequestMutexSem and DosReleaseMutexSem are used to access the mutual
exclusion semaphores.
<P>
DosPostEventSem and DosWaitEventSem are used to access an event semaphore.
DosResetEventSem will allow immediate access, and return the post count,
which is cleared by this API.
<P>
DosQuery???Sem will allow the retrieval of information about each type of
semaphore.
<P>
DosAddMuxWaitSem and DosDeleteMuxWaitSem are used to add and delete semaphores
from a multiple wait semaphore list, respectively.
