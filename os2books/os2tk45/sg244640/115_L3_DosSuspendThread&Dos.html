<H1>DosSuspendThread & DosResumeThread</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
Some applications are designed such that there is a limited number of threads
which will access some shared resource, and others never will.
<P>
To access a resource in a protected way, one can simply suspend the other
threads which represent a possibility of simultaneous update, and leave
the remaining threads alone.  This is therefore less intrusive than the
critical section API's, but still may affect threads which do not represent
a threat at this instant, due to other processing, timing, and so on.
<P>
DosSuspendThread API will cause a specific thread to no longer compete for
the processor, until DosResumeThread is issued.  A thread in this situation
will have the status of 'frz'.  It may not be possible, without an appropriate
trace, to find out which thread suspended another.
