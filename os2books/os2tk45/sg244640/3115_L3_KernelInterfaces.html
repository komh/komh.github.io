<H1>Kernel Interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 3354 -->
<P>
The Kernel provides the following external interfaces:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Application (R3/2) Interface.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Application access
kernel services via GDT call gates. These are called either directly from
the application program or via the DOSCALL1.DLL module, where additional
Ring 3 processing is required before calling the kernel. Some system interfaces
are able to be implemented entirely within Ring 2/3. In these cases, DOSCALL1.DLL
does not make any kernel calls.
<P>
The kernel interfaces are represented by a fictitious module called DOSCALLS.DLL.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>File System Driver (FSD)<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
FSDs run in ring 0 as separately loaded modules. They are provided a set
of interfaces to the kernel via the FSD_Hlp (File System Helper) calls.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Physical Device Driver (PDD)<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The
PDDs run in ring 0 as separately loaded modules. They are provided a set
a interfaces to the kernel via the Dev_Hlp (Device Helper) calls. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Virtual
Device Driver (VDD)<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The VDDs run in ring 0 as separately
loaded modules. They are provided a set a interfaces to the kernel via the
VDD_Hlp (Virtual Device Driver Helper) calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Compatibility
BIOS<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The compatibility BIOS resides within the
OS2LDR module. It provides a hardware implementation independent layer through
which the kernel access the BIOS. The interface to the CBIOS from the kernel
is provided by the Dos_Hlp (Dos Helper Services). These are not available
for access by PDDs, VDDs or FSDs, however a limited set of Dos_Hlp calls
are provided via the TESTCFG.SYS and OEMHLP$ device drivers.
<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
OEMHLP$ is not a separately loaded module - it is resident within the OS2LDR
module. 
<P>
OS2LDR is responsible for loading the Kernel at system initialisation time.
It does not get involved with the loading of Application Programs, PDDs,
VDDs for FSDs during normal running - that function is performed by the
System Loader component of the Kernel.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
