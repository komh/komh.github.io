<H1>Aliasing</H1><!-- entering slot 170 -->
<P>
The situation described thus far can be further complicated by a technique
known as aliasing. This is where one or more pages of an object may be mapped
by page table manipulation to one or more pages of another object. In effect,
this is partial object sharing.
<P>
This can occur between processes or within a process and is usually done
for the following reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
A device driver needs to create an I/O buffer to receive data at interrupt
time and therefore in any context. The application that called the device
driver also needs to have access to the results. This is commonly solved
by the device driver making a <A HREF="3328_L0_.html">UVIRT</A> allocation
in the system arena which aliases an application data buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A debugging application needs to access or even modify data and code of
the debugee. This is achieved through CS and DS selector aliasing.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A Dos Virtual Machine needs to simulate the A20 line wrap-around. Storage
addressed above the A20 line aliases to addresses module 2**20.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A Dos Virtual Machine's Private Arena address space is aliased in the system
arena so that it may be accessed by Virtual Device Drivers in a context
other than that of the VDM. The VDM handle (HVMD) is the alias address,
which the VDD may add to any Private Arena Address to obtain a context independent
access to a location in a given VDM.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These situations require the introduction of another memory management control
block: the Alias Record (<B>VMAL</B>). Each VMAL has a unique handle or
<B>hal</B>, which is the table entry from which the<B> VMAL</B> is allocated.

<P>
Where aliasing occurs, the handle to the alias record (<B>hal</B>) is saved
in the VMAR of the aliasing address range.
<P>
In the case of memory aliasing the VMAL contains the handle to the PTDA
of the aliasing process.
<P>
In the case of CS/DS aliasing within a process the VMAL contains the CS
selector.
<P>
The link field of the VMAR is used to link together aliasing and aliased
address ranges.
<P>
Alias records may be formatted using the<B> .ML</B> command as shown in
the following example:
