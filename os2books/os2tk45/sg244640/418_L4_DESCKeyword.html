<H1>DESC Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 598 -->The DESC parameter is used to produce a description
for the tracepoint that is output as the first line of formatted data. It
should include the entry point name of the procedure being traced and whether
this is an entry or return point. The descriptive string is enclosed in
double quotes as for a C language string. The DESC parameter is required
if any FMT specifications are present.
<P>
The recommended formats for such strings are as follows:
<PRE>        DESC="<I>name</I> Pre-Invocation",

        DESC="<I>name</I> Post-Invocation",
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
name<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the system component (in parentheses) followed by the entry point name
of the procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Pre-Invocation<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
identifies this tracepoint as an entry point, that is, before the function
has been executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Post-Invocation<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
identifies this tracepoint as a return point from the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The words<I> Pre-Invocation</I> and<I> Post-Invocation</I> are not mandatory,
merely recommendations to be compatible with the base OS/2 tracepoints,
when formatted. If a tracepoint is inserted in the middle of a procedure
it will be appropriate to use different wording. The Trace Customizer does
not check the wording.
<P>
An example of pre-invocation and post-invocation tracepoints follow:
<PRE>      TRACE  MINOR=0x0001,             TP=.DosOpen,
             DESC="(OS) DosOpen    Pre-Invocation",.....

      TRACE  MINOR=0x8001,
             TP=.DosOpen,RETEP,
             DESC="(OS) DosOpen    Post-Invocation",.....
</PRE>
