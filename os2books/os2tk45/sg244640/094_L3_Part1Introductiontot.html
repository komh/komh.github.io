</UL>  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Execute
OSPREY, see the failure, and the trap screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> At
the failure, record CS:EIP from the trap screen.
<P>
CS _________   EIP _____________
<P>
At this point, it is too late to cause a dump. Dismiss the trap screen.

<P>
We will refer to the system on which the problem occurs at the Machine Under
Test, or the MUT.  The MUT is connected via a null modem cable to an adjacent
machine, which we will call the debug terminal. Most of the debugging actions
will occur from the debug terminal, on which we will run a public domain
terminal emulation program, LOGICOMM.  If you like LOGICOMM and intend to
use it frequently, you should register it, which will also get you an improved
version.
<P>
Let's use the debug kernel for the first time. First, we need to get its
attention.  The way to do this is to enter Control-C on the debug terminal,
after starting LOGICOMM.  The debug kernel defaults to settings
<BR>
   9600, N , 8, 1
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Start LOGICOMM on the debug terminal, then type
Control-C.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> The default response of the debug kernel
is the registers at whatever point OS/2 was interrupted by the Control-C.
 This is not generally very useful.  We need to get control where we want
it, not at a random place.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enter the command  VSF*<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> This
tells the debug kernel that you want control on any interupt which may be
Fatal to a thread.  The 'F' is for fatal, the '*' is for 'any'.
<P>
Enter the command G    (Go), so OS/2 can continue.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the MUT, rerun OSPREY.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> This
time, you should get a group of lines on the debug terminal which tell you
that a fatal failure has occurred.
<P>
Enter the command   DG CS    You will find that this is in ring 0.
<P>
Before we look at ring 0, let us find where ring 3 called ring 0, and also
identify the API which was called.
<P>
Enter the command   .R   (the period is very significant!)
<P>
.R shows you the ring 3 registers, whereas R shows you the current ones.

We already know this instruction did not trap; the trap is in ring 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<P>
If you enter the LN command with the values of CS and EIP from the call
gate, you will identify the API which is called via this gate.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We know how to find parameters on the ring 3
stack,  DW SS:SP<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> We can also find them on the ring
0 stack, but at this point, the kernel has already manipulated some of the
addresses, so there is not an exact match.  We need to get control at the
point of the call at 1BBE.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enter the command  GT   which will GoThrough
the trap.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
