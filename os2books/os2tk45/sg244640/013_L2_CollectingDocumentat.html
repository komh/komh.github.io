<H1>Collecting Documentation</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
If the problem can be reliably reproduced in a development environment,
do it. This is the fastest way to get the problem fixed. When you cannot,
try to get a good set of starting documentation.
<P>
It is possible to acquire and install a replacement for the OS/2 kernel
which is the same as the one being replaced, except that it has debugging
facilities and a debug interface to a serial port, COM2. If you install
the wrong debug kernel, no one can predict the results. If you install the
correct version, you will need to have a terminal emulation program (or
ASCII terminal) to access the debug interface.  The capabilities of this
debug tool are essentially unlimited, and there is no protection from accidental
entry errors. Its use is not a trivial task, nor one to be lightly undertaken.

<P>
It is often possible to collect enough information about a problem to diagnose
its cause by creating customized trace entries specifically for that particular
problem.  For this to work well, the problem must be reproducable, and the
trace buffer must be captured while the data gathered is still present.

<P>
Most people who have worked in a technical support role will agree that
often the largest obstacle to solving a problem is collecting enough useful
information about it. We will briefly discuss how to get enough useful data
that problem solving can start in most cases. Be aware that frequently there
will be some additional useful information, which can be gathered when the
need for it is discovered, and that what is outlined here is not a complete
list, by any means.
<P>
It is important to collect as complete a set of volatile data as possible
from a single failure. If it is not gathered, it will be lost, perhaps requiring
another occurrance of the problem in order to get needed information.
<P>
It is generally possible to use either an interactive debugger or a dump
to diagnose either traps or hangs in an application.
<P>
For application problems, particularly traps, a good set of documentation
includes the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A statement of what sequence of events leads to the
problem<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The trap screen, if a trap is involved<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A storage dump, with system trace data<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->All the executable modules involved in the failure
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Optional application documentation, including:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->all source files<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><LI>map files, produced by the linker<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><LI>lst and .cod or .asm files, produced by the compiler
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The storage dump is the only thing which is volatile. The rest can be collected
whenever the need is discovered.  To collect the first item, perform the
following steps:
<P>
<B>Note: </B> THIS WILL DRASTICALLY CHANGE OS/2 BEHAVIOUR WHEN A TRAP OCCURS.
OS/2 WILL not CONTROL THE FAILURE, BUT WILL INSTANTLY AND IRREVOKABLY STOP
THE SYSTEM, AND INITIATE A STORAGE DUMP.  THERE WILL BE NO<!-- entering slot 21 --> SHUTDOWN
OF THE WORKPLACE SHELL, DATABASES, FILE SYSTEMS, (or lazy-write buffers,)
OR ANYTHING ELSE.  IT CAN BE AS DISRUPTIVE AS A POWER FAILURE. IT IS POSSIBLE
TO LOSE FILES, OR PARTS OF FILES, but unlikely.
<P>
Prior to WARP: execute the command CREATEDD A: This will prepare a diskette
for taking a dump. The diskette will work only once. This is not required
for WARP, nor for later levels of 2.11.  A quick way to discover if it is
required is to read the prompt which asks for the diskette at the beginning
of the process.  If CREATEDD is required, the prompt asks for the diskette
prepared by CREATEDD, otherwise it asks for a formatted diskette.

Preparation:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 a.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

which reads TRAPDUMP=ON<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
</UL>  b.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

a line which reads TRACEBUF=63 to enable the system trace<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

c.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>add a line which reads TRACE=ON to turn on the

<UL>optionally,
add a line which reads TRACE=OFF,4,6,7<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

3.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Locate some formatted diskettes to use for a storage
dump.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Estimate about 2 Megabytes of RAM per diskette;
usually one diskette more than that number is needed.  For very large systems,
estimate 1.5 meg per diskette. The dump process WILL NOT format.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Reboot the system so that the changes take effect.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restore the original CONFIG.SYS, so you do not
have to reboot an extra time to put things back to normal, after collecting
the dump.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

insert the first formatted diskette.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

every time you hear one or more beeps.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you cannot read the screen, you can still
successfully get a dump, by listening for a beep. Insert the next diskette
every time you hear a single short beep.  When the dump is almost complete,
there will be a very distinctively different series of beeps. At this point,
reinsert the first diskette.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

the dump will complete. Remove the diskette.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
