<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3651 -->The<B> Per-Task Data Area (PTDA)</B> is the anchor
point for all process (task) related control information. One PTDA exists
per process and from it is located the <A HREF="3332_L0_.html">LDT</A>,
<A HREF="3345_L0_.html">TCB</A> chain, Page tables and <A HREF="3336_L0_.html">Arena
Headers</A> for a process.
<P>
All active PTDAs are addressable, whatever the current process, from a global
address in the system arena.  However, for the current process an alias
address is created using selector 30 and in addition the many of the PTDA
field names are declared as public symbols.  This allows the fields names
in the PTDA for the current process to be referred to directly under the
Kernel Debugger and Dump Formatter.
<P>
<B>PTDA_Start</B> is the symbol assigned to the beginning of the current
<B>PTDA.</B> Using the <A HREF="274_L3_ShowInternalCommandH.html">? command
</A>against this and other PTDA field names allows relative offsets for
PTDA fields to be calculated and used in other <A HREF="3284_L0_.html">contexts
</A>as offsets from the global PTDA address.
