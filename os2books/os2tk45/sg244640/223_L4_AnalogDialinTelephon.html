<H1>Analog Dial-in Telephone Line</H1><!-- entering slot 331 -->
<P>
In order to call the modem and connect to the MUT, you will need a standard
voice-grade telephone line that can be direct-dialled. A connection can
be made if the line must go through a switchboard, but it makes it more
difficult for the person doing the debugging.  Digital telephone lines won't
work at all with the modem.
