This publication is intended to help service personnel, system programmers
and software developers to understand the concepts and application of debugging
techniques.  The information in this publication is intended as a supplement
to already published specifications of any programming interfaces that are
provided by IBM Warp OS/2 Version 3.  See the PUBLICATIONS section of the
IBM Programming Announcement for IBM Warp OS/2 Version 3 for more information
about what publications are considered to be product documentation.
<P>
References in this publication to IBM products, programs or services do
not imply that IBM intends to make these available in all countries in which
IBM operates.  Any reference to an IBM product, program, or service is not
intended to state or imply that only IBM's product, program, or service
may be used. Any functionally equivalent program that does not infringe
any of IBM's intellectual property rights may be used instead of the IBM
product, program or service.
<P>
Information in this book was developed in conjunction with use of the equipment
specified, and is limited in application to those specific hardware and
software products and levels.
<P>
IBM may have patents or pending patent applications covering subject matter
in this document.  The furnishing of this document does not give you any
license to these patents.  You can send license inquiries, in writing, to

<P>
The information contained in this document has not been submitted to any
formal IBM test and is distributed AS IS. The use of this information or
the implementation of any of these techniques is a customer responsibility
and depends on the customer's ability to evaluate and integrate them into
the customer's operational environment.  While each item may have been reviewed
by IBM for accuracy in a specific situation, there is no guarantee that
the same or similar results will be obtained elsewhere.  Customers attempting
to adapt these techniques to their own environments do so at their own risk.

<P>
Reference to PTF numbers that have not been released through the normal
distribution process does not imply general availability. The purpose of
including these reference numbers is to alert IBM customers to specific
information relative to the implementation of the PTF when it becomes available
to each customer according to the normal IBM PTF distribution process.
