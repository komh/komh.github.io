<H1>Uniprocessor Method - Disable Interrupts</H1><!-- entering slot 138 -->
<P>
There is a way for privileged code to guarantee serialization in a single-processor
environment, namely to disable interrupts during the actual inspection and
update of the protected resource, and then to enable interrupts promptly.
 The overhead of this method is practically nil, but it is potentially dangerous
because it disables pre-emption, which reduces the responsiveness of the
system to the user.  It also represents a barrier to running successfully
on a multiprocessor, because all other processors are unaffected by this,
and it therefore requires the developer to re-examine parts of a program
which are no longer serialized, but may well be thought to be properly serialized.
