<H1>WinGetMsg Logic</H1><!-- entering slot 279 -->
<P>
<B>WinGetMsg</B> operates essentially as a loop that waits for message activity
and returns messages to the user. Conceptually the application's code acts
as an inverted subroutine of<B> WinGetMsg</B>. This was illustrated in <A HREF="184_L4_ThePMMessagingEnviro.html">The
PM Messaging Environment.</A> 
<P>
These are the essential steps in<B> WinGetMsg</B> processing:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When<B> WinGetMsg</B> wakes, it first unlocks the
System Queue if owned or if it is the<I> active thread</I>.
<P>
The<B> MQ</B> of the current system queue owner is pointed to by<B> pmqsyslock</B>.
This is set to zero if this points to the<B> MQ</B> of the current thread.

<P>
The<B> active thread</B> is the thread that has the right to unlock to system
queue if locked by another thread. Normally this is the thread that manages
the<B> MQ</B> of the window in focus. Normally the thread that has locked
the system queue is the<B> active thread</B>. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The received list is checked.
<P>
If<B> SMSs</B> are queued then each is removed successively and the corresponding
window procedure is called.
<P>
Received messages, that is messages sent via<B> WinSendMsg</B> to this thread,
are not returned by<B> WinGetMsg</B>. The window procedure is called directly.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The application's queue is checked for posted messages.

<P>
If one is found it is dequeued and returned to the application. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If no posted message is found then<B> WinGetMsg</B> tries
to process the system queue. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->We attempt to lock the system queue if free.
<P>
if<B> pmqsyslock</B> is zero it is set to the current thread's<B> MQ</B> address.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the lock was successful then we peek the next system
queue message.
<P>
If the lock was unsuccessful we return to the beginning of the loop and
wait on the message queue semaphore. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the next system message is for this thread then
it is dequeued and returned to the application<B> with the system queue
lock still held</B>.
<P>
The possibility of holding the system queue lock while running in user code
is vital to note. While this happens only<B> active thread</B> can dequeue
a system queue message. The reason for holding the system queue lock is
for performance. It is likely that one system message will be followed by
a sequence for the same thread. If the lock was released, unnecessary processing
on other message queue threads would take place. More recently queued messages
could not be processed out of turn anyway, since the interpretation of a
system message depends upon the outcome of the preceding system message.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the next system message is for another application
then the system queue is unlocked. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The other application is made the current input receiver.

<P>
PM distinguishes between current mouse, keyboard and event receiver.<B> WinGetMsg
</B>makes the other application the current mouse, keyboard or event receiver
depending upon the message category. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finally the other application's message queue semaphore
is posted.<B> WinGetMsg</B> returns to the beginning of its message loop
by waiting on its own message semaphore for more message activity.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
