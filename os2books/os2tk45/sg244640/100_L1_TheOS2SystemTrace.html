<P>
The System Trace facility is used to record a sequence of system events,
function calls, or data in a fixed-size circular buffer as requested by
calls to its API's. The buffer must be allocated during the processing of
CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
If you have a TRACEBUF statement in CONFIG.SYS, a trace buffer is allocated,
allowing you to use the TRACE command successfully later.
<P>
If any valid TRACE statements are in CONFIG.SYS (including TRACE=OFF), a
trace buffer will be allocated for the default size of 4K, if TRACEBUF is
not specified. This means that the statement TRACE=OFF will actually enable
system tracing, which seems counter-intuitive to many people.
<P>
If you do not specify TRACE or TRACEBUF statements in CONFIG.SYS, OS/2 does
not allocate a trace buffer and system tracing is disabled.
<P>
After the trace data is recorded, the trace formatter is used to retrieve
the data from the system trace buffer and present it on your display, and
optionally, to print it, or save it in a file.
