<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3578 -->The term<B> Zombie</B> is used to describe a
terminal condition of a thread or process. There is a strict operating system
definition and two colloquial uses:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The strict system definition refers to a process that
has terminated but whose <A HREF="3335_L0_.html">PTDA</A> has been retained
on the zombie queue (<B>_pPTDAFirstZombie</B>) because the process status
byte (LISEG+0xa) indicates that its parent wishes to collect termination
information through<B> DosWaitChild</B>. The dead child is retained on the
zombie queue until either the parent dies or issues<B> DosWaitChild</B>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Zombie is also commonly used to refer to a terminating
thread or process that has blocked after the application has returned to
the operating system. Usually this implies a problem freeing memory because
one or more pages have been long-term locked by a device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The third use of zombie refers to any process that
is anonymous. Internal thread, VDMs, and terminating threads can be anonymous.
