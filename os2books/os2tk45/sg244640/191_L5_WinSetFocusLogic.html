<H1>WinSetFocus Logic</H1><!-- entering slot 282 --> 
<P>
<B>WinSetFocus</B> has a subtle bearing on message processing since it selects
a new active thread and new current input receivers for system messages.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
Focus may be changed by a third party.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>

<P>
These are the essential steps in<B> WinSetFocus</B> processing: <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>WM_FOCUSCHANGE</B>  is sent to the message thread
losing the focus. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The current window in focus is changed.
<P>
<B>pwndfocus</B> points to the<B> WND</B> of the focus owner. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unlock the system queue if locked.
<P>
The<B> MQ</B> of the current system queue owner is pointed to by<B> pmqsyslock</B>.
This is set to zero if it points to the<B> MQ</B> of the current focus owner.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The target window's message thread is marked as the
new focus owner.
<P>
<B>pmqfocus</B> is set to the address of the new focus owner's<B> MQ</B>.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The target thread's message queue is made the current
mouse and keyboard input receiver.
<P>
<B>pmqMouseWake</B> and<B> pmqKeyWake</B> are set to the address of the
new focus owner's<B> MQ</B>. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The new focus owner's message thread is marked as
the new active thread. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A priority boost is applied to the new focus owner's
message thread. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>WM_FOCUSCHANGE</B> is sent to the message thread
gaining the focus. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
