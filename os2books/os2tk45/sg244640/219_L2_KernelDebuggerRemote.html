<H1>Kernel Debugger Remote Set-up</H1><!-- entering slot 327 -->
<P>
This section describes how to use the kernel debugger remotely, that is
with a modem-modem link between the machine under test (MUT) and the debugging
console.
<P>
The first step is to install the debug kernel and symbols files on the MUT
as described preceding section, <A HREF="215_L2_KernelDebuggerLocalS.html">Kernel
Debugger Local Set-up</A>
<P>
Although the Debug Kernel will work with nearly any modem, configuration
details are unique to each modem.  This topic describes the setup of several
modems, and gives general guidelines for setting up others.
