This section describes how most OS/2 programs use the stack.
<P>
Understanding the stack is generally straightforward. The stack is defined
by the descriptor selected by the Stack Selector register or SS, and the
stack pointer or SP.  Stacks are always read/write. There are two basic
operations on a stack, PUSH and POP.  PUSH decrements the stack pointer
and then stores the operand at the offset provided by SP in the stack segment.
 POP moves the data item at the offset provided by SP to the operand and
then increments SP.  SP ALWAYS POINTS TO THE LAST ITEM PUSHED.  Stacks grow
downward from higher addresses to lower addresses.
