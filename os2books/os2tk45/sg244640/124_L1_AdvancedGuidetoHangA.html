<H1>Advanced Guide to Hang Analysis</H1><!-- entering slot 150 -->
<P>
What is a<I> hang?</I>
<P>
It's an external symptom or a user perception that little or no work is
being done. It could be a case of extremely poor performance. The hang symptom
categorises itself into three distinct cases:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Wait<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Threads and processes are not being dispatched
by the Operatin System. Thread status gives the initial clue. Use of the
<B>.P</B> command determines status.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
Blocking<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> Threads may wait voluntarily for a resource
or an event, in which case they will probably be<B> Blocked</B>.  They might
poll for the resource, in which cases they will cycle through blocking,
being ready and running until the resource becomes available.
<P>
A notoriously problematic case of Blocking is the<B> deadlock</B>. This
is where two threads are each own exclusively a resource and block waiting
for ownership of the other's resource.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Suspension
<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL>Another thread may have deliberately debarred a
thread from being scheduled, in which case we will see the waiting thread
in a<B> crt</B> or<B> frz</B> state.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Pre-emption
<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL>Another thread monopolises the system. Typically
the hanging threads will be ready for dispatch (<B>rdy</B>), but will never
or rarely receive a minimum time-slice. We look for running and ready threads
with an excessively high priority. The <A HREF="378_L3_PDisplayProcessStatu.html"><B>.P
</B></A>will give the calculated priority of each thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> Disabled
wait<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> Looks rather like a H/W Freeze. Last instruction
executed was a<B> HLT</B> having sometime previously disabled interrupts
using<B> CLI</B>. This usually happens only when ring 0 code detects an
terminal condition. One would hope that some form of diagnostic information
had been displayed prior to this particularly if NMIs have been disabled
also! If NMIs have not been disabled then an artificially generated channel
check may be used to cause an NMI, which would allow one to break into the
kernel debugger. However the KDB to allows only one NMI channel check per
boot. If NMIs are disabled then H/W analysis techniques may be the only
recourse.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Loop<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> A
thread is running more or less permanently. It's state will mostly be<B> rdy
</B>or<B> run</B>. Similar analysis techniques to trap apply here. We examine
the registers of the running thread by using <A HREF="384_L3_RDisplayUsersRegiste.html"><B>.R</B></A>.
From the we can determine in which module the thread is running by looking
at the owner of the executing code segment.  If necessary we unwind the
stack and determine the caller etc.. Analysis is very similar to trap analysis.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>H/W Freeze.<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> The processor
fetch-execute cycle has been suspended. Not even an NMI interrupt will resume
instruction fetch. This is almost<!-- entering slot 151 --> certainly a
hardware problem. Timing/clocking problems caused by incompatible cards,
overloaded busses, incorrect bus terminations, faulty processor or controller
chips. Use H/W techniques such an ICE machine or Logic Analyser.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
