<H1>DosGetSTDA (Get The System Trace Data Area)</H1><!-- entering slot 3327 -->
<P>
The<B> DosGetSTDA</B> API is a 16 bit API that returns a copy of the system
trace buffer (STDA). 
<P>
<U><I>Syntax</I></U>
<P>
The following 16 bit C language function prototype can be used to call the
<B>DosGetSTDA</B> API:
<PRE>
   // 16 bit compiler
   extern unsigned far pascal DosGetSTDA( SEL, SHORT, SHORT );

   // 32 bit compiler
   APIRET16 APIENTRY16 DosGetSTDA( SEL, SHORT, SHORT );

         Where:  SEL    is the selector to the private buffer
                 SHORT  is the offset to the private buffer
                 SHORT  is the size of the buffer
                        (maximum value = 64KB)
                          records

         Returns:  0 - indicates correct operation, buffer is now filled
                       with copy of the system trace buffer
                   ERROR_SYSTEM_TRACE - System trace is not enabled

In order to successfully resolve<B> DosGetSTDA</B> function calls in your
program, the following lines must be added to the Linker Definition (DEF)

<P>
<U><I>Remarks</I></U>
<P>
<B>DosGetSTDA</B> returns a buffer that contains a copy of the system trace
buffer. The buffer is circular with a header record that contains pointers
to the first and last data bytes and a pointer to the next byte that was
available for writing (the buffer is a snapshot of the system trace buffer
at the time that the API was called). A set of trace records follows the
header. Each trace record contains a trace event trailer and optionally
a timestamp and/or a data field. A Timestamp record is optional and will
only exist if bit 2 of the flag field in the Trace Event Trailer is set
to OFF. 
<P>
The trace event data contains the information describing each individual
trace event. The events traced may be from OS/2 system supplied or other
user supplied tracepoints. In either case the data is dependent on each
individual tracepoint. Descriptions of the data and formatting instructions
for the OS/2 system supplied tracepoints can be found in the <A HREF="445_L1_SystemTracepointsRef.html">System
Tracepoints Reference</A>  chapter.
