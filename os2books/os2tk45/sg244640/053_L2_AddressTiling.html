<P>
Address tiling refers to the practice of creating a mathematical or algorithmic
relationship between an LDT selector and the base, or virtual address in
the descriptor.
<P>
By using address tiling, OS2 avoids the need to move memory blocks because
of reallocation, and also makes it very fast to convert an LDT Selector:Offset
to a flat, or Linear Address.  The implementation is simply to allocate
64K of virtual address space to each selector, starting with selector '000F',
at virtual address 64K, or '%10000'.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Selector '0007' is used to map the LDT as read-only data.
