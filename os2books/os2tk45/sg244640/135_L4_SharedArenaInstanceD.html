<P>
A DLL Instance data allocation shares only its address range among its accessors.
The data is mapped to a different set of physical pages for each process.

<P>
This type of allocation is represented by a single VMAR with a chained list
of VMOBs, one for each accessor. This is the only case where VMOBs are linked
by the<B> hobnxt</B> field.
<P>
The following diagram depicts this situation.
<P>
Control blocks and data that directly represent the allocation are shown
shaded. <!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="135_L4_SharedArenaInstanceD_6.gif" WIDTH=762 HEIGHT=1016>
