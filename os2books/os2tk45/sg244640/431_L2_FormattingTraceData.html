<H1>Formatting Trace Data</H1><!-- entering slot 612 -->This section gives a brief description of the
formatting process as an aid to generating correct formatting strings.
<P>
Each trace record stored in the RAS buffer consists of a header followed
by a number of variable length trace data records. The header identifies
the major and minor code, time stamp, process ID, etc., and the total length
of the trace data for that trace record.
<P>
Each<B> MEM32</B>,<B> MEM</B>,<B> ASCIIZ32</B>, or<B> ASCIIZ</B> data statement,
coded in the trace source file for a tracepoint, produces an associated
data record to be stored in the trace buffer. The data records consist of
a 3-byte prefix followed by the trace data. This prefix consists of a status
byte followed by the length of the data for that statement. The status byte
indicates whether valid data has been traced.
<P>
Dynamic trace can only trace data that is resident in memory at the time
that the tracepoint is executed. Data may not be able to be traced for two
reasons:  it resides in a page that is currently paged out or the address
specified is invalid. This latter case usually occurs due to tracing indirectly
via invalid pointer variables. In either of these two cases dynamic trace
sets the status byte accordingly and stores the pointer in the place of
the wanted data. No more data is attempted to be traced for this invocation
of the tracepoint, but tracing will resume the next time this tracepoint
is encountered.
<P>
Since the position of these prefix bytes, within a trace record, is dependent
on the data being traced and the number of<B> MEM32</B>,<B> MEM</B>,<B> ASCIIZ32</B>,
or<B> ASCIIZ</B> statements, the Trace Formatter must be told when to expect
the prefix in the trace record. This is the purpose of the<B> %P</B> and
<B>%R</B> formatting controls. One of these must be coded in the formatting
string at every place a data record is expected, (noting the restrictions
on the use of<B> %R</B> specified in the description of the <A HREF="419_L4_FMTKeyword.html"><B>FMT=
</B>keyword.</A>
<P>
The following values are used in the status byte of the prefix:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Valid data to log<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->ASCIIZ string to log<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Invalid Selector<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Selector not Present<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Page not Present<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>

<P>
If the prefix indicates an error TRACEFMT will interpret the error and format
the failing address.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> With ASCIIZ and ASCIIZ32 commands, the prefix is used by the
TRACEFMT utility to obtain the length of the string since the string is
not null terminated.
