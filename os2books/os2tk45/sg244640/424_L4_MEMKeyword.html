<P>
This is used to log memory in a function compiled using 16-bit segment:offset
addressing and is coded as:
<PRE>

        MEM=(address_spec,flag,{length|LEN}),

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a segmented memory address specification as described in <A HREF="427_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address
Specification.</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> flag<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a mandatory parameter that identifies the level of indirection to be
used on the address. It is one of:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
D[IRECT]<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
IF<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> DIRECT implies that the address specifies a memory
location to be saved in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address contains a segmented address and is dereferenced
to obtain the memory location. The optional asterisks denote the level of
indirection, one for each level.  The indirect offsets<B> iiiiiiii</B> are
added to or subtracted from the value found at the given level of indirection.

<P>
IF (Indirect Flat) means that the address contains a flat address that is
dereferenced to obtain the memory location.
<P>
Only far pointers may be dereferenced when using segmented addressing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> length
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the number of bytes at the memory location to be saved in the trace buffer.
If<I> length</I> is too big, a warning message will be given, and<I> length
</I>will be set to MAXDATALENGTH. If<I> length</I> is<B> 0</B> an error
message will be given, and this tracepoint will be ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LEN
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
specifies that this is a variable length record to log and the length was
specified by the preceding<B> LEN</B> statement.  If there was no preceding
<B>LEN</B> statement, this tracepoint is rejected. Either length or LEN
must be specified, but not both.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
