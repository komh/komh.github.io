<P>
This is used to log a string in a function compiled using 16-bit segment:offset
addressing and is coded as:
<PRE>
        ASCIIZ=(address_spec,flag,maxlength),

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a segmented memory address specification as described in <A HREF="427_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address
Specification.</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> flag<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a mandatory parameter that identifies the level of indirection to be
used on the address. It is one of:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
D[IRECT]<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
IF<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> DIRECT implies that the address points to a memory
location, the contents of which are to be saved in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address points to a far pointer which is a segmented
address that is dereferenced to obtain the target location to save in the
trace buffer. The optional asterisks denote the level of indirection, one
for each level.  The indirect offsets<B> iiiiiiii</B> are added to or subtracted
from the value found at the given level of indirection.
<P>
IF (Indirect Flat) means that the address points to a far pointer which
is is a flat address that is dereferenced to obtain the target location
to save in the trace buffer. Only far pointers may be dereferenced using
segmented addresses.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> maxlength<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the maximum length of the string that will be saved in the trace buffer.
It should be no greater than MAXDATALENGTH. The actual length to be traced
will depend on where the zero terminating byte is found.
<P>
If<I> maxlength</I> is<B> 0</B> an error message will be given, and this
tracepoint will be ignored.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When using dynamic tracing, the OS/2 kernel<I> does not</I> place
the terminating null byte into the trace buffer; therefore the prefix byte
must be used by the Trace Formatter to obtain the length of the string.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
