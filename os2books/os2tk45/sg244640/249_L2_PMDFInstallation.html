<H1>PMDF Installation</H1><!-- entering slot 374 -->
<P>
PMDF provides a convenient front-end to the Dump Formatter. By installing
<B>PMDF</B> in an appropriate directory structure it is able to select automatically
the correct version of Dump Formatter for the dump to be analysed.
<P>
PMDF is installed by using the installation of the<B> OS2PDP</B> package.
The resulting directory structure is as follows: 
<PRE>

 \PMDF\ ─────────── PMDF.EXE ─ PMDF.INF ─ PMDF.HLP ─ PMDFMSG.DLL ─ PMDFVERS.LST ─ *.CMD
  │
  ├──── \GA21\ ──── DF_RET.EXE ── DF_DEB.EXE ── *.SYM ─ *.SDF
  │
  ├──── \GA21MR1\ ─ DF_RET.EXE ── DF_DEB.EXE ── *.SYM ─ *.SDF
  │
  ├──── \Warp\ ──── DF_RET.EXE ── DF_DEB.EXE ── *.SYM ─ *.SDF
  │
  ├──── \Warp_fp\ ─ DF_RET.EXE ── DF_DEB.EXE ── *.SYM ─ *.SDF
  │
  │       .
  │       .
          .
  .       .
  .       .


</PRE>
 
<P>
Each version of OS/2 is represented by a subdirectory containing the Dump
Formatters and symbol files and structure definition files for that version.

<P>
The home directory contains the PMDF executables and help files, the version
control file - PMDFVERS.LST, and any REXX EXECs to be installed in their
default directory. 
<P>
<U><I>PMDFVERS.LST</I></U>
<P>
More versions of the Dump Formatter may be installed by creating a new subdirectory
for the new Dump Formatter and adding an entry to the PMDFVERS.LST file.
Each entry of this file corresponds to an OS/2 build level or version. The
format of an entry is as follows:
<PRE>
    relative path:build level:descriptive text

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
The path is relative to the home directory.
<P>
The build level is the internal system build level and may be determined
either by browsing the OS2KRNL load module and searching for the text<B> @#IBM:n.nnn#@
</B>near the end of the module, or by using the BLDLEVEL utility in the
OS2 directory. The<B> VER /R</B> command is not reliable since it only reports
the base version level, not the fix-pack version level, in some releases.

<P>
The directory structure in the example above would be represented by the
following entries:
<PRE>ga21:6.514;OS/2 2.1 General Availability
ga21mr1:6.617:OS/2 2.11 MR1
warp:8.162:Warp
warp_fp:8.200:Warp Full Pack
