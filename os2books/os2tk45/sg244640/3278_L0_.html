<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3593 --> The Interrupt descriptor table (IDT) is a hardware
architected structure that comprises a table of <A HREF="3271_L0_.html">gate
descriptors,</A> one for each <A HREF="3279_L0_.html">interrupt vector.
</A>The low numbered entries are defined by the hardware architecture and
dedicated to exception management.
<P>
Under OS/2 one IDT is allocated for the entire system except for VDMs in
which multiple IDTs per VDM are possible. A VDM will allocate one IDT per
DPMI client, but if it does not use DPMI then the common system IDT is used.
When multiple IDTs are used in a VDM then only the entries not reserved
for H/W exceptions and interrupts are allowed to differ.
<P>
The Kernel Debugger's <A HREF="313_L3_VExceptionTrapFaultV.html">V command
</A>may be used to intercept system exception handlers.
