<H1>TP Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 593 -->
<P>
The TP parameter is a required keyword parameter. If TP is specified more
than once for a single tracepoint definition, the tracepoint is discarded.
TP has three mutually exclusive definitions which can be coded as:
<PRE>
        TP=@STATIC,

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
STATIC<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
defines this tracepoint entry to be used only for creating a trace format
statement for the TFF file.  No tracepoint definition is created for the
TDF, and the only other TRACE parameters that will be used are<B> DESC</B>,
<B>MINOR</B> and<B> FMT</B>. This is used to create trace formatting information
for static tracepoints (or dynamic tracepoints generated directly by the
<A><!-- external link: 1D FE FF 48 -->DTRACE command</A>). If the TSF contains
only @STATIC directives, no TDF files are created and MODNAME is then not
required.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<PRE>        TP=@filename,linenum,

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
filename<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is an ASCII string specifying the name (including extension) of a source
filename used in creating the module. The source filename is stored in the
debug information contained in the executable module, so debug information
must exist to use this parameter. The filename is not case sensitive.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
path information may be specfied with<B> filename</B> when also specified
at compilation time.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> linenum<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a decimal number specifying the line number in the given source file
name to place the tracepoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Debug information must exist to use this option. The statement
at the given source linenum may have been rearranged during compiler optimization,
so the developer must use this with caution.  If the linenum is not found
in the debug information, the tracepoint is applied at the next linenum
defined in the debug information and a warning message is issued to the
user.
<P>
An example to apply a tracepoint to line 35 of file stubfile.c is:
<PRE>    TRACE   MINOR=0x700A,              /* puts tracepoint on code at line */            TP=@stubfile.c,35,.....    /*  35 of source file stubfile.c   */
</PRE>

<P>
Use of line number refernece affords great flexibility is tracepoint location,
however the user will need to modify the TSF file every time referenced
source files are updated. To facilitate this the <A HREF="441_L2_UsingtheMAKETSFUtili.html">MAKETSF
</A>utility may be used to generate line number references automaticaly
from TSF statements embeeded as comments in C or Assembler source.
<PRE>
        TP=.name[{+|-}offs][,RETEP[=retopt[+retopt...]]],

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
name<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a public label or an entry point name of a procedure to be traced. The
"." preceding<B> name</B> is required.<B> Name</B> must be found in the
debug information in the module or<B> name</B> must be a public symbol as
found in the MAP file. If debug information is used, the address of this
tracepoint will be immediately following the prologue of the procedure.
If MAP information is used, this address points to the opcode at the given
label unless the<B> /PREINV</B> command line switch is specified. In this
case TRCUST attempts to locate the instruction following the
<PRE>      MOV EBP,ESP

or

      MOV BP,SP
</PRE>
instructions as with done when debug information is used. Use of<B> /PREINV
</B>allows parameter and local variable references to be made relative to
<B>EBP</B> in non-optimised code.
<P>
See <A HREF="402_L4_SourceLevelSymbolicS.html">Source Level Symbolic Support
</A>and <A HREF="403_L4_MAPFileSupport.html">MAP File Support</A> for information
on using symbolic references.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> offs<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
is a decimal (specified as nnnnnnnn)  or hex (specified as 0xnnnnnnnn) offset
from the entry point address.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> RETEP<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> (optional)

<P>
specifies that the tracepoint will be<!-- entering slot 594 --> inserted
at the<B> return</B> address corresponding to this entry point.
<P>
Default criteria for specifying the return point are specified by the<B> /RM
</B>RETEP mode command line option. TRCUST will search back from the end
of the routine for the instruction sequence matching the RETEP mode. The
length of the search is governed by the<B> /RS</B> command line option.
The default RETEP mode may be overridden per tracepoint by coding one or
more optional<B> retopt</B> keywords, separated by a<B> +</B> sign with
RETEP. The following keywords are allowed:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
CV<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> use CodeView information.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> LRET
<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>search for a LEAVE+RET or POP EBP + RET instruction
sequences near the end of the routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> RET<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> search
for RET instruction sequences near the end of the routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> JMP
<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>search for JMP instruction sequences near the end
of the routine.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> to reduce the hazard of generting a tracepoint on a non-instruction
boundary, JMP instructions with 0xFF opcodes are not selected.<!-- lm: 0x2 20 --><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> LEAVE
<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL>search for a LEAVE instruction near the end of the
routine.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --> 
</UL><B> Note: </B>
<P>
If more than one option is specified the RETEP uses the following order
of precidence: CV, LRET, RET, LEAVE, JMP.
<P>
When the RETEP is used, the<B> name</B> must be a valid entry point to a
procedure.
<P>
The RETEP option depends upon the manner in which a C compiler generates
its code. Therefore this option may not work will some of the newer compilers
or with code optimisation.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
<B>Warning:</B>
<P>
Use of RETEP can run the risk of having a tracepoint not generated on an
insruction boundary. The result of which would be unpredictable and probably
cause the traced program to trap. This risk is grealty reduced by allowing
the RETEP mode to default to<B> /RM2</B>. If the user chooses to widen the
RETEP criteria then appropriate validation of the resulting tracepoints
must be made.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For ASM functions to accomplish tracing, a label must be made
public to have a tracepoint applied.  Therefore, to accomplish "POST" tracing,
a label must be made public at the return statement.
<P>
Partial examples of Pre/Post tracing of DosOpen follows:
<PRE>      TRACE   MINOR=0x0001,              TP=.DosOpen,.....            /* Pre-invocation tracing */

      TRACE   MINOR=0x8001,
              TP=.DosOpen,RETEP,.....      /* Post-invocation tracing */
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is not possible to set dynamic tracepoints on the following
machine instructions:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
0x9C<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> PUSHF<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xCC<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

</UL>0x62<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> BOUND<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0x69<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->

</UL>0xF7<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> DIV, IDIV, MUL, IMUL<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
TRCUST gives an error for these opcodes and the tracepoint is rejected.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> No more than one tracepoint may be applied to a given address.
