<P>
Each of the three types of arena discussed in the previous section is managed
by: <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
An Arena Header Record (<B>VMAH</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
A Sentinel Arena Record (<B>VMAR</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
The<B> VMAHs</B> are maintained in a double-linked list. They contain information
about the extent to which an arena has been used. Of particular interest
are the following fields:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>0x0<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Pointer to the next VMAH<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> +0x4
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Pointer to the previous VMAH<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> +0x8
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Pointer to the Sentinel Arena Record for this arena
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>+0xc<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Pointer to the VMAR
adjacent to the 1st free area.
<P>
In the case of expand down arenas (the shared arena), this is the VMAR for
the region of memory allocated above the first free area below the Minimum
Read/Write Basing region.
<P>
In the case of expand-up arenas (system and private) this is the VMAR for
the region of memory allocated just below the lowest free area.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> +0x20
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Current minimum linear address allocated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> +0x24
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>Current Maximum linear address allocated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>VMAHs</B> are located:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
at _ahvmSys for the Shared Arena<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
at _ahvmhShr for the High Memory System Arena<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
at _ahvmShr for the System Arena<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
imbedded at +0x40 in each PTDA for Private Arenas<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Arena Records (<B>VMARs</B>) are used to describe virtual storage reservations.
These are described in more detail in <A HREF="129_L4_VirtualMemoryArenaRe.html">Virtual
Memory Arena Records</A>, below.
<P>
A special form of the<B> VMAR</B> is the Sentinel Arena Record. This serves
two purposes:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
To track the theoretical size limits of an Arena<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
To act as the head to a double-linked list of Regular<B> VMARs</B>, each
of which describes a specific allocation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The sentinel<B> VMAR</B> for the Shared Arena is called the Boundary Sentinel,
since it determines where the (dynamic) boundary between shared an private
arenas lies. The boundary is adjusted to reflect the current highest private
arena address.
<P>
The manner in which<B> VMARs</B> and<B> VMAHs</B> are organised to manage
the three types of arena is shown in the following diagram: <!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="128_L4_VirtualAddressSpaceM_2.gif" WIDTH=762 HEIGHT=1016>
