<H1>MEM32 Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 604 -->
<P>
This is used to log memory in a function compiled using 32-bit flat addressing
and is coded as:
<PRE>
        MEM32=(address_spec,flag,{length|LEN}),

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a flat memory address specification as described in <A HREF="427_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address
Specification.</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> flag<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is a mandatory parameter that identifies the level of indirection to be
used on the address. It is one of:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
D[IRECT]<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<BR>
IS<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> DIRECT implies that the address specifies a memory
location to be saved in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address contains a flat address and is dereferenced
to obtain the memory location. The optional asterisks denote the level of
indirection, one for each level.  The indirect offsets<B> iiiiiiii</B> are
added to or subtracted from the value found at the given level of indirection.

<P>
IS (Indirect Segmented) means that the address contains a segmented address
that is dereferenced to obtain the memory location.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> length
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
is the number of bytes at the memory location to be saved in the trace buffer.
If<I> length</I> is too big, a warning message will be given, and<I> length
</I>will be set to MAXDATALENGTH. If<I> length</I> is<B> 0</B> an error
message will be given, and this tracepoint will be ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LEN
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
specifies that this is a variable length record to log and the length was
specified by the preceding<B> LEN</B> statement.  If there was no preceding
<B>LEN</B> statement, this tracepoint is rejected. Either length or LEN
must be specified, but not both.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Example of the MEM32 statement follows:
<PRE>     TRACE MINOR=.....           /* To log retcode enter the following: */
           MEM32=(.retcode,DIRECT,2),

           /* s_ptr is a pointer to a structure, log it for 4 bytes. */
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,4),

           /* Field 6 bytes into structure pointed at by s_ptr is a     */
           /*  pointer to a structure, log 8 bytes past begin of struct.*/
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT*+6*+8,10),  /* logs ten bytes */

           /* s_ptr points to a variable length record, second field */
           /*  is the record length (offset 4 from record beginning).*/
           LEN=(s_ptr,INDIRECT*+4),
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,LEN)

           /* s_end points to the end of same variable length record,*/
           /*  second field is the record length (offset -6 from     */
           /*  record beginning).                                    */
           LEN=(s_end,INDIRECT*-6),
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,LEN)
</PRE>
