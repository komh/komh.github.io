<H1>PMDF REXX interface</H1><!-- entering slot 382 -->
<P>
PMDF provides a REXX interface that allows REXX EXECs to issue Dump Formatter
commands and capture their output in REXX variables. EXECs are able to display
output on PMDF's scrollable output window. command line and enter 
<P>
EXECs are invoked by entering the REXX EXEC name, with optional directory
information, prefixed with a '%' character from the PMDF command window.
 If the exec is not installed in a directory in the PATH or in the same
directory as PMDF then it must be prefixed with the fully qualified path
name.  For example:
<PRE>
        %SEGTAB 123

        %C:\MYEXECS\TEST1 parm1 parm2

</PRE>
It is also possible to use relative path expressions thus:
<PRE>
        %..\SEGATB 123

</PRE>

<P>
If a path has to be specified when passing an exec name as a parameter to
another exec then quotation marks around the path and file name will be
required. 
<P>
PMDF implements its interface to the Dump Formatter by creating a REXX subcommand
environment. The REXX<B> address</B> instruction allows an EXEC to execute
and capture the output from a Dump Formatter command by addressing this
subcommand environment.
<P>
The syntax and parameters for this implementation of the<B> address</B> instruction
are:
<PRE>
        address df 'CMD' &lt;output&gt; &lt;df_cmd&gt;

</PRE>

<P>
Where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
&lt;output&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> is the name of a stem to a REXX
compound variable that will be assigned to capture output from the Dump
Formatter command.
<P>
 "output.0" will be set to the number of lines. "output.n" will contain
the nth line of output.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;df_cmd&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> is
the dump formatter command and parameters.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Parameters following the EXEC name will be passed to the EXEC as a one parameter
string.
<P>
A number of general purpose EXECs are provided in the OS2PDP package on
the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

commands per thread slot.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>A Template EXEC containing a collection of subroutines
useful for writing other EXECs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are also a number of example EXECs that format control blocks and
illustrate how to use the REXX interface and the subroutines contained in
TEMPLATE.
