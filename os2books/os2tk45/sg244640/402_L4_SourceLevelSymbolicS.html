<H1>Source Level Symbolic Support</H1><!-- entering slot 581 -->
<P>
If the module has been compiled and linked with the debug options:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><LI>Ti</B> on the C/Set2 or ViualAge language
compiler for C source files<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><LI>CO</B> or<B> DE</B> on the link command
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>then the Trace Customizer can look into the module to extract symbolic
or debugging information. In this case addresses may be specified symbolically.
Having generated trace definitions there is no further use for symbolic
information. Thus debugging information may be safely removed by using the
<A HREF="443_L2_UsingtheDEBDELUtilit.html">DEBDEL</A> utility.
<P>
<B>Notes: </B>
<P>
Not all source files must be C language when using symbolic support.  Assembler
and other languages may be used as long as they generate Micorsoft 16-bit
CodeView or IBM HLL version 3 and 4 symbolic debugging information.
<P>
Tracepoints may be defined by filename and line number references or by
symbolic names.
<P>
Tracepoints may reference local or global variables.
<P>
If symbolic names are referenced then the following points should be observed:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Some compilers will modify external or public symbolic names used in the
program. If this is done then the modified form must be used when referenced
in the TSF. The modification rules are compiler dependent however three
common cases are cited below.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Names must be used case sensitively.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
With IBM C/2 and Microsoft C 6.0, external routine names have an underscore
prefix to their names when declared using the<B> cdecl</B>  convention and
are capitalised when declared using the<B> Pascal</B>  convention.  Symbols
for routine names treated this way refer to the first instruction of the
routine.  When debugging information is present, the unaltered name is also
usable and refers to the first instruction following the prologue code,
that is creation of the entry stack frame.  For example both<B> _main</B>
and<B> main</B>  may be used.  The former refers to the true entry point
and the latter after the prologue code. The advantage of using the latter
form (<B>main</B>)  is that symbolic references may be made to the parameters
passed; in this example<B> argc</B><B> argv</B>  and<B> envp</B>.
<P>
C runtime library routine names are usually prefixed with an underscore.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
With IBM CSET/2 and IBM VisualAge C symbolic names defined by the user are
<I>not</I> prefixed with an underscore. However C runtime library routine
names<I> are</I> usually prefixed with an underscore. Symbols for routine
names defined by the user refer to the initial instruction of the routine
when compiled without symbolic debugging information and to the first instruction
following the prologue code when debugging information is present.  In the
latter case, symbolic references may be made to parameters passed to the
routine.  In the former case this is not possible except by making<B> EBP
</B> relative references and using the<B> /PREINV</B> command line switch
- see <A HREF="403_L4_MAPFileSupport.html">MAP File Support</A> for more
information in using symbolic references without the presence of symbolic
debugging information.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
With IBM VisualAge C++ routine names are subject to name<I> mangling</I> where
class-hierarchical information is encoded into the externalised name. The
mangled form of the name must be used in TSF references.
<P>
In all cases symbolic name lengths are restricted to a maximum length of
255 characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
