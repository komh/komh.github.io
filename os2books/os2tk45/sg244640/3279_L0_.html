<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3594 -->An<B> interrupt vector</B> is presented to the
processor when an interrupt is generated either externally by the Programmed
Interrupt Controller or internally within the processor chip itself. It
is used by the processor as an index into the <A HREF="3278_L0_.html">IDT
</A>to determine which interrupt routine should be dispatched.
<P>
The processor reserves<B> vectors</B> 0 - 31 to correspond to hardware architected
exceptions 0 through 31.<B> Vectors</B> 32 - 255 are reserved for I/O interrupts,
which are presented to the processor by the Programmed Interrupt Controller
when the one of its<B> IRQ</B> lines is triggered. The correspondence between
<B>vectors</B> and<B> IRQs</B> is defined during system initialisation as
follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
IRQs 0 - 7<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> vectors 0x50 - 0x57<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> IRQs
8 - 15<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> vectors 0x70 - 0x77<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Thus a keyboard interrupt, which is assigned to IRQ 1 under the IBM PC architecture
will be handled by the interrupted handler whose <A HREF="3271_L0_.html">interrupt
gate</A> is assigned to<B> IDT</B> descriptor<B> 0x51</B>.
<P>
See the Dump Formatter and Kernel Debugger <A HREF="292_L3_DIDisplayInterruptDe.html">DI
command</A> for information on displaying<B> IDT</B> entries.
