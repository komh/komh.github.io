<H1>NEAR & FAR Addresses</H1><!-- entering slot 24 -->
<P>
Because there are two parts of an address and an item may or may not be
in a current segment, there are two ways to specify the address of a data
item.
<P>
A NEAR ADDRESS is an offset without specifying a selector. This is a very
efficient way to address data because the overhead of loading a selector
register and fetching the descriptor is avoided. The selector to use is
implied, and is normally already loaded.
<P>
A FAR ADDRESS contains both a selector and an offset in protect mode. This
is slower and more cumbersome because both address components must be specified
as well as causing the overhead of altering a selector register. When a
far address is displayed from storage (as two words), the offset will be
seen in the left word, and the segment or selector in the right word.
<P>
A FAR ADDRESS contains a segment and an offset in real or V86 mode. The
overhead is not so bad as in protect mode, because there are no descriptors
to fetch when a segment register is loaded.
