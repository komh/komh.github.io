;  Trace source file for the MIXED dynalink.
;    Parts were compiled with 16-bit compiler, some with 32-bit compiler.
;    The developer must know how the parameters being sent in are
;    to be addressed, whether they are segmented or flat addresses.

                 compiled with the flat addressing specification.
