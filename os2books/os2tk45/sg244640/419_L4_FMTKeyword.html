<H1>FMT Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 599 -->The optional FMT parameter is used to produce
the formatting string for the trace data. The developer should use these
to control formatting the output produced by the Trace Formatter.  Each
<B>FMT</B> keyword causes CR/LF to be appended to the format string. The
formatting string is similar to a C library printf string specification.
It consists of ASCII characters and formatting controls enclosed in double
quotes as for a C language string. Each formatting primitive describes the
format of the data in the trace buffer at the formatting position and must
match the data stored in the trace buffer by the data statements described
later. See <A HREF="431_L2_FormattingTraceData.html">Formatting Trace Data
</A>for a description of how the data is stored in the trace buffer and
subsequently formatted.
<P>
The formatting controls are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Innn<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Ignore nnn number of bytes in the trace
buffer.
<P>
This tells the Trace Formatter to skip over the next nnn bytes in the current
trace record. This could be used, for example, to skip over unimportant
data, traced as a block, and only output the data of interest.
<P>
When using this control, nnn represents an ASCII decimal number and must
be followed by a space.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "ignore ten bytes %I10 here",
                   FMT = "       and two more %I2 here",

        generates: ignore ten bytes here
                          and two more here

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%P<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Process the data prefix
bytes associated with the trace data.
<P>
This tells the Trace Formatter that the next bytes in the trace record are
the prefix or header bytes for data logged by the dynamic tracing mechanism.
This is required to precede any format control describing data logged from
memory.  Do not use this before data that was logged from a register and
never use with static tracepoints.
<P>
%P may be used in combination with any of the following formatting controls:
%A, %B, %C, %D, %F, %Q, %S, %U, %W.
<P>
%P%x may be specified as %Px.
<P>
See <A HREF="431_L2_FormattingTraceData.html"> Formatting Trace Data</A> for
a description of how the data is stored in the trace buffer and the use
of this control.
<PRE>
        statements: FMT="memory byte = %P%B",

        generates:  memory byte = C2

in hexadecimal.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "memory byte = %P%B"

        generates: memory byte = 01

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Output an ASCII character

<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "memory bytes = %C%C%C"

        generates: memory byte = ABC

</PRE>

<P>
<B>%C</B> formats a byte of data as a single ASCII character, with no separating
spaces. Bytes outside the range 0x20 - 0x7f are formatted as periods.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The<B> %C</B> formatting control is only available with TRCUST 2.26 or later
and  TRACEFMT version 2.2 or later.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> %W
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Output a word of data.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "register word = %W"

        generates: register word = 0001


        statement: FMT = "memory word = %P%W"

        generates: memory word = 0001

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Output a double word of

        generates: flat address EAX = 00004B2C

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%Q<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Output a quad word of
data.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "quad word from regs EAX and EBX = %Q"

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%R<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Repeat the following format
control for the rest of the memory that was logged.
<P>
The action of %R differs between dynamic and static trace:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
For dynamic trace records, %R will process the 3-byte memory prefix to determine
the length of data to which repeat formatting applies.  %R is used in place
of the %P control.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
For static trace records, %R applies itself to all the remaining data in
the trace buffer. No 3-byte memory prefix is examined or processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> %R
may be used only with the following formatting controls: %A, %B, %C, %D,
%F, %Q, %W, in particular it has no meaning with %S and %U.
<PRE>
   statement: FMT = "log a variable number of words from memory = %R%W"

   generates: log a variable number of words from memory = 0001 0004

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%S<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Output an ASCIIZ string.

<P>
The prefix formatting control should always precede this for dynamic tracepoints
because the data was logged from memory.
<P>
<B>Note: </B><!-- entering slot 600 --> If the tracepoint is static, then
<B>%P</B> should not be used because the string is terminated with a null
byte.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "string = %P%S"

        generates: string = c:\os2\os2.ini

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%U<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Format the remainder of
the trace record as a sequence of bytes in hexadecimal or dump format depending
upon the View pull-down selection from TRACEFMT.
<P>
This will output the remaining of the traced data, including any prefix
bytes.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "garbage = %U"

        generates: garbage = [00 00 00 03 c2 c1 c4 ff 04 00 09 c0 18]

</PRE>

<P>
With fix pack 35 for OS/2 Warp V3.0, fix pack 10 of OS/2 Warp V4.0 and OS/2
Warp E-Server the TRACEFMT utility permits unformatted data to be displayed
in dump format, where both the hexadecimal and ASCII representations of
the data are displayed together with offsets. ASCII characters outside the
range 0x20-0x7f are displayed as '.' for example:
<PRE>
       Data [+0000  04 00 5A 00 00 0C 00 2B-DF F6 FF FF FF 00 00 01  ..Z....+........ ]
       Data [+0010  00 01 C0                                         ... ]

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%X<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Output the major event
code.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "major code = %X"

        generates: major code = 00C2

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%Y<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL> Output the minor event
code.
<PRE>
        statement: FMT = "minor code = %Y"

        generates: minor code = 0081

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note to CMVC Users: </B> To avoid conflicts with source file control
information, all formatting specifications can be in upper or lower case.
Also, prefix format specifications may be combined with data format specifications.
For example, the following create the same format controls in the TFF:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<PRE>        FMT = "%P%W here"
        FMT = "%p%w here"
        FMT = " %P %W here"
