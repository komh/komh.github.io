<H1>Approach to Problem Solving</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->
<P>
In order to succeed at low-level program problem diagnosis, one must have
several skills. None of these is particularly difficult, but many are foreign
to today's programmers.
<P>
At first, it will appear that each problem is solved with a different technique.
Study of the methods used to solve problems yields the fact that the several
skills are used as appropriate, virtually as subroutines, and without thought,
by experienced analysts.
<P>
The intent of this material is to provide the basic knowlege and to illustrate
each of the skills separately, to aid understanding. Trying to solve problems
without the basic skills can be extremely frustrating, at best.
<P>
The fundamentals include knowlege of hardware operation, software conventions,
and basic use of tools to display the data sought. Once the fundamentals
are understood, it is time to begin using them to solve problems, because
one can then concentrate on building the problem solving skill.
<P>
Application traps are perhaps the easiest problems to approach, so they
are explained after the basic skills.  Similarly, traps in privileged code
are only incrementally more difficult.
<P>
Once some experience in solving traps has been gained, it is reasonable
to extend one's skills by exploring reasons for waits and loops, collectively
known as hangs, or to learn the additional functions provided by Symmetric
Multi-Processor (SMP) systems, as well as the challenges in properly serializing
them when needed.
