<H1></H1><!-- entering slot 3644 -->The<B> User Virtual (UVIRT)</B> attribute signifies
a virtual storage mapping to physical storage made without the full set
memory management structures.
<P>
The UVIRT attribute may be associated with a number of structures, for example:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A HREF="3327_L0_.html">PTE</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="3332_L0_.html">LDT</A> and <A HREF="3331_L0_.html">GDT</A> descriptors.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<A HREF="3337_L0_.html">VMAL</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In general UVIRT allocations are 'convenience' mappings, which map memory
to selector allocation. The attribute is used by Memory Management to signal
minimal processsing requirements.  Typically they are created by device
drivers using the DevHlp_PhysToUvirt facility.  They are also created by
the system where a 'quick' form of aliasing is required without the alias
being associated with any memory object.  Examples of this are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
VDM private arena memory<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Selectors 5b and 53, 32-bit Code and Data selectors which are used by most
32-bit application programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Selector 30, the TASKAREA selector, which aliases the current process' <A HREF="3346_L0_.html">TSD</A>,
<A HREF="3345_L0_.html">TCB</A> and <A HREF="3335_L0_.html">PTDA</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
