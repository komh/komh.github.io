<H1>The Configuration Process</H1><!-- entering slot 333 -->
<P>
After you have assembled the required items, follow these steps to prepare
the MUT for remote debugging:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Connect the Modem to the MUT.
<P>
Connect one end of the data cable to the modem, and the other end to the
serial port on the MUT.  If the MUT has more than one serial port, connect
the cable to the port configured as COM2 (the debug kernel uses COM2 by
default).  On PS/2 systems, the reference diskette can tell you which port
is configured as COM2.  Connect the telephone line to the modem, and power
the modem on.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Program the modem for DEBUG operation:
<P>
Programming the modem may be a complex process, depending on the type of
modem and the intended use.  There are two ways to program the modem:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Quick programming for single debug use<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Full programming for "permanent" debug use.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> The
"quick" method is simple, but the modem will not be programmed to recover
from loss of power or repeated calls.  The "full" method allows the modem
to be programmed once, and then used whenever debugging is needed.
<P>
The "quick" programming is performed by the debug kernel itself through
use of the <A HREF="218_L3_TheKDBINIInitialisat.html">KDB.INI</A> file.
In addition to containing start up commands for the debugger<B> KDB.INI
</B>can also contain modem initialisation strings coded as operands to the
Kernel Debugger <A HREF="274_L3_ShowInternalCommandH.html">? command</A>.
For this reason, the modem must be connected and powered on when the MUT
is booted, and cannot be powered off until debugging is complete.
<P>
The first lines of the<B> KDB.INI</B> may will be COM port selection and
parameters if defaults are not suitable, for example:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B><LI>B 1200t 1</B><!-- lm: 0x11 21 -->
<UL> (Set debugger for 1200 bps,
comm port 1)<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Following this are the modem initialisation
strings, which are unique to each type of modem.  The commands in the initialisation
string must:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Activate "auto-answer"<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Lock the DTE at 9600 bps<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Activate XON/XOFF flow control<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Ignore the DTR signal (not supplied by the debug
kernel)<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Suppress result codes.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> The
remaining lines of the KDB.INI file may contain other debugging commands.
The last of these is normally<B> G</B>.
<P>
The "quick" programming strings for several popular modems are as follows.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B><LI><LI>AT&amp;F E0 Q1 &amp;B1 &amp;H2 &amp;I2 &amp;D0 S0=1"</B><!-- lm: 0x11 21 -->
<UL> US
Robotics HST and Dual Standard<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL><B> ? "AT&amp;F2 E0
Q2 &amp;D0 &amp;K4 S0=1"</B><!-- lm: 0x11 21 -->
<UL> Supra FAX/Modem V.32bis
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL><B>? "AT&amp;F E0 Q1 &amp;D0 \Q1 S0=1"</B><!-- lm: 0x11 21 -->
<UL> Intel
14.4EX<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> An alternative "quick" technique for entering
the Hayes modem initialisation commands, which avoids the use of<B> KDB.INI
</B>is illustrated by the following example. This example assumes that the
default COM2 port is to be used:
<PRE>1. In CONFIG.SYS add the following line

       RUN=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE /K C:\MODEM.CMD

2. Edit a file called MODEM.CMD and enter the following two lines

       MODE COM2:9600,N,<!-- entering slot 334 -->8,1
       COPY MODEM COM2

3. Edit a file called MODEM and enter the following line

       AT&amp;K4&amp;D0S0=1&amp;W
</PRE>

<P>
To use "Full" programming, you will configure the modem with the same features
as in "quick" programming, but the settings will be stored in the modem's
firmware (or set in modem switches). Determining how to store these settings
can be difficult.  A thorough study of the modem manual may be required.
 To program the modem, use a terminal emulation program (for example, the
SOFTERM program that is supplied with OS/2).  When programming the modem,
Set the terminal program for 9600 BPS operation, and type the appropriate
modem string. Since the initialisation string instructs the modem to suppress
result codes, the modem will not return a response.  The "FULL" programming
strings for several modems are: <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<P>
Once the modem is connected, and programmed, the system should be ready
for remote debugging.  Re-boot the system with the debug kernel installed.
When the telephone rings, the debug modem should answer the phone, and establish
connection with the caller.  The modem-to-kernel speed should remain at
9600 bps (the default speed used by the debug kernel), but the modem-to-modem
speed can be whatever is used by the remote modem. If both modems support
error correction, correction will be used.
