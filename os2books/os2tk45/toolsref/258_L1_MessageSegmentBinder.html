<H1>Message Segment Binder (MSGBIND)</H1><!-- entering slot 265 -->
<P>
The MSGBIND program binds a message segment to an executable program. It
does this by reading an input file that specifies the executable files to
modify.  For each executable file, MSGBIND specifies which message files
to scan, and for each message file, it specifies which messages to include
in the executable file. Although the resulting executable file will be larger,
access to messages will be faster.
<P>
In the OS/2 operating system, message segment/objects are packed with other
application code. If the size of the code segment/object and the bound messages
exceeds 64KB, the following statement in the program definition file (.DEF)
isolates the application code from the message statement/object:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
