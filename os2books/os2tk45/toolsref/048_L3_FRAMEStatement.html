<H1>FRAME Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 49 -->
<P>
The<B> FRAME</B> statement defines a frame window.  The statement defines
the title, identifier, position, and dimensions of the frame window, as
well as the window style.  The<B> FRAME</B> statement is most often used
in a<B> WINDOWTEMPLATE</B> statement, and typically, only one<B> FRAME</B> statement
is used.  The<B> FRAME</B> statement, in turn, typically contains at least
one<B> WINDOW</B> statement that defines the client window belonging to
the frame window.
<P>
The frame window has no default style.  You must use the<I> framectl</I> field
to define additional frame controls, such as a title bar and system menu,
to be created when the frame window is created.  If the text field is not
empty, the statement automatically adds a title-bar control to the frame
window, whether or not you specify the FCF_TITLEBAR style.  Frame controls
are given default styles and control identifiers based on their class.  For
example, a title-bar control receives the identifier FID_TITLEBAR.
<P>
The<B> FRAME</B> statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL,
DIALOG, and WINDOW statements. Typically, a<B> FRAME</B> statement contains
one<B> WINDOW</B> statement.

<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example creates a standard frame window, with title bar, a system menu,
minimize and maximize boxes, and a vertical scroll bar.  The<B> FRAME</B> statement
contains a<B> WINDOW</B> statement defining the client window belonging
to the frame window.
