<P>
<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
The MARKEXE program enables you to view and set the program type for an
executable file. For applications running on OS/2 for SMP Version 3, MARKEXE
enables you to set the MPUNSAFE bit, which forces the application to be
run in uniprocessor mode.
<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
Use MARKEXE with the OS/2 Linear Executable Linker (Link386) or the OS/2
Segmented Executable Linker (LINK) to change or set the program type of
programs you have created, and to set or unset the MPUNSAFE bit. For more
information see <A HREF="226_L1_ViewandSetProgramTyp.html">View and Set
Program Type For Executable File (MARKEXE)</A>.
