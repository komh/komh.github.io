<UL>
<P>
L2000<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> imported starting address
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B>  A MODEND, or starting address record, referred to
an imported name. Imported program-starting addresses are not supported.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The starting address record must refer to a non imported
name. Edit the source file and recompile or reassemble.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2002
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>fix-up overflow at<I> location</I> in segment<I> name
</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A fix up overflow occurred near<I> location</I>, in
the named segment. See <A HREF="487_L3_ConditionsThatCanCau.html">Conditions
That Can Cause LINK386 Error 2002</A>.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Revise the source file and re-create the object file. If
that does not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2003
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>inter segment self-relative fix-up at<I> location
</I>in segment<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> LINK386 detected an inter segment self-relative fix-up.
A self-relative fix-up cannot be in another segment. This is probably caused
by a near reference to procedure located in another segment.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Revise the source file and re-create the object file. If
that does not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2005
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>fix-up type unsupported at<I> location</I> in segment
<I>name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B>  LINK386 detected an unsupported fix up type. This
is probably a compiler or assembler error.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Revise the source file and re-create the object file. If
that does not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2010
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>too many fix-ups in LIDATA record
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B>  There are more fix ups applying to a LIDATA record
than will fit into the LINK386's 1024 byte buffer. The buffer is divided
between the data in the LIDATA record itself and the run-time relocation
items.  These are 8 bytes each, so the maximum varies from 0 to 128.  This
is probably a compiler error.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Revise the source file and re-create the object file. If
that does not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2011
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: NEAR/HUGE conflict
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B>  There are conflicting NEAR and HUGE attributes for
a communal variable. This error can occur only with programs produced by
compilers that support communal variables.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Specify only one of these attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2012
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: array-element size mismatch
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> A far communal array has been declared with two or
more different array-element sizes (for example, an array declared once
as an array of characters and once as an array of real numbers). This error
occurs only when using compilers that support far communal arrays.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Match the definitions and re-create the object module or
modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2013<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> LIDATA record
too large
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A LIDATA record in an object module contains more than
512 bytes of data. It is likely that one of your assembler modules contains
a complex structure definition or a series of deeply-nested DUP operators.
(LIDATA is a DOS term.)
<BR>
<B>Example:</B>  The following structure definition causes this error:
<PRE>alpha   DB     10DUP(11 DUP(12 DUP(13 DUP(...))))
</PRE>

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Simplify the structure definition and reassemble the module.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L2022<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I> (alias
<I>internalname</I>) : export undefined
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A name has been directed to be exported but is not
defined anywhere.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file and define the export.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2023
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I> (alias<I> internalname</I>) : export
imported
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An imported name has been directed to be exported.
Items that are not in the source file itself cannot be exported. You cannot
export this imported name.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file to not export the imported name.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2024
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: special symbol already defined
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  Your program defined a symbol name that LINK386 already
used for one of its low-level symbols.  For example, the linker generates
special names for overlay support.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file and choose another name for the symbol.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L2025<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>: symbol
defined more than once
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A symbol has been defined more than once in the object
file.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file, removing the extra symbol definition.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L2026<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> entry ordinal<I> number,
name name</I> : multiple definitions for same ordinal
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  More than one entry<!-- entering slot 506 --> point
name has been assigned to the same ordinal in the module definition file.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the module definition file to correct the usage of
the ordinal.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2027<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> number</I>:
ordinal too large for export
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  You tried to export more than 3072 names or indicated
too large of an ordinal.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file or define smaller ordinals in the module
definition file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2029<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> string</I>:
unresolved external
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> A symbol declared to be external in one or more modules
was not found among the given objects and libraries.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Supply files that will resolve these external calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2030
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>starting address not code (use class 'CODE')
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  You specified a starting address to LINK386 that is
not within a segment of type 'CODE.'
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reclassify the segment to CODE, or correct the starting
point.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2044<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> string</I>:
symbol multiple defines, use /NOE
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The symbol shown was defined more than once, perhaps
for different things.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile with the /NOEXDICTIONARY option.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2047
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>IOPL attribute conflict - segment:<I> name</I> in
group:<I>name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The segment indicated within the group shown has different
IOPL attributes from the rest of the segments in the group.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Remove the segment from the group or make sure all segments
have the same IOPL attributes. Relink.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2050<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> use16/use32
attribute conflict - segment:<I>name</I> in group:<I>name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The segment indicated within the group shown has a
different USE16/USE32 attribute from the rest of the segments in the group.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Remove the segment from the group or make sure all segments
have the same USE16/USE32 attribute.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2052<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>:
unresolved external - possible calling convention mismatch
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered an undefined external, which could
be a fast-call/C-call mismatch.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Make sure the external is defined and called the same way
(for example, all C-calls).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2053<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> call
gates are NOT allowed in 32-bit object if its size exceeds 64K - memory
object number<I> number</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The memory object indicated is larger than 64K and
uses call gates.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Remove the call gates or break the object into smaller portions.
 Relink.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2054<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> data for
invalid page in segment<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered data past the defined end of initialized
data in the segment indicated.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>   The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2055
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>fix-up for invalid page at<I> location</I> in segment
<I>name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered a fixup past the defined end of
initialized data in the segment indicated.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2056
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>object type conflict - segment:<I> name</I> in group:
<I>name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The segment indicated within the group shown has a
different TYPE attribute from the rest of the segments in the group.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Remove the segment from the group or make sure all segments
have the same TYPE attribute.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2057<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> duplicate
of<I> name</I> with different size found; record ignored
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered two COMDAT records with the selection
type "SAME SIZE." The records have the same name but have different sizes.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2058
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>different duplicate of<I> name</I> found; record
ignored
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered two COMDAT records with the selection
type "EXACT." The records have the same name but have different sizes.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2059
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>size of the data block associated with<I> name</I> exceeds
4G
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered a continuation COMDAT record whose
additional size made the communal data too large.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L2061
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>no space for the data block associated with<I> record
name</I> inside the<I> segment name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  While being allocated space for a COMDAT record inside
the segment indicated, the segment grew larger than 64K.

<UL> continuation
of COMDAT<I> name</I> has conflicting attributes; record ignored
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  While concatenating the COMDAT record indicated, LINK386
found attributes that differ from those defined in the initial COMDAT record.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The .OBJ is probably corrupted. Recompile or reassemble
and try again.  If that does not work, contact your<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
