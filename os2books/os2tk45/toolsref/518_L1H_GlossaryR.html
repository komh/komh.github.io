like a round button on the screen, that can be in a checked or unchecked
state. It is used to select a single item from a list. Contrast with<I> check

text beside it. Radio buttons are combined to show a user a fixed set of
choices from which only one can be selected. The circle is partially filled
when a choice is selected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
