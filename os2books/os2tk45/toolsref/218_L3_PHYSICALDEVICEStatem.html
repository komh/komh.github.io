<B>Syntax:</B> PHYSICAL DEVICE [drivername]
<P>
This statement identifies the executable file as a physical device driver.

<P>
If &lt;drivername&gt; is given, it becomes the name of the driver as it
is known by OS/2. This name can be any valid file name. If &lt;drivername&gt;
is not given, the name of the executable file - with the extension removed
- becomes the name of the driver.
