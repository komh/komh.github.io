<H1>Creating a List File</H1><!-- entering slot 357 -->
<P>
To use a list file with PACK, you must first create a file that contains
the names of the files you want to compress. You can give the list file
any name. Following is an example of specifying a list file at the command
line.
<PRE>  PACK DEVICE.LST DEVICE.DRV /L
</PRE>

<P>
The /L indicates that DEVICE.LST is a list file. If the list file is not
in the working directory, you must specify the drive and path. Global file-name
characters are not permitted in the list-file name. DEVICE.DRV is the destination
file for the end-to-end-compressed data. (End-to-end compressed data is
the data from each of the files contained in the list file. This data is
stored in a contiguous format in the destination file.)
<P>
The syntax used in the list file is similar to that used in the command
line. The syntax for a single line in the list file follows:
<PRE>  sourcefile
    [/H:headerpath\
    |/H:headerfile
    |/H:headerpath\ headerfile]
    [/D:headerdate]
    [/T:headertime]
    [/C]
</PRE>

<P>
When using the list-file method (method 2), global file-name characters
are not permitted in the source-file name. Notice also that "PACK" is excluded
and<I> packedfile</I> is not permitted in the list file, because they were
specified on the command line. You can include comments or blank lines by
entering a semicolon as the first character of the line. An example of a
list file follows.
<PRE>  ;This is a comment
  C:\OS2\COMMAND.COM
  CONFIG.SYS /H:CONFIG.BAK /C
  \OS2\INSTALL\DDINSTAL.EXE
   /H:\OS2\DDINSTAL.TMP
   /D:10-15-91 /T:11.45
</PRE>
