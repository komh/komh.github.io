<H1>BOOKSHELF Online Documents</H1><!-- entering slot 120 -->
<P>
The KwikINF window includes a<B> Volume to Search</B> list box of all online
documents stored in the OS/2 BOOKSHELF subdirectories. KwikINF initiates
searches for information in any online document in this list.
<P>
The BOOKSHELF is an environment variable, set in CONFIG.SYS, that contains
a list of subdirectories containing online documents created as viewable
.INF files with the Information Presentation Facility (IPF). The BOOKSHELF
environment variable is set as follows:
<P>
SET BOOKSHELF=&lt;<I>subdirectory</I>&gt;;...;&lt;<I>subdirectory</I>&gt;;

<P>
Online documents for OS/2 (for example, the Command Reference) are stored
in the \OS2\BOOK subdirectory of the drive on which OS/2 is installed.  Online
documents for the OS/2 Toolkit (for example, the Programming References)
are stored in the \TOOLKIT\BOOK subdirectory of the drive specified during
installation of the online programming information. As an example, after
installation of OS/2 and the Toolkit, the BOOKSHELF environment variable
is set as follows:
<P>
SET BOOKSHELF=C:\OS2\BOOK;D:\TOOLKIT\BOOK;
<P>
Where c: is the drive where OS/2 is installed and D: is the drive where
the Toolkit is installed.
<P>
The online document where KwikINF looks for the<B> Search String</B> is
selected from the<B> Volume to Search</B> list box by KwikINF or by you.
KwikINF selects the<B> Volume to Search</B> by looking for the text string
that has a matching entry in the KwikINF index file or, if there is no matching
entry in the index file, in the<B> Default Volume</B> you have selected
in the Configure KwikINF window.
