L1050<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> too many groups in one module
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 found more than 32 group definitions (GRPDEF)
in a single module.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of group definitions by splitting the
module, by eliminating one or more group definitions, or combining group
definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1051<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> too many
groups
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The program defines more than 32 groups in addition
to DGROUP.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of group definitions by splitting the
module, by eliminating one or more group definitions, or combining group
definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1052<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> too many
libraries
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  You tried to link with more than 32 libraries.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Combine libraries, or use modules that require fewer libraries.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1053<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> out of memory for
symbol table
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The program has more symbolic information, such as
public, external, segment, group, class, and file names, than the amount
that could fit in available real memory.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Combine modules or segments and recreate the object files.
Eliminate as many public symbols as possible or use shorter names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1054
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>requested segment limit too high
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  There is not enough memory to allocate the necessary
tables for the amount of segments requested.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of segments by combining or creating additional
executable modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1057<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> data
record too large
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A LEDATA record (in an object module) contained more
than 1024 bytes of data. This is a translator (compiler or assembler) error.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Note which translator (compiler or assembler) produced the
incorrect object module and the circumstances, and contact your supplier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1060<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> program exceeds<I> number
</I>bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B> There is not enough memory to process all segments.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B> Reduce the number of segments by combining or creating additional
executable modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1063<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> out
of memory for debugging information
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 was given too many object files with debug
information, and ran out of space to store them.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of object files that have debug information.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1064<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> out of memory -<I> name
</I>heap exhausted
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The linker ran out of heap space;<I> name</I> = near
or far.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of background processes or install more
memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1070<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>:
segment size exceeds 64K
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A single segment contains more than 64K of code or
data. This could be because you attempted to combine identically named segments.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Try compiling (or assembling) and linking using a larger
memory model or breaking up the named segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1071
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>segment _TEXT larger than 65,520 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  This error is likely to occur only in small-model C
programs, but it can occur when any program with a segment named _TEXT is
linked using the /DOSSEG option of the LINK386 command. Small-model C programs
must reserve code addresses 0 and 1; the reserve is increased to 16 for
alignment purposes.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Make the program source code smaller, or change to a larger
memory model.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1072<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> common
area longer than 65,536 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The program has more than 64K of communal variables.
This error occurs only with programs produced by compilers that support
communal variables.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Rewrite your program using fewer or smaller communal variables.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1073<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> file-segment limit
exceeded
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  There are more than 255 physical or file segments.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of physical or file segments. You could
use the Combine Contiguous Data (/PACKD) option for combining data segments
or the Combine Contiguous Code (/PACKC) option for combining code segments.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1074<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>: group
larger than 64K
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A group contains segments that total more than 65,536
bytes.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number or size of segments or remove segments
from the group.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1075<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> entry
table larger than 65,535 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  You have exceeded a linker table size limit because
of an excessive number of entry names.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of names in the modules that you are linking
or create additional executable modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1076<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>:
segment size exceeds<I> number</I>M
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The named segment is larger than the specified size.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Break the segment into smaller segments and try again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1077
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>common area longer than 4G-1 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The space for the C languages common area is too big.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B> <!-- entering slot 502 --> If the load module is an .EXE,
consider putting some routines in .DLL; otherwise, link without debugging
information or create additional executable modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1080
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>cannot open list file
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The disk or a directory is full, or an invalid file

<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1089<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> filename</I>: cannot
open response file
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 cannot find the specified response file. This
usually indicates a typing error.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Include the drive specifier or path, or both, for the response
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1091<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
