<H1>Creating Icons for Specific Displays</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
Although the Icon Editor edits and saves a device-independent form of the
icon, the<B> Device</B> menu enables you to create versions of the icon
for specific display devices.
<P>
An independent form is automatically created when you create a new icon
or pointer and all other forms are derived from it.  If you select any of
the other device forms listed in the menu, a new form is created for the
specified device.  The<B> Custom</B> option enables you to create an icon
or pointer for any other device.
<P>
Select<B> List</B> to view a list of all existing forms, including custom
and standard forms.  Any item in this list can be selected and edited or
deleted.  However, you must have at least one device-independent form.  Select
<B>Add</B> in the list dialog to add a new device form.
<P>
Several icon bit maps can be saved in a single icon resource; when the icon
is saved, all versions are saved with it in a format that includes a device
resolution tag for each version.  When the icon is loaded from a resource
file, the display device resolution is matched against the device for which
each device-dependent icon was intended. If a match is found, that icon
is used.  If no match is found, the application uses the device-independent
icon, which always exists.
<P>
Figure files can contain any of the following forms to support multiple
devices:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Independent<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CGA (2 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->EGA (16 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->VGA (16 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->XGA/8514 (256 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->XGA/8514 (16 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->XGA/8514 Small Color Form (16 colors)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->XGA/8514 Small BW Form<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Custom<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Device-dependent icons are those that are designed for a particular display
resolution.
<P>
An application can display icons or bit maps in dialog boxes or windows.

<P>
The file-name extension depends on the type of resource you are creating.
 The Icon Editor produces a file with any of the following extensions:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
ICO for icons<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> PTR for pointers<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
BMP for bit maps<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The ICO, PTR, or BMP files must be referred to in the resource script file
for your application.  The external files containing icons, pointers, and
bit maps are all referred to in the resource script file by single-line
statements that have a similar format. For example:
<PRE>ICON    ID_MAINWND myprog.ico   /* Icon    */
POINTER ID_PTR     mypoint.ptr  /* Pointer */

BITMAP  ID_BMP     mybtmp.bmp   /* bit map  */
</PRE>

<P>
ICON, POINTER, and BITMAP keywords identify the resource type.
<P>
The resource type is followed by a symbolic name or integer identifier that
is used by your application to identify the resource.  For example, with
ICON, the ID_MAINWND identifier can be used by the application in the control
data parameter of the WinCreateWindow call (or as a parameter to the WinCreateStdWindow
call) that creates the frame of the main window of your application. The
OS/2 operating system then associates the icon with the main window.
<P>
The symbolic name or identifier can be followed by any loading and memory
options.
<P>
The last part of the statement is the file name and file type of the resource
created by the Icon Editor.  A fully qualified path name must be given if
the file is not in the current directory.  An icon that it used for a minimized
application should have the same file name as the executable file of the
application.
