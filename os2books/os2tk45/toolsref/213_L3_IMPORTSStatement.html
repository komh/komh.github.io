<H1>IMPORTS Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 218 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>IMPORTS
  importdefinitions
</PRE>

<P>
This statement defines the names of the functions imported for the application
or library.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The term<I> import</I> refers to the process of declaring
that a symbol is defined in another run-time module (a dynamic-link library).

<P>
Typically, LINK386 uses an import library to resolve external references
to dynamic-link symbols. However, the IMPORTS statement provides an alternative
for resolving these references within a module.
<P>
The IMPORTS keyword marks the beginning of the import definitions. This
keyword is followed by one or more import definitions, each on a separate
line. Each import definition corresponds to a particular function.
<P>
<B>Import-Definition Syntax</B>
<PRE>[internalname=]modulename.entry
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
&lt;internalname&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The name that the importing
module uses to call the function.  Thus, &lt;internalname&gt; appears in
the source code of the importing module, although the function can have
a different name in the module where it is defined.  By default, internalname
is the same as &lt;entry&gt;.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;modulename&gt;
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>The name of the application or library that contains
the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;entry&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The
function to be imported; can be a name or an ordinal value.  (Ordinal values
are set in an EXPORTS statement.) If an ordinal value is given, then &lt;internalname&gt;
is required.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A given function has a name for each of three different contexts.
 The function has a name used by the exporting module (where it is defined),
a name used as an entry point between modules, and a name as it is used
by the importing module (where it is called).  If neither module uses the
optional &lt;internalname&gt; field, the function has the same name in all
three contexts.  If either of the modules uses the &lt;internalname&gt;
field, the function may have more than one distinct name.
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>IMPORTS  Sample.SampleRead
  SampleA.SampleWrite
  ReadChar = Read.1
</PRE>

<P>
This example defines three functions to be imported:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SampleRead<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SampleWrite<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A function that has been assigned an ordinal value
of 1<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The functions are found in the modules Sample, SampleA, and Read, respectively.
The function from the Read module is referred to as ReadChar in the importing
module.  The original name of the function, as it is defined in the Read
module, may or may not be known.
