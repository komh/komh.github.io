You can use PACK and UNPACK to compress and expand files. The options, parameters,
and function for PACK2 are identical to PACK.

<P>
Data Compression (PACK) is a tool that reduces the size of a file by compressing
its data. Decompression (UNPACK) works in reverse and allows you to expand
files. You can use PACK for a single file or group of files, thereby reducing
the disk space required for your OS/2 application. The only difference between
PACK and PACK2 is that PACK2 has a better compression algorithm. For more
information see <A HREF="343_L1_PACKUNPACKandPACK2UN.html">PACK/UNPACK and
PACK2/UNPACK2</A>.
