<P>
NMAKE<I> inherits</I> all current environment variables as macros. For example,
if you have a PATH environment variable defined as PATH = C:\TOOLS\BIN,
the string C:\TOOLS\BIN  is substituted when you use PATH in the description
file.
<P>
You can redefine inherited macros by including a line such as the example
above in a description file.  While NMAKE is running, the macro takes on
the redefined definition.  When NMAKE terminates, however, the environment
variable resumes its original value.
<P>
The Override Environment Variables (/E) option disables inherited macro
redefinition. If you use this option, NMAKE ignores any attempt to redefine
an inherited macro.
