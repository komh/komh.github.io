<P>
Dialog boxes should be designed to clearly identify the information that
the user is required to complete. The following are a few Common User Access*
guidelines:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Lay out the controls in columns, starting at the upper-left
corner, for left-to-right or top-to-bottom scanning.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Vertically and horizontally align selection and entry
fields so that the cursor moves in a straight line.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Arrange the controls in the sequence in which the
user would complete them.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If there are only a few entry fields, locate them
at the top of the dialog box.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make groups of controls obvious by use of group boxes
and white space.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Align group boxes, where possible.  Group boxes can
be extended to the right to line up with other group boxes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use field identifiers to identify the purpose of single
and multiple groups of choices.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
