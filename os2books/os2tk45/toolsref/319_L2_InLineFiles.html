<P>
You might need to issue a command in the description file with a list of
arguments exceeding the command-line limit of the operating system. Just
as NMAKE supports the use of command files, it can also generate inline
files that are read as response files by other programs.
<P>
To generate an inline file, use the following syntax for your description
block:
<PRE>target : dependents
  command @&lt;&lt;[filename]
inline file text
&lt;&lt; [KEEP | NOKEEP]
</PRE>

<P>
All of the text between the two sets of double less-than signs (&lt;&lt;)
is placed into an inline file and given the name<I> &lt;filename&gt;.</I>
You can refer to the inline file at a later time by using<I> &lt;filename&gt;</I>.
 If<I> &lt;filename&gt;</I> is not given, NMAKE gives the file a unique
name in the directory specified by the TMP environment variable, if it is
defined.  Otherwise, NMAKE creates a unique file name in the current directory.

<P>
The inline file can be temporary or permanent.  If you do not specify otherwise,
or if you specify the keyword NOKEEP, the inline file is temporary.  Specify
KEEP to retain the file.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The at sign (@) is not part of the NMAKE syntax but is the
typical character used by utility programs (such as LINK386) to designate
a file as a response file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
