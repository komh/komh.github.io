<P>
The DESC parameter is used to produce a description for the tracepoint that
is output as the first line of formatted data. It should include the entry
point name of the procedure being traced and whether this is an entry or
return point. The descriptive string is enclosed in double quotes as for
a C language string. The DESC parameter is required if any FMT specifications
are present.
<P>
The recommended formats for such strings are as follows:
<PRE>        DESC="<I>name</I> Pre-Invocation",

        DESC="<I>name</I> Post-Invocation",
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
name<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> is the system component (in parentheses) followed
by the entry point name of the procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Pre-Invocation
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>identifies this tracepoint as an entry point, that
is, before the function has been executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Post-Invocation
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>identifies this tracepoint as a return point from
the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The words<B> Pre-Invocation</B> and<B> Post-Invocation</B> are not mandatory,
merely recommendations to be compatible with the base OS/2 tracepoints,
when formatted. If a tracepoint is inserted in the middle of a procedure
it will be appropriate to use different wording. The Trace Customizer does
not check the wording.
<P>
The following is an example of pre-invocation and post-invocation tracepoints:

<PRE>      TRACE  MINOR=0x0001,             TP=.DosOpen,
             DESC="(OS) DosOpen    Pre-Invocation",.....

      TRACE  MINOR=0x8001,
             TP=.DosOpen,RETEP,
             DESC="(OS) DosOpen    Post-Invocation",.....
</PRE>
