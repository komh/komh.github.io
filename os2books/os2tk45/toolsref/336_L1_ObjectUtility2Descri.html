<P>
Object Utility/2 is a Workplace-Shell object that provides a facility for
registering Workplace Shell classes, creating instances of Workplace Shell
classes, and modifying instances of Workplace Shell classes.
<P>
The following attributes can be set or modified for instances of Workplace
Shell objects:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Template<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Delete<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Rename<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Print<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Link<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Move<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Drag<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The attributes modify the behavior of the objects to allow or not allow
these actions. For example, the Template attribute allows you to create
a template. Some objects do not allow specific behaviors even if the attribute
is selected.
<P>
A Workplace Shell class must be registered with the Workplace Shell before
it will be recognized by Object Utility/2. After the object class is registered,
an instance of that class can be created. Object Utility/2 automates these
procedures of object-class registration and instantiation.  This tool can
create an instance of an object from a class that has already been instantiated,
or can modify an existing instance.
<P>
Registration of a class is performed by opening the main view of Object
Utility/2.  The class name and DLL name must be provided.  The class is
not registered if it has been registered previously.
<P>
To modify an existing instance, drag the icon representing the class and
drop it of Object Utility/2. You can enter the object ID and class name
after opening the main view.
<P>
After the item to be installed is dropped, a dialog box is displayed for
registration and instantiation information.
<P>
To destroy an object created by this tool, drag the object and drop it onto
the Shredder object on the Workplace Shell Desktop (if the<B> no drag</B> and
<B>no delete</B> options are not selected and the object allows deletion).
A mechanism to deregister an object class is not provided with this tool.
