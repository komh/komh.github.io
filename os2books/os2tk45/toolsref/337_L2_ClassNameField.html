<P>
Class name is a list of all the registered classes that have DLLs available
on your system.  The OS/2 operating system allows classes to be registered
without the DLLs available, but Object Utility/2 does not.  You can select
a class from the list or enter one manually.  The<B> Class Name</B> field
is required when registering a new class, modifying an existing instance
that was not dropped on Object Utility/2, or creating a new instance.
