<H1>EXPORTS Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 217 --><B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>EXPORTS
      exportdefinitions
</PRE>

<P>
This statement defines the names and attributes of the functions exported
to other modules and of the functions that run with I/O privilege.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The term<I> export</I> refers to the process of making a function
available to other run-time modules.  By default, functions are hidden from
other modules at run time.
<P>
Normally, the EXPORTS statement is meaningful only for functions within
dynamic-link libraries and for functions that execute with I/O privilege.

<P>
The EXPORTS keyword marks the beginning of the export definitions. Each
definition is entered on a separate line.  You need to give an export definition
for each dynamic-link routine you want to make available to other modules.

<P>
<B>Export-Definition Syntax</B>
<P>
entryname [=internalname] [@ord[RESIDENTNAME]] [pwords]<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
&lt;entryname&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The function name as it is known
to other modules.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;internalname&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The
actual name of the export function as it appears within the module itself;
by default, this name is the same as &lt;entryname&gt;.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;ord&gt;
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>The function's ordinal position within the module
definition table.  If this field is used, the function's entry point can
be invoked by name or by ordinal.  Use of ordinal positions is faster and
may save space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> RESIDENTNAME<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> Indicates
that the function's name be kept resident in memory at all times. This keyword
is applicable only if &lt;ord&gt; is used. If &lt;ord&gt; is not used, OS/2
automatically keeps the names of all exported functions resident in memory
by default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &lt;pwords&gt;<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The
total size of the function's parameters, as measured in words (bytes divided
by two). This field is required only if the function executes with I/O privilege.
When a function with I/O privilege is called, OS/2 consults &lt;pwords&gt;
to determine how many words to copy from the caller's stack to the I/O-privileged
function's stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<PRE>EXPORTS  SampleRead = read2bin @8
  StringIn = str1       @4 RESIDENTNAME
  CharTest  6
</PRE>

<P>
This example defines three export functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SampleRead<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->StringIn<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CharTest<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The first two functions can be accessed either by their exported names or
by an ordinal number. Note that in the module's own source code, these functions
are actually defined as read2bin and str1, respectively. The last function
runs with I/O privilege and therefore is given with the total size of the
parameters - six words.
