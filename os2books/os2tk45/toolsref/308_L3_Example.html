<PRE>.OBJ.EXE:
  LINK $&lt;;

EXAMPLE1.EXE: EXAMPLE1.OBJ

EXAMPLE2.EXE: EXAMPLE2.OBJ
  LINK /CO EXAMPLE2,,,LIBV3.LIB
</PRE>

<P>
The first line above defines an inference rule that causes the LINK command
to create an executable file whenever a change is made in the corresponding
object file.  The file name in the inference rule is specified with the
special macro $&lt; so that the rule applies to any .OBJ file with an out-of-date
executable file.
<P>
When NMAKE does not find any commands in the first description block, it
checks for a rule that might apply and finds the rule defined on the first
two lines of the description file.  NMAKE applies the rule, replacing $&lt;
with EXAMPLE1.OBJ when it executes the command, so that the LINK command
becomes
<PRE>LINK EXAMPLE1.OBJ;
</PRE>

<P>
NMAKE does not search for an inference rule when examining the second description
block, because a command is explicitly given.
