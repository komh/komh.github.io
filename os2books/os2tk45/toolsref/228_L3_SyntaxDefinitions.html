<H1>Syntax Definitions</H1><!-- entering slot 233 -->
<P>
MARKEXE has the following keywords, options, and program types. You can
also specify any number of files to be viewed or marked.
<P>
<B>KEYWORDS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
FORCE<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Marks the executable file with OS/2 as the
target operating system even though the file was marked for another operating
system. Using FORCE might produce internally inconsistent executable files.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>NO<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Sets the command to
the opposite condition. This keyword does not apply to the DISPLAY option
or any of the Program Type options.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>OPTIONS</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
DISPLAY<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Displays the application type in a message;
does not make any changes. (This is the default option.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DLLINIT
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Sets per process initialization for the dynamic
link library.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DLLTERM<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Sets
per process termination for the dynamic link library. (Use with LINK386
only.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LFNS<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Enables support
of long file names.  (Use with LINK only.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MPUNSAFE
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Marks the application as unsafe for running in
a multi-processor environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SETVERSION<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Extracts
vendor-specific values from text strings embedded into the executable module,
converts them into bitfields, and stores the result into a 32-bit "Module
Version" field in the executable header.  This field can be displayed with
the EXEHDR utility.  MARKEXE searches for version strings in the following
sections of the executable module:<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->The description field (established at link-time by
a DESCRIPTION statement in the module definition file).<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->The .ENHVERSION extended attribute, if present.<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->Throughout the body of the executable module.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Only one option may be entered on the command line.
<P>

<P>
<B>PROGRAM TYPES</B>
<P>
MARKEXE does not modify the file if the executable file's program type is
the same as the requested type. It displays a message instead.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
WINDOWAPI<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> The application is a Presentation Manager
application and can run in the Presentation Manager session only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WINDOWCOMPAT
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>The application can run in a Presentation Manager
window or in an full-screen session.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> NOTWINDOWCOMPAT
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>The application must run in an OS/2 full-screen
session.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> UNSPECIFIED<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> The
application type is not known. By default, the OS/2 operating system will
force the program to run in a full-screen session.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Specifying an incorrect program type might cause undesirable
results when you try to run that program. For example, do not change a WINDOWCOMPAT
program to WINDOWAPI.
<P>
Only one program type may be entered on the command line.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
