<H1>Targets in Several Description Blocks</H1><!-- entering slot 298 -->
<P>
Using a file as a target in more than one description block causes NMAKE
to end.  You can overcome this limitation by using two colons (::) as the
target/dependent separator instead of one colon.
<P>
The following description block is permissible:
<PRE>X :: A
  command
X :: B
  command
</PRE>

<P>
The following causes NMAKE to end:
<PRE>X : A
  command
X : B
  command
</PRE>

<P>
It is permissible to use single colons if the target/dependent lines are
grouped above the same commands. The following is permissible:
<PRE>X : A
X : B
  command
</PRE>
<B>Double Colon (::) Target/Dependent Separator Example</B>
<PRE>TARGET.LIB :: A.ASM B.ASM C.ASM
  ML A.ASM B.ASM C.ASM
  LIB TARGET -+A.OBJ -+B.OBJ -+C.OBJ;

TARGET.LIB :: D.C E.C
  ICC /C D.C E.C
  LIB TARGET -+D.OBJ -+E.OBJ;
</PRE>

<P>
These two description blocks update the library named TARGET.LIB.  If any
of the assembly-language files have changed more recently than the library
file, NMAKE executes the commands in the first block to assemble the source
files and update the library.  Similarly, if any of the C-language files
have changed, NMAKE executes the second group of commands to compile the
C files and update the library.
