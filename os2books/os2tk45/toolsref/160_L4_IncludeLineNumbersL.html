<H1>Include Line Numbers (/L)</H1><!-- entering slot 165 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>  /L[INENUMBERS]
<P>
This option includes source file line numbers and associated addresses in
the map file.  In addition, you must give LINK386 an object file (or files)
with line number information.  You can use the /Zd option with most compilers
to include line numbers in the object file.  If you give LINK386 an object
file without line number information, the /L option has no effect. The option
for CSET/++ is /ti.
<P>
The /L option forces LINK386 to create a map file even if you did not explicitly
tell LINK386 to create a map file.  By default, the file is given the same
base name as the executable file, plus the extension .MAP.  You can override
the default name by explicitly specifying a map file name.
