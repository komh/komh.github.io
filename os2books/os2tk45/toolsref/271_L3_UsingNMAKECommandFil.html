<H1>Using NMAKE Command Files</H1><!-- entering slot 278 -->
<P>
A command file is a<I> response file</I> used to extend command-line input
to NMAKE.
<P>
You can split input to NMAKE between the command line and a command file.
Use the name of a command file (preceded by @) where you normally type the
input information on the command line.
<P>
<B>Why Use a Command File?</B>
<P>
Use a command file for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Complex and long commands you type frequently<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Strings of command-line arguments, such as macro definitions,
that exceed the limit for command-line length
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A command file is not the same as a description file. For
information about description files, see <A HREF="288_L2_DescriptionFiles.html">Description
Files</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Command-File Syntax</B>
<P>
To provide input to NMAKE with a command file, type
<PRE>NMAKE @commandfile</PRE>

<P>
For the &lt;commandfile&gt; parameter, enter the name of a file containing
the same information as is normally entered on the command line.
<P>
NMAKE treats line breaks that occur between arguments as spaces. Macro definitions
can span multiple lines if you end each line except the last with a backslash
(\).  Macro definitions that contain spaces must be enclosed by quotation
marks, just as if they were entered directly on the command line.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
The following is a command file called UPDATE:
<PRE>/S "program \
= flash" SORT.EXE SEARCH.EXE
</PRE>

<P>
You can use this command file by typing the following command:
<PRE>NMAKE @UPDATE
</PRE>

<P>
This runs NMAKE using:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The /S option<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The macro definition "program = flash"<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The targets specified as SORT.EXE and SEARCH.EXE<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The description file, MAKEFILE, by default<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that the backslash allows the macro definition to span two lines.
