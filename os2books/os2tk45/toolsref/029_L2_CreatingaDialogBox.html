<P>
To run the Dialog Editor, select<B> Dialog Editor</B> from the<B> Development
Tools</B> folder. The main window appears, displaying the menu bar choices
<B>File</B>,<B> Edit</B>,<B> Control</B>,<B> Arrange</B>,<B> Options</B>,
and<B> Help</B>. On line help that tells you how to use the editor is available
on most Dialog Editor windows.
<P>
To create a new dialog box, start with either of the following methods:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select<B> New Dialog</B> from the<B> Edit</B> menu.
The editor opens new files with the extensions .RES and .DLG.  This also
opens a new include file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select<B> New</B> from the<B> File</B> menu.  This
opens new files with the extensions .RES and .DLG. You can open a new include
file or an existing one.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When you edit a dialog box, the names of the resource and include files
are shown in the title bar of the Dialog Editor. If you are editing a new
file that has not yet been named or saved,<B> (Untitled)</B> appears in
the title bar in place of a name. If<B> (Untitled)</B> appears in the title
bar in place of a name, there are unsaved changes.
<P>
The<B> Dialog Box ID</B> field appears in the status area. A default integer
number is supplied in the entry field. Type a symbolic identifier for the
dialog box, such as MYDIALOG. Tab to the integer field and type the integer
number. Press Enter to place them both in the include file.
<P>
The new dialog box appears in the lower-left corner of the editor screen
enclosed by a border. The border contains eight small squares called drag
handles, which allow you to change the width and height of the selected
item.  This indicates that the dialog box is selected for editing.  If you
are creating a new dialog box, the dialog is automatically selected; at
all other times, before you edit the dialog box or a control, you must click
on it to select it.
<P>
To continue creating the new dialog box, follow these steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make the dialog box larger by clicking on one
of its drag handles with the left mouse button and dragging until the box
is the size you want it to be. This can be done in one operation by clicking
on the upper-right corner of the border and dragging diagonally upwards
and to the right.
<P>
Information about the item you are editing is displayed in the<B> Selected
Item Status</B> box in the left half of the status area.  As you move the
shadow box, the x-y-coordinates change.  These are the coordinates of the
origin of the dialog box relative to the origin of the window.  The cx-cy-coordinates
are the width and height of the dialog box.  The symbolic identifier is
also shown.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select<B> Styles</B> from the<B> Edit</B> menu.
The Dialog Box Styles pop-up window appears.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the text entry field in the status area,
and then type the dialog box title (for instance, Sample dialog box) into
the field.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Press Enter and the title appears at the top
of your dialog box.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You can reposition the entire dialog box by moving the pointer inside the
top area enclosed by the border, holding the left mouse button down, and
dragging the shadow box across the screen.  When the shadow box is in the
position where you want the dialog box to appear, release the mouse button.
 The dialog box appears in that position. Alternatively, you can move the
dialog box using the keyboard arrow keys.  You can reposition the dialog
box at any time during the edit.
