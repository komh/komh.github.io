<P>
The KwikINF window includes a list box of all online documents stored in
the OS/2 BOOKSHELF subdirectories.  KwikINF initiates searches for information
in any online document in this list. The online document where KwikINF looks
for the<B> Search String</B> is selected from the<B> Volume to Search</B> list
box by KwikINF or by you.  KwikINF selects the<B> Volume to Search</B> by
looking for the text string that has a matching entry in the KwikINF index
file or, if there is no matching entry in the index file, in the<B> Default
Volume</B> you have selected in the Configure KwikINF window. Or you can
override KwikINF's selection of the<B> Volume to Search</B> by making your
own selection from the list box.
<P>
You can also open and display the Contents of an online document by double-clicking
on an entry in this list box.
