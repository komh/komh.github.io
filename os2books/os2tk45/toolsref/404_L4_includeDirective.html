<B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>  include filename
</PRE>

<P>
The include directive causes RC to process the file specified in the filename
field.  This file should be a header file that defines the constants used
in the resource script file.  Only the #define directives in the specified
file are processed; all other statements are ignored by the Resource Compiler.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
filename<!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Specifies the OS/2 name of the file to
be included.  This value must be an ASCII string enclosed either in double
quotation marks (if the file is in the current directory) or in less-than
and greater-than characters (&lt;&gt;) (if the file is in the directory
specified by -i command-line options or by the INCLUDE environment variable).
 You must give a full path enclosed in double quotation marks if the file
is not in the current directory or in the directory specified by -i command-line
 options or by the INCLUDE environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
The filename field is handled as a C string.  Therefore, you must include
two backslashes wherever one is required in the path.  (As an alternative,
you can use a single forward slash (/) instead of two backslashes.)
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example processes the header files OS2.H and HEADERS\MYDEFS.H\I while
compiling the resource script file.
<PRE>#include &lt;os2.h&gt;#include "headers\\\\mydefs.h"
