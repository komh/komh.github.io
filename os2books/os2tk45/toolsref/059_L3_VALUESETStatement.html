<H1>VALUESET Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 60 -->
<P>
The<B> VALUESET</B> statement creates a value-set control within the dialog
window.  This control lets a user select one choice from a group of mutually
exclusive choices.  The<B> VALUESET</B> statement defines the identifier,
coordinates, dimensions, and attributes of a value-set control.  The predefined
class for this control is WC_VALUESET.  If you do not specify a style, the
default style is WS_TABSTOP and WS_VISIBLE. The<B> VALUESET</B> statement
is used only in a<B> DIALOG</B> or<B> WINDOW</B> statement.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example creates a value-set control at position (40, 40) within the
dialog window.  The value set control has a width of 220 character and a
height of 20 character units.  Its resource ID is 302.  The style specification
VS_ICON creates a control to show items in icon form.  The default styles
WS_TABSTOP and WS_VISIBLE are both in effect, though only WS_TABSTOP is
specified.
<PRE>#define    IDC_VALUESET     302
#define    IDD_VALUESETDLG  501
DIALOG "Value set", IDD_VALUESETDLG, 11, 11, 260, 240, FS_NOBYTEALIGN |

<P>
A dialog template can be in either of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A resource.res file (generated from the .DLG file
by the Resource Compiler)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A block of memory that has the DLGTEMPLATE data structure,
in which case you use WinCreateDlg to create the dialog box from the template.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The dialog template uses device-independent<I> dialog units</I> for the
coordinate system that define the layout of controls in the dialog box.

<P>
A dialog unit is expressed in terms of the<I> default standard character
size</I>, which can vary from device to device.  You do not need to put
code in your application to reformat the dialog box when displaying it on
different devices. (Dialogs might need editing if a different system font
is loaded.)  A horizontal dialog unit is 0.25 of the standard character
size. A vertical dialog unit is 0.125 of the standard character size. Dialog
units are expressed as offsets from the origin (lower-left corner) of the
dialog box.
<P>
A dialog template is a general structure.  It could be termed a window template,
because you can use it to define any window in an application.  If you prefer,
use the statement WINDOWTEMPLATE instead of DLGTEMPLATE, because it is functionally
identical. This could reduce the initialization phase of the application
to registering the application window classes and calling WinLoadDlg to
load the template.
<P>
If you use the Dialog Editor to define a standard window, you will have
to edit the resulting .DLG file to ensure that you have a client window
and the required parent-child relationships.  You will also have to use
WinLoadMenu in your application, to create a menu bar for the window, because
you cannot create menus using the Dialog Editor.
<P>
The .RES file is an object-format compiled version of the .DLG file, created
when the Dialog Editor compiles the dialogs. The Dialog Editor uses the
.RES file as input on any subsequent edit of the same dialog.  This means
that, if you use a text editor to fine-tune a .DLG file, and you want subsequently
to re-edit the dialog using the Dialog Editor, you must first use the Resource
Compiler to generate a new .RES file from the .DLG file.
<P>
<!-- entering slot 61 -->Your application can use either the .RES file output
by the Dialog Editor or a .RES file created from the .DLG file and the other
resources. If your application uses the .DLG file, it must be included by
the resource script file of your application.
<P>
The rcinclude statement includes the .DLG file created by the Dialog Editor;
for example:
<PRE>rcinclude dbe.dlg /* Includes .DLG file */</PRE>

<P>
The corresponding .H file created by the Dialog Editor must also be included
in the .RC file.
<P>
Using OS/2-defined control windows, OS/2 draws and operates the controls
specified in the resource file for your application. Controls are windows
and can be used within any other window.
