<P>
The Workplace Class List is a tool that creates a workplace object class
and an instance of a workplace object class. Workplace objects are constructed
using the System Object Model (SOM) protocol and are instances of one of
the following workplace object classes:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Predefined<!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> These classes are defined by the system.
Examples of predefined workplace object classes are WPObject, WPFileSys,
and WPAbstract.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Subclass<!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> These
classes are derived from existing predefined workplace object classes. They
add, remove, or change functions, but they retain the basic behaviors and
capabilities of the parent class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Replaced<!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
