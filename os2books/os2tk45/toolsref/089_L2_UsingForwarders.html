<H1>Using Forwarders</H1><!-- entering slot 93 -->
<P>
You use forwarders to combine several DLLs into one without having to relink
old applications. For example, if MOUCALLS and VIOCALLS were combined into
a single DLL called NEWLIB.DLL, then MOUCALLS and VIOCALLS could be replaced
with special DLLs containing forwarders to NEWLIB.DLL.

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->FWDSTAMP parses only the IMPORTS and EXPORTS section
of the module definition file.  FWDSTAMP does not verify the syntax of the
other sections.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When exported names already exist in the input file,
their attributes are kept, such as resident or nonresident names table,
and ordinal numbers.  Any new conflicting attributes are ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If there is no exported name, FWDSTAMP adds the one
defined by the EXPORTS statement in the module definition file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
