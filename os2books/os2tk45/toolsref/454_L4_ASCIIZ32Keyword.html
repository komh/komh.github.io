<H1>ASCIIZ32 Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 470 -->
<P>
This is used to log a string in a function compiled using 32-bit flat addressing
and is coded as:
<PRE>        ASCIIZ32=(address_spec,flag,maxlength),
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a 0:32 bit flat memory address specification
as described in <A HREF="456_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address Specification</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>flag<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a mandatory parameter
that identifies the level of indirection to be used on the address. The
<I>flag</I> may be one of the following:
<PRE>D[IRECT]
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...
IS
</PRE>

<P>
DIRECT implies that the address points to a memory location, the contents
of which are to be saved in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address points to a flat address pointer which is
dereferenced to obtain the target location to save in the trace buffer.
The optional asterisks denote the level of indirection, one for each level.
The indirect offsets iiiiiiii are added to or subtracted from the value
found at the given level of indirection.
<P>
IS (Indirect Segmented) means that the address points to a segmented address
pointer which is dereferenced to obtain the target location to save in the
trace buffer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> maxlength<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is
the maximum length of the string that will be saved in the trace buffer.
It should be no greater than MAXDATALENGTH. The actual length to be traced
will depend on where the zero terminating byte is found.
<P>
If<I> maxlength</I> is 0 an error message will be given, and this tracepoint
will be ignored.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> When using dynamic tracing, the OS/2 kernel does not place
the terminating null byte into the trace buffer; therefore the prefix byte
must be used by the Trace Formatter to obtain the length of the string.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
