<PRE>  GROUPBOX text, id, x, y, width, height [, style]
</PRE>

<P>
The GROUPBOX statement creates a group-box control.  The control is a rectangle
that groups other controls together.  The controls are grouped by drawing
a border around them and displaying the given text in the upper-left corner.
 The GROUPBOX statement, which you can use only in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement,
defines the text, identifier, dimensions, and attributes of a control window.
 The predefined class for this control is WC_STATIC.  If you do not specify
a style, the default style is SS_GROUPBOX and WS_TABSTOP.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
text<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies text that appears in the upper-left
corner of the control. This field must contain zero or more characters enclosed
in double quotation marks.  Character values must be in the range 1 through
255.  If a double quotation mark is required in the text, you must include
the double quotation mark twice.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>id<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control identifier.  This
value must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned
integer in the range of 1 through 65535, or a simple expression that evaluates
to a value in these ranges.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>x<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>y<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control.  This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>width<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the width of the control.  This
value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression consisting
of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The width
is in n-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>height<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the height of the control.
 This value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression
consisting of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.
 The height is in 1/8-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>style<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control styles.  This value
can be a combination of the styles specified for WC_STATIC. You can use
the bitwise OR (|) operator to combine styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
