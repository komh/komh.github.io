<H1>Ordering Control Groups</H1><!-- entering slot 33 -->
<P>
This option allows you to gather controls into groups and to change the
order in which the tab keys and arrow keys move the selection cursor around
the controls.
<P>
When you use group boxes to group controls, always create the group box
before the controls that are to go inside it.
<P>
It is good practice to put group markers around all separate groups of controls,
including putting a marker before the first control in the list.
<P>
The list box shows the order in which the selection cursor moves between
the controls when the user presses the arrow and tab keys. (The coordinate
position of a control when displayed in the dialog box does not affect the
order.)  Initially, the controls are listed in the order in which they were
created.
<P>
There are three functions involved in grouping controls:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Setting Group Markers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Setting Tab Markers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Moving Control Order<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Setting Group Markers</B>
<P>
To set up groups in a dialog that has various types of controls, follow
these steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select<B> Order Groups</B> from the<B> Arrange
</B>menu.  The<B> Groups - order</B> dialog is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the first radio button in the list box.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the<B> Group Marker</B> push button.
 A group marker is now displayed between the<B> Text</B> control and the
first radio button in the list.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Scroll down the list and click on the first push
button in the list. Click on the<B> Group Marker</B> push button.  This
has organized your controls into groups of text, radio buttons, check boxes,
and push buttons.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Setting Tab Markers</B>
<P>
After setting group markers, you will want to set tab-stops.  The controls
marked with an asterisk already have tab-stops.
<P>
To make the tab-stop at only the first control in each group, delete the
tab-stops from the second and third radio button and check box, following
these steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the second radio button in the list
to mark it.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the<B> Delete Tab</B> push button.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Repeat the above steps for the third radio button,
and then perform the same operation for the second and third check box in
the list.  When this is complete, press Enter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Moving Control Order</B>
<P>
You can move controls in the list and then see during testing how the changes
affect the movement of the cursor. To change the position of a control in
the list, follow these steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Click on the name of the control to select it.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Position the pointer in the list where you want
the name to appear. The pointer changes shape to a short horizontal line
when it is over a place where you can insert the name.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To insert the control name, click the mouse button.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After grouping controls, you might want to test or edit the dialog, or enter
additional controls.
