<P>
PACK reduces the size of a file by compressing its data. You can use PACK
for a single file or for a group of files, thereby reducing the disk space
required for your OS/2 application.  UNPACK restores a packed file to it's
original size.
<P>
In addition to the original versions of these utility programs, enhanced
versions of the programs are also included with OS/2. These enhanced versions
are named PACK2 and UNPACK2. The options, parameters, and function for PACK2
and UNPACK2 are identical to PACK and UNPACK.  The only difference is that
PACK2 has a better compression algorithm.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> PACK and PACK2 are shipped with the OS/2 Toolkit. UNPACK and
UNPACK2 are shipped with OS/2.
