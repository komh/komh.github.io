<H1>Invoking the Trace Customizer</H1><!-- entering slot 445 -->
<P>
The Trace Customizer is a protect mode only program and must therefore be
run under OS/2. TRCUST may be invoked to combine TFF files or to process
a TSF. The syntax for combining TFF files is as follows:
<PRE>
    [d:][path]TRCUST [d:][path]tffsource /C=[d:][path]tffdest [/Wn]

</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
TRCUST<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> is the name of the Trace Customizer program.
A drive and path may optionally be specified to explicitly define the location
of the Trace Customizer program, otherwise the program is searched for in
the current directory, followed by looking along the path defined by the
PATH environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tffsource<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> is
the name of a file containing fully qualified (including extensions) pathnames
of TFF files to combine. Each TFF file must use the same major code and
each filename in the<B> tffsource</B> file is separated by white space.
This will combine all TFF files for the same major code into a single TFF
file.  If duplicate minor code format definitions are found, the first format
definition for the minor code remains valid, the duplicates are discarded
and a warning message is issued. If no path is provided the<B> tffsource
</B>file is searched for in the current directory, followed by using the
current value of DPATH.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tffdest<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> is
the name of the trace format destination file to store the combined trace
format definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Wn<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> (optional)
is the level of error messages to be displayed, where<B> n</B> can be 0,
1, or 2.  The possible message levels are shown below along with the messages
that each displays:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>
<P>
Level<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   0<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> fatal and severe messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   1<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> fatal, severe, and error messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   2<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> all (fatal, severe, error, and warning)
messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> A message level of 2 is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An example of a tffsource file for using the combine TFF files option of
TRCUST is:
<PRE>\TFF\PROG1\TRC00C2.TFF \TFF\PROG2\TRC00C2.TFF\TFF\PROG3\TRC00C2.TFF \TFF\PROG4\TRC00C2.TFF
</PRE>

<P>
To invoke TRCUST to combine TFF files using the above file as input (assume
filename is \TFF\PROG\TFF00C2) and output the combined format statements
into file \TFF\PROG\TR\TRC00C2.TFF is:
<PRE>TRCUST \TFF\PROG\TFF00C2 /C=\TFF\PROG\TRC00C2.TFF
</PRE>

<P>
The syntax for processing a TSF file is as follows:
<PRE>   [d:][path]TRCUST [d:][path]tsf [[d:][path]tdf] [/M=mapfile] [/Wn]
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
TRCUST<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> is the name of the Trace Customizer program.
A drive and path may optionally be specified to explicitly define the location
of the Trace Customizer program, otherwise the program is searched for in
the current directory, followed by looking along the path defined by the
PATH environment variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tsf<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> is
the name of the trace source file. If no file extension is provided then
an extension of TSF is assumed. If no path is provided the trace source
file is searched for in the current directory, followed by using the current
value of DPATH.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> [d:][path]tdf<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> (optional)
is the name of the trace definition file to store the dynamic tracepoint
definitions. If not specified, the TSF filename is used with an extension
of TDF. If no file extension is provided then an extension of TDF is assumed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>/M=mapfile<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> (optional) defines
<I>mapfile</I> as the MAP file for this module. The name may be qualified
by a drive/directory, otherwise it will be searched for in the current directory
followed by the path specified by the DPATH environment variable. If specified
as an option, the MAP file must exist and the filename extension must be
MAP or TRCUST will abort processing. The mapfile will only be used if a
symbol is not found in the symbolic debug information stored in the executable
module.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /Wn<!-- lm: 0x12 11 -->
<UL> (optional)
is the level of error messages to be displayed, where<B> n</B> can be 0,
1, or 2.  The possible message levels are shown below along with the messages
that each displays:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>
<P>
Level<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   0<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> fatal and severe messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   1<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> fatal, severe, and error messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>   2<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> all (fatal, severe, error, and warning)
messages<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL> A message level of 2 is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
