<P>
L1100<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> stub .EXE file invalid
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The stub file specified in the module definition file
is not a valid .EXE file.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Ensure that the stub file is an executable file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1101
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>invalid object module
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  One of the object modules was incorrectly formed during
compilation or assembly.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble your source code. If the error persists,
contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1102<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> unexpected
end-of-file
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An invalid format for a library was found.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Restore the library file from your backup disk and restart
LINK386. If this does not work, rebuild your library or contact your supplier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1103<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>: attempt
to access data outside segment bounds
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> A data record in an object module specified data extending
beyond the end of a segment. This is a translator error.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Note which translator (compiler or assembler) produced the
incorrect object module and the circumstances, and contact your supplier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1104<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> filename</I>: not
valid library
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The specified file is not a valid library file. This
error causes LINK386 to stop running.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Ensure that the named file is a valid library file and restart
LINK386. If this does not work, rebuild your library or contact your supplier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1105<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> invalid object due
to aborted incremental compile
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An object file from an aborted compile is trying to
be linked.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile the source that produced the bad compile and then
relink.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1106<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> unknown COMDAT
allocation type for<I> name</I>; record ignored
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The COMDAT (record in .OBJ) allocation type for the
named COMDAT was not valid.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble .OBJ and try again. If that does
not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1107<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> unknown
COMDAT selection type for<I> name</I>; record ignored
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The COMDAT (record in .OBJ) selection type for the
named COMDAT is not valid.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble .OBJ and try again. If that does
not work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1108<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> invalid
format of debugging information
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An error was detected in a segment that contains debug
information.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble and try again. If that does not
work, try relinking without using the /DE or /CO options.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1113
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>unresolved COMDEF; internal error
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered a COMDEF (record in .OBJ) in pass
2 that was not defined in pass 1.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble and try again. If that does not
work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1114<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> unresolved
COMDAT<I> name</I>: internal error
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 found specified COMDAT in pass 2 that does
not correspond to COMDATs found in pass 1.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble and try again. If that does not
work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1117<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> unallocated
COMDAT<I> name</I>; internal error
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The linker encountered COMDAT in pass 2 for which space
was not allocated during pass 1.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble and try again. If that does not
work, contact your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1121<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>:
group larger than 4G-1 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The group indicated is too large.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile or reassemble and try again. Remove segments from
the group or create additional executables if necessary.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1123
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: segment defined both 16- and 32-bit

<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The segment named was defined as both 16-bit and 32-bit.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Create two segments (one for 16-bit, one for 32-bit), or
make sure the segment is defined one way and relink.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1126
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>conflicting IOPL-parameter-words value
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The IOPL parameter words in the .DEF file does not
exactly match those in the corresponding EXPDEF object record.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Make sure .DEF file coincides with that defined in .OBJ.
Relink.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1128<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> too many nested
include files in module-definition file
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The .DEF file exceeded a nesting level.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Combine some nestings into one .DEF file and try again.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L1129<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> missing or bad include
file name
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 could not find a file included by .DEF file.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Make sure the file exists and can be located and that any
path is specified correctly. Try again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L1130<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> internal
fix-up applied to undefined area at<I> offset</I> in object<I> number</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 attempted to apply an internal fix-up beyond
the defined limits of the object.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  This is probably a compiler or assembler error. Revise the
source file and re-create the object file. If that does not work, contact
your supplier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
