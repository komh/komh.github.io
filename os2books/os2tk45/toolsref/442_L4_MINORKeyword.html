<P>
The MINOR parameter is an optional keyword parameter.  If it is specified
in the first tracepoint definition, it must be specified in every tracepoint
definition.  If it is not specified in the first tracepoint definition,
it cannot be specified in any of the subsequent tracepoint definitions.
It should be coded as:
<PRE>        MINOR=nnnnn,
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
nnnnn<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> is a decimal number from 1 to 65535 or a hex
number from 0x1 to 0xFFFF. This represents the minor code for the tracepoint,
which must be unique for the major code specified for this module. When
tracepoints with duplicate minor codes are encountered, the first is saved
and the rest are discarded, and an error message is issued.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If minor codes are not specified in the TSF, TRCUST sequentially provides
them, starting with 1, for each tracepoint definition it encounters.
