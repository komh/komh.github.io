<H1>Explanation of Command-Line Options</H1><!-- entering slot 362 -->
<P>
The -d option is useful for passing conditional-compilation flags to the
preprocessor. The &lt;defname&gt; is a sequence of letters, underscore symbols,
and digits which does not begin with a digit. The &lt;value&gt; is a sequence
of symbols which you want to substitute for the &lt;defname&gt; wherever
it appears in the input script file.  If you omit the =&lt;value&gt;, the
&lt;defname&gt; will be set to the default value 1. For example, the option
-d _3d is equivalent to including at the beginning of the input file this
line:
<P>
#define   _3d     1
<P>
You can use the -d option up to 8 times to define different macros from
the command line.
<P>
The -i option defines paths for files to be included with the source file.
The &lt;pathspec&gt; is any path where you want RC to search for files included
by the preprocessor #include directive.  The &lt;pathspec&gt; must not contain
embedded blanks.  To include more than one path, code the -i option once
for each path.  The preprocessor reads paths from the INCLUDE environment
variable after reading the paths you provide with -i options.
<P>
The -r option will create in your current directory a binary resource file
containing the resources you compile.  The -r option takes no argument.
 The name given to this binary resource file will be the same as the name
of the input resource script file except that the extension will be .RES
instead of .RC. When you use -r, you do not bind resources to an executable
file.
<P>
The -p option is used only when binding resources to an executable.  It
positions resources so that they do not cross 64K boundaries.
<P>
The -cp option is used to specify code page information for the resource
script file to be compiled. The &lt;codepage&gt; is a numeric code page
value. For a list of code page values, see the code page table under COUNTRYCODE
in the online book<I> OS/2 Warp Control Program Programming Reference</I>.

<P>
The -x option is used only when binding resources to an executable.  It
causes resources to be compressed.  These resources will be decompressed
automatically when the resource is accessed.
<P>
The -x1 option causes Resource Compiler to use the compression algorithm
that is compatible with OS/2 2.0, 2.1, and 2.11, as well as OS/2 3.0 and
later.
<P>
The -x2 option causes Resource Compiler to use a compression algorithm that
is compatible with OS/2 3.0 and later. The -x2 option will produce smaller
executable files that can access resources faster.
<P>
-x with no number defaults to -x1.
<P>
The -n option (nologo) causes Resource Compiler to suppress the display
of the logo and the copyright information.
<P>
The -w2 option causes Resource Compiler to suppress the display of all warning
and informational messages. Errors and fatal errors continue to be displayed.

<P>
The -h and -? options cause Resource Compiler to display a summary of the
available options and environment variables that it uses.  When you use
these options, Resource Compiler does not read any input files. Entering
"RC" on the command line with no operands displays the same information.
