<P>
The messages generated by the Trace Customizer are given below. In addition
to the message itself, the source line in error is displayed.
<P>
Errors in the FATAL and SEVERE category will cause the compiler to abort
immediately.
<P>
ERROR messages will normally cause a tracepoint definition to be discarded
and processing continues with the next definition.
<P>
WARNING messages will allow a valid tracepoint definition to be produced,
and the results will normally be as expected.
