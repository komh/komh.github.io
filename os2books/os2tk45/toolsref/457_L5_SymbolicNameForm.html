<H1>Symbolic Name Form</H1><!-- entering slot 473 -->
<P>
This is coded as:
<PRE>        .name[{+|-}nnnnnnnn]...[{+|-}(iiiiiiii)],
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
name<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> is a symbolic name of a memory location. The
"." is required before the<B> name</B> The debug information in the module
is checked for the<B> name</B>. If the debug information for the name is
not found and a MAP was given, the MAP is checked. An error message is output
by the Trace Customizer if the symbol is not found and the trace definition
is ignored.
<P>
The<B> name</B> is case sensitive except under the conditions that follow:

<P>
If the procedure containing<B> name</B> was not compiled with debug option
then if<B> name</B> is a C language symbolic name it will be case sensitive
and begin with an underscore (_) character unless it was declared with the
Pascal naming convention, in which case the underscore is omitted and<B> name
</B>is capitalized.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> nnnnnnnn<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> (optional)
is a displacement from the symbolic address. If hex the syntax is 0xnnnnnnnn.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>iiiiiiii<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> (optional) is a
displacement from the indirect address. If hex the syntax is 0xiiiiiiii.
This specifies a displacement from the final address when using INDIRECT,
IF (Indirect Flat) or IS (Indirect Segmented) addressing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
