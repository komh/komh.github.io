<P>
The Icon Editor lets you create your own art (icons, pointers, and bit maps)
and save them for use by applications.
<P>
Icons, pointers, and bit maps produced by the Icon Editor are graphic symbols
that are made up of pels (also known as pixels) in any of the following
display states:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Black<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->White<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Color<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Screen (background color)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inverse screen (inverse of background color)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application can use an icon to represent a minimized standard window.
 For example, an application that lists telephone numbers could use a telephone
icon when minimized.  An application can also use icons as warning symbols
in message boxes (for example, an exclamation mark or an upraised hand).

<P>
An application can associate a pointer with the mouse or similar pointing
device, so that the user can move the pointer around the screen to select
controls or text.  A pointer could also be used in an interactive graphics
application to draw graphics on the screen. For example, a free-hand graphics-drawing
application could use a pencil shape to represent the pointer.
