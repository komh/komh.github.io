<H1>View and Set Program Type For Executable File (MARKEXE)</H1><!-- entering slot 231 -->
<P>
The MARKEXE program enables you to view and set the program type for an
executable file. The program type identifies the OS/2 sessions in which
a program can run.
<P>
For applications running on OS/2 for SMP Version 3, MARKEXE enables you
to set the MPUNSAFE bit, which forces the application to always run in uniprocessor
mode. See <A HREF="231_L3_RequirementsforMulti.html">Requirements for Multi-Processing
</A>for information on when to set the MPUNSAFE bit.
<P>
Use MARKEXE with the OS/2 Linear Executable Linker (LINK386) or the OS/2
Segmented Executable Linker (LINK) to change or set the program type of
programs you have created and to set or unset the MPUNSAFE bit.
<P>
You can set DLL initialization and termination and also enable long file
name support. When using LINK386, you can set DLL initialization and termination;
long file name support is already set. When using LINK, you can set DLL
initialization and long file name support.
