<H1>Running PACK With a Listfile</H1><!-- entering slot 356 -->
<P>
You can start PACK with a single command from the command line. You can
type the name of a single file that contains a list of all the files you
want to compress.
<P>
Include the drive and path if the files are not in the working directory.
You can specify file names with any combination of uppercase and lowercase
letters. File-name extensions are not required; however, if you specify
a file name that has an extension, also type the extension.
<P>
The command-line syntax is as follows:
<PRE>  PACK listfile [packedfile] /L
    [/H:headerpath\
    |/H:headerfile
    |/H:headerpath\ headerfile]
    [/D:headerdate]
    [/T:headertime]
    [/C]
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
listfile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies the name of the file that contains
a list of files that are to be compressed. When naming a list file, do not
use global file-name characters.
<P>
For information about list files, see <A HREF="347_L4_CreatingaListFile.html">Creating
a List File</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> packedfile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies
the name of the file that will contain the compressed data. Files that contain
compressed data can be recognized by the @ symbol as the last character
in the file name. If you do not specify this parameter, PACK places the
compressed data in<I> sourcefile</I> and modifies its name to contain the
@ symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /L<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Indicates
that<I> filename</I> is a list file. A list file is not compressed; it simply
contains a listing of the names of the files that are to be compressed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>/H:headerpath\ or /H:headerfile or /H:headerpath\
headerfile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> These parameters can be used separately
or they can be paired.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<P>
<LI>H:headerpath\<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL> Specifies the destination path
(drive letters are not permitted) to be placed in the header of the file
that contains the compressed data. Unless this path is overridden with the
UNPACK command, it will be the destination path when the file is uncompressed.
<I>Headerpath</I> must end with a back slash (\).<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> /H:headerfile
<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL>Specifies the name of the file to be placed in
the header of the compressed file. This file name will be used as the destination
file for the uncompressed data and cannot be overridden.
<P>
If a header file name is not specified, PACK automatically uses<I> sourcefile
</I>as the name of the file that is placed in the header of the compressed
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> /H:headerpath\ headerfile<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL> Specifies
that both a destination path and a destination file name are to be placed
in the header of the file that has the compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /D:headerdate
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Records the date in the header of the file that
has the compressed data, and also in the destination file when it is uncompressed.

<P>
The date must follow the format /D:MM-DD-YYYY. For example: /D:08-20-1991
and /D:12-30-2010.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /T:headertime<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Records
the time in the header of the file that has the compressed data, and also
in the destination file when it is uncompressed.
<P>
The time must follow the format /T:HH.MM. For example /T:02.06 and /T:14.54.
Hour 00 represents 12 a.m. and hour 12 represents 12 p.m.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /C
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Specifies that the current path be placed in the
header of the file that contains the compressed data. When the UNPACK command
is used, this path will be the destination path for the file that contains
the uncompressed data.
<P>
You cannot use /C when the<I> headerpath</I> is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The path and file-name information stored in the header of
the file that contains the compressed data can be displayed by using the
/SHOW option available with UNPACK. For information about the /SHOW option,
see the UNPACK command in the online<I> OS/2 Command Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
