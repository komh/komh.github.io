<H1>Prepare for Debugging (/C)</H1><!-- entering slot 158 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>  /C[ODEVIEW]
<P>
This option works exactly like the <A HREF="154_L4_PrepareforDebuggingD.html">Prepare
for Debugging (/DE)</A> option.
<P>
The /C option is used to prepare for debugging with any debugger. With this
option, LINK386 imbeds symbolic data and line number information in the
executable output file.
<P>
You can run this executable file outside Debug; the debugging information
in the file is ignored.  However, to reduce executable file size, use this
option only for debugging.  Then you can link a separate version without
the /C option after the program is debugged.
