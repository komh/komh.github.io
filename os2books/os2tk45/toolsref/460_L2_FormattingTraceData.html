<H1>Formatting Trace Data</H1><!-- entering slot 476 -->
<P>
This section gives a brief description of the formatting process as an aid
to generating correct formatting strings.
<P>
Each trace record stored in the RAS buffer consists of a header followed
by a number of variable length trace data records. The header identifies
the major and minor code, time stamp, process ID, etc., and the total length
of the trace data for that trace record.
<P>
Each MEM32, MEM, ASCIIZ32, or ASCIIZ data statement, coded in the trace
source file for a tracepoint, produces an associated data record to be stored
in the trace buffer. The data records consist of a 3-byte prefix followed
by the trace data. This prefix consists of a status byte followed by the
length of the data for that statement. The status byte indicates whether
valid data has been traced.
<P>
Dynamic trace can only trace data that is resident in memory at the time
that the tracepoint is executed. Data may not be able to be traced for two
reasons:  it resides in a page that is currently paged out or the address
specified is invalid. This latter case usually occurs due to tracing indirectly
via invalid pointer variables. In either of these two cases dynamic trace
sets the status byte accordingly and stores the pointer in the place of
the wanted data. No more data is attempted to be traced for this invocation
of the tracepoint, but tracing will resume the next time this tracepoint
is encountered.
<P>
Since the position of these prefix bytes, within a trace record, is dependent
on the data being traced and the number of MEM32, MEM, ASCIIZ32, or ASCIIZ
statements, the Trace Formatter must be told when to expect the prefix in
the trace record. This is the purpose of the<B> %P</B> formatting control.
It must be coded in the formatting string at every place a data record is
expected.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> With ASCIIZ and ASCIIZ32 commands, the prefix must be used
to obtain the length of the string since the string is not null terminated.
