<H1>LIBRARY Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B> LIBRARY [libraryname][initialization]  [termination]
<P>
This statement identifies the executable file as a dynamic-link library
and optionally defines the name and library module initialization required.

<P>
If &lt;libraryname&gt; is given, it becomes the name of the library as it
is known by OS/2. This name can be any valid file name. If &lt;libraryname&gt;
is not given, the name of the executable file - with the extension removed
- becomes the name of the library.
<P>
If &lt;initialization&gt; is given, it defines the library initialization
required and can be one of the values below. If omitted, &lt;initialization&gt;
defaults to INITGLOBAL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
INITGLOBAL<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The library initialization routine is
called only when the library module is initially loaded into memory.
<P>
Using this keyword without a termination flag implies TERMGLOBAL for DLLs
with 32-bit entry points.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> INITINSTANCE<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The
library initialization routine is called each time a new process gains access
to the library.
<P>
Using this keyword without a termination flag implies TERMINSTANCE for DLLs
with 32-bit entry points.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If &lt;termination&gt; is given, it defines the library termination required
and can be one of the values below. If omitted, &lt;initialization&gt; defaults
to TERMGLOBAL. The termination flag can only apply to DLLs with 32-bit entry
points.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
TERMGLOBAL<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The library termination routine is called
only when the library module is unloaded from memory.
<P>
Using this keyword without an initialization flag implies INITGLOBAL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TERMINSTANCE
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>The library termination routine is called each time
a process relinquishes access to the library.
<P>
Using this keyword without an initialization flag implies INITINSTANCE.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the LIBRARY statement is included in a module definition file, the NAME
statement cannot appear. If no LIBRARY statement appears, the module definition
file describes an application.
<P>
The following example assigns the name<I> calendar</I> to the dynamic-link
library and specifies that library initialization be performed each time
a new process gains access.
<PRE>  LIBRARY calendar INITINSTANCE</PRE>
