<P>
MKTMPF creates template repository files from text input files.
<P>
A template repository (also referred to as a<I> repository file</I> or<I> repository
</I>in this document) is a binary file used by the operating system's Error
Logging Facility to find error descriptions, causes, and actions in various
message files.
<P>
The first step in creating a repository file is to create a text input file
for MKTMPF using any text editor. The contents and format of these files
are described later in this document.  These input files can have any file
name that is valid for your file system. A standard extension, TMP, is recommended,
but not required.
<P>
MKTMPF reads and validates this file, reporting any errors or warnings,
before translating it to binary data and creating a repository file.
