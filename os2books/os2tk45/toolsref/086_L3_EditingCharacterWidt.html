<H1>Editing Character Width</H1><!-- entering slot 90 -->
<P>
The<B> Width</B> and<B> Shift</B> menus allow you to change the width of
individual characters.

<P>
The<B> Width</B> Menu
<P>
Use the<B> Width</B> menu to alter the width of a single character. This
menu is enabled only when you are editing a proportional space font. You
can make a character wider or narrower by adding or deleting columns of
pels from the right, the left, or both sides. You may also use the<B> Set
Character Increment</B> option to set the width of a character. On-line
help panels describe how to perform these functions.
<BR>

<P>
The<B> Shift</B> Menu
<P>
Use the<B> Shift</B> menu to insert a one-pel-wide row or column into (or
delete from) the character that you are editing. When you select shift,
the pointer becomes a flat horizontal or vertical bar when inside the edit
window.  This enables you to position it exactly where you want the operation
to take place.
<P>
To cancel a shift you have selected before execution, select<B> Cancel Choice</B>.
