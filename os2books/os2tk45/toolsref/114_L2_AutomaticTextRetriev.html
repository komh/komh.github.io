<P>
The KwikINF window includes a<B> Search String</B> entry field. You can
specify the text string you want KwikINF to search for. Or, under certain
conditions, this entry field automatically contains the word located under
the cursor when you press your KwikINF hot key. This text retrieval feature
is available from OS/2 full-screen and Presentation Manager (PM) multi-line
entry (MLE) fields. This feature is also available from PM AVIO and VIO
windows. Communication Manager's 3270 emulator is a common example of a
PM AVIO window. An OS/2 Window is a VIO window. This means that if, for
example, you open an OS/2 Window and start an OS/2 text-based application,
KwikINF will automatically retrieve the word under the cursor when you press
your KwikINF hot key. This automatic text-retrieval feature is not available
from graphic-text PM windows.
