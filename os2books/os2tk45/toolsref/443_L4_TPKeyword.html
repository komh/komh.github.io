<H1>TP Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 457 -->
<P>
The TP parameter is a required keyword parameter. If TP is specified more
than once for a single tracepoint definition, the tracepoint is discarded.
TP has three mutually exclusive definitions which can be coded as:
<PRE>        TP=@STATIC,
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
STATIC<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> defines this tracepoint entry to be used
only for creating a trace format statement for the TFF file.  No tracepoint
definition is created for the TDF, and the only other TRACE parameters that
will be used are DESC, MINOR and FMT. This is used to create trace formatting
information for static tracepoints. If the TSF contains only @STATIC directives,
no TDF files are created.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>        TP=@filename,linenum,</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
filename<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> is an ASCII string specifying the name
(including extension) of a source filename used in creating the module.
 The source filename is stored in the debug information contained in the
executable module, so debug information must exist to use this parameter.
The filename is not case sensitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> linenum<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> is
a decimal number specifying the line number in the given source file name
to place the tracepoint.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Debug information must exist to use this option. The statement
at the given source linenum may have been rearranged during compiler optimization,
so the developer must use this with caution.  If the linenum is not found
in the debug information, the tracepoint is applied at the next linenum
defined in the debug information and a warning message is issued to the
user.
<P>
An example to apply a tracepoint to line 35 of file stubfile.c is:
<PRE>    TRACE   MINOR=0x700A,              /* puts tracepoint on code at line */            TP=@stubfile.c,35,.....    /*  35 of source file stubfile.c   */
</PRE>

<PRE>        TP=.name[{+|-}offs][,RETEP],
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
name<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> is a public label or an entry point name of
a procedure to be traced. The "." preceding<B> name</B> is required.<B> Name
</B>must be found in the debug information in the module or<B> name</B> must
be a public symbol as found in the MAP file. If debug information is used,
the address of this tracepoint will be immediately following the prologue
of the procedure. If MAP information is used, this address points to the
opcode at the given label.
<P>
If the procedure was compiled with debug support,<B> Name</B> is case sensitive.
 If not, C language functions will be case sensitive and begin with an underscore
"_" character unless the function is declared with the Pascal calling convention,
in which case the underscore is omitted and the name is capitalized.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> offs
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>(optional) is a decimal (specified as nnnnnnnn)
or hex (specified as 0xnnnnnnnn) offset from the entry point address.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> RETEP
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>(optional) specifies that the tracepoint will be
inserted at the<B> return</B> address corresponding to this entry point.
This is just before the procedure epilogue is executed and at this point
the procedure's automatic data is still addressable from register (E)BP
and the return code (if any) is set up in (E)AX.
<P>
The module must include information supplied by the debug compile option
(see <A HREF="432_L2_SymbolicDebugSupport.html">Symbolic Debug Support</A>),
meaning that the source language must have been C, otherwise an error message
will be generated and this tracepoint discarded.
<P>
When the RETEP is used, the<B> name</B> must be a valid entry point to a
procedure.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The RETEP option depends upon the manner in which a C compiler
generates its code. Therefore this option may not work will some of the
new compilers.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For ASM functions to accomplish tracing, a label must be made
public to have a tracepoint applied.  Therefore, to accomplish "POST" tracing,
a label must be made public at the return statement.
<P>
The following are partial examples of<!-- entering slot 458 --> Pre/Post
tracing of DosOpen:
<PRE>      TRACE   MINOR=0x0001,              TP=.DosOpen,.....            /* Pre-invocation tracing */

      TRACE   MINOR=0x8001,
              TP=.DosOpen,RETEP,.....      /* Post-invocation tracing */
</PRE>

<P>
It is not possible to set dynamic tracepoints on the following machine instructions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
0x9C<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> PUSHF<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xCC<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> INT 3<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xCD<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> INT n<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xCE<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> INTO<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0x62<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> BOUND<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0x69<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> IMUL<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0x6B<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> IMUL<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xF6<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> DIV, IDIV, MUL, IMUL, NEG, NOT, TEST (immediate)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>0xF7<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL> DIV, IDIV, MUL, IMUL, NEG, NOT, TEST (immediate)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
TRCUST gives an error for these opcodes and the tracepoint is rejected.

<P>
In all cases, two tracepoints cannot be applied at the same address.
