<H1>OS/2 Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 185 -->
<P>
In most respects, linking a program for OS/2 is similar to linking a program
for DOS. The principal difference is that most programs created for DOS
run as stand-alone applications, whereas programs for OS/2 generally call
one or more<I> dynamic-link libraries.</I> See <A HREF="181_L4_WhatIsaDynamicLinkLi.html">What
Is a Dynamic-Link Library?</A> and <A HREF="182_L4_AdvantagesofDynamicL.html">Advantages
of Dynamic Linking</A>.
<P>
<B>Import and Export Definitions</B>
<P>
Each dynamic-link library (.DLL file) defines<I> export definitions</I> that
tell OS/2 what functions the library has. Functions not exported can only
be called from within the library. Each export definition specifies a function
name.
<P>
Conversely, each executable program (.EXE file) defines<I> import definitions
</I>that tell OS/2 which dynamic-link functions the program needs and where
they can be found. Otherwise, OS/2 would not know which dynamic-link libraries
to load when the program is run. Each import definition specifies a function
name and the .DLL file where the function resides.
<P>
<B>Methods of OS/2 Linking</B>
<P>
There are two methods of OS/2 Linking:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Linking without an Import Library<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Linking with an Import Library<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Linking with an import library requires more steps but has certain advantages.
