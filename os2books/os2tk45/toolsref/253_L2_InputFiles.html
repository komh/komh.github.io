<P>
The input file used by MKTMPF to create repository files can be created
with a text editor (or other method of the user's choosing). It should contain
one set of default path names and a set of one or more template entries.
The following is an example of an input file with a single template.

The keywords surrounded by &lt;&gt; are replaced by the appropriate data.

Blank lines are ignored.

Any line in which an asterisk appears before any other non-white space is
ignored.
<P>
Keywords are not case-sensitive; key values are case-sensitive.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Long file names, white space, and special characters are acceptable
if the user's file system supports them. If a path name contains leading
or trailing white space, it should be enclosed in double quotation marks.
You can provide either a full path name or just the file name. If the file
name is provided, it is the developer's responsibility to make sure it is
in a directory specified in the DPATH of the system where the repository
will be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
