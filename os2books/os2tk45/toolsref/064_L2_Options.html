<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Option characters are not case sensitive: /R and /r
are equivalent.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Options can be shortened to the fewest characters
that uniquely identify them.  The characters in brackets can be omitted:
/N and /NOLOGO are equivalent.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Although use of the minimum one-letter abbreviations
is allowed, if a future release has an additional option starting with the
same letter, the one-letter option will no longer be usable.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The option /STACK is deprecated, and has been replaced
by /STACKDOS and /STACKOS2. Because /STACK has serious limitations and can
potentially damage an executable file, it is strongly recommended that you
do not use it. Use one or both of the replacement options instead.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
