<H1>MEM Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 469 -->
<P>
This is used to log memory in a function compiled using 16-bit segment:offset
addressing and is coded as:
<PRE>        MEM=(address_spec,flag,{length|LEN}),
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a segmented memory address specification
as described in <A HREF="456_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address Specification</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>flag<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a mandatory parameter
that identifies the level of indirection to be used on the address. The
<I>flag</I> may be one of the following:
<PRE>D[IRECT]
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...
IF
</PRE>

<P>
DIRECT implies that the address specifies a memory location to be saved
in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address contains a segmented address and is dereferenced
to obtain the memory location. The optional asterisks denote the level of
indirection, one for each level. The indirect offsets iiiiiiii are added
to or subtracted from the value found at the given level of indirection.

<P>
IF (Indirect Flat) means that the address contains a flat address that is
dereferenced to obtain the memory location.
<P>
Only far pointers may be dereferenced when using segmented addressing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> length
<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL>is the number of bytes at the memory location to
be saved in the trace buffer. If<I> length</I> is too big, a warning message
will be given, and<I> length</I> will be set to MAXDATALENGTH. If<I> length
</I>is 0 an error message will be given, and this tracepoint will be ignored.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>LEN<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> specifies that this
is a variable length record to log and the length was specified by the preceding
LEN statement. If there was no preceding LEN statement, this tracepoint
is rejected. Either length or LEN must be specified, but not both.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
