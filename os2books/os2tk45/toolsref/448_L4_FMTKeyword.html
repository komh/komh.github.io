<H1>FMT Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 463 -->
<P>
The optional FMT parameter is used to produce the formatting string for
the trace data. The developer should use these to control formatting the
output produced by the Trace Formatter.  Each<B> FMT</B> keyword causes
CR/LF to be appended to the format string. The formatting string is similar
to a C library printf string specification. It consists of ASCII characters
and formatting controls enclosed in double quotes as for a C language string.
Each formatting primitive describes the format of the data in the trace
buffer at the formatting position and must match the data stored in the
trace buffer by the data statements described later. See <A HREF="460_L2_FormattingTraceData.html">Formatting
Trace Data</A> for a description of how the data is stored in the trace
buffer and subsequently formatted.
<P>
The formatting controls are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Innn<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Ignore nnn number of bytes in the trace
buffer.
<P>
This tells the Trace Formatter to skip over the next nnn bytes in the current
trace record. This could be used, for example, to skip over unimportant
data, traced as a block, and only output the data of interest.
<P>
When using this control, nnn represents an ASCII decimal number and must
be followed by a space.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "ignore ten bytes %I10 here",
                   FMT = "       and two more %I2 here",

        generates: ignore ten bytes here
                          and two more here

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%P<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Process the data prefix
bytes associated with the trace data.
<P>
This tells the Trace Formatter that the next bytes in the trace record are
the prefix or header bytes for data logged by the dynamic tracing mechanism.
This is required to precede any format control describing data logged from
memory.  Do not use this before data that was logged from a register and
never use with static tracepoints. See <A HREF="460_L2_FormattingTraceData.html">Formatting
Trace Data</A> for a description of how the data is stored in the trace
buffer and the use of this control.
<PRE>        statements: FMT="memory byte = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69B",

        generates:  memory byte = C2

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%B<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a byte of data.

<PRE>        statement: FMT = "memory byte = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69B"

        generates: memory byte = 01

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%W<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a word of data.

<PRE>        statement: FMT = "register word = %W"

        generates: register word = 0001


        statement: FMT = "memory word = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69W"

        generates: memory word = 0001

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%D<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a double word
of data.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "double word EAX = %D"

        generates: double word EAX = 0000 4B2C


        statement: FMT = "double memory word = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69D"

        generates: double memory word = 0000 4B2C

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%F<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a Flat (0:32 bit)
address.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "flat address EAX = %F"

        generates: flat address EAX = 00004B2C

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%Q<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a quad word of
data.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "quad word from regs EAX and EBX = %Q"

        generates: quad word from regs EAX and EBX = 00004B2C 00000001

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%A<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output a segmented (16:16
bit) address.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "segmented address in SS:SP = %A"

        generates: segmented address in SS:SP = 00B7:0001


        statement: FMT = "segmented address in memory = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69A"

        generates: segmented address in memory = 00B7:0001

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%R<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Repeat the following
format control for the rest of the memory that was logged.
<P>
This is used for formatting variable length records.  Use this in place
of the prefix parameter %P to log the rest of the record in the format specified
following the repeat code.
<PRE>   statement: FMT = "log a variable number of words from memory = 1W"

   generates: log a variable number of words from memory = 0001 0004

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%S<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output an ASCIIZ string.

<P>
The prefix formatting control should always precede this for dynamic tracepoints
because the data was logged from memory.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the tracepoint is static, then<B> %P</B> should not be
used because the string is terminated with a null byte.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "string = /usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69S"

        generates: string = c:\os2\os2.ini

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%U<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Format the remainder
of the trace record as a sequence of bytes.
<P>
This will output the remaining of the traced data, including any prefix
bytes.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "garbage = %U"

        generates: garbage = 00 00 00 03 c2 c1 c4 ff 04 00 09 c0 18

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%X<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output the major event
code.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "major code = %X"

        generates: major code = <!-- entering slot 464 -->00C2

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>%Y<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> Output the minor event
code.
<PRE>        statement: FMT = "minor code = %Y"

        generates: minor code = 0081

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To avoid conflicts with source file control information, all formatting
specifications can be in upper or lower case. Also, prefix format specifications
may be combined with data format specifications. For example, the following
create the same format controls in the TFF:
<PRE>        FMT = "/usr/cmvc/family/pubdoc/vc/0/1/2/2/s.69W here"        FMT = "%p%w here"
        FMT = " %P %W here"
