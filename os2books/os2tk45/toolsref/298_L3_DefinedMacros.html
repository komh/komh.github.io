<P>
After you have defined a macro, you can use it anywhere in your description
file with the following syntax:
<PRE>$(macroname)
</PRE>

<P>
The parentheses are not required if the macro name is only one character
long.  To use a dollar sign ( $ ) without using a macro, enter two dollar
signs ( $$ ), or use the caret ( ^ ) before the dollar sign as an escape
character.
<P>
When NMAKE runs, it replaces all occurrences of<I> $(macroname)</I> with
the defined macro string. If the macro is undefined, nothing is substituted.
After a macro is defined, you can cancel it only with the !UNDEF directive.
