<H1>Optimize Far Calls (/F)</H1><!-- entering slot 162 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>  /F[ARCALLTRANSLATION]
<P>
This option causes LINK386 to optimize far-call instructions made from one
segment to a target address in the same segment. LINK386 replaces calling
sequences such as CALL FAR function with the following:
<PRE>PUSH     CS
CALL     NEAR function
NOP
</PRE>

<P>
The new calling sequence is significantly faster when running in protected
mode.  Also, a load-time relocation is eliminated, which decreases program
file size and speeds program loading.
<P>
In general, the greatest benefit occurs if you use the "Combine Contiguous
Code(/PACKC)" in addition to the /F option.
<P>
The /F option has no effect on programs that make only near calls.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> There is a small risk involved with using the /F option. LINK386
may mistakenly interpret a byte of immediate data in a code segment as a
far call if it has to have the far-call opcode (0x9A).
