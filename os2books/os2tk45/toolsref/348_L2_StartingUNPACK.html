<H1>Starting UNPACK</H1><!-- entering slot 358 -->
<P>
UNPACK restores a file of compressed data to its original size and copies
it to a specified drive and path. To start the UNPACK command, type:
<PRE>  UNPACK sourcefile
  [destinationdrive:] [destinationpath]
  [/SHOW] [/N:singlefile]
  [/V] [/F]
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
sourcefile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies the name of an existing file
that contains compressed data.  If this file contains one or more files
of compressed data, UNPACK restores each file within the file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> destinationdrive:
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Specifies the name of the drive where you want
UNPACK to copy one or more restored files.
<P>
When you specify a destination drive but not a path, UNPACK uses the path
information stored in the header of the file that contains the compressed
data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> destinationpath<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies
the name of the directory (and its subdirectories) where you want UNPACK
to copy one or more restored files.
<P>
When specified, the destination path overrides the path information stored
in the header of the file that contains the compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /SHOW
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Displays the destination path and file-name information
that are saved in the header of each file containing compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /N:singlefile
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Extracts and uncompresses one file from a file
that contains multiple files of compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /V
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Verifies that sectors written to the target disk
are recorded correctly.  This parameter lets you know that critical data
has been correctly recorded.
<P>
This parameter causes UNPACK to run slower, because a check is made for
each entry recorded on the disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /F<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies
that files with extended attributes should not be unpacked or copied if
the destination file system does not support extended attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
