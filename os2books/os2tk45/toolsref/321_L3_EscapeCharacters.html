<P>
NMAKE uses the following punctuation characters in its syntax:
<PRE>┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│(     │)     │#     │$     │^     │\     │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│{     │}     │!     │@     │-     │      │
└──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
</PRE>

<P>
To use one of these characters in a command and not have it interpreted
by NMAKE, use a caret ( ^ ) in front of the character.
<P>
For example,
<PRE>BIG^#.C
</PRE>

<P>
is treated as
<PRE>BIG#.C
</PRE>

<P>
With the caret, you can include a literal newline character in a description
file.  This capability is useful in macro definitions, as in the following
example:
<PRE>XYZ=abc^&lt;ENTER&gt;
def
</PRE>

<P>
The effect is equivalent to assigning the C-style string "abc\ndef" to the
XYZ macro.  Note that this effect differs from the effect of using the backslash
( \ ) to continue a line. A newline character that follows a backslash is
replaced with a space.
<P>
NMAKE ignores a caret that is not followed by any of the characters it uses
in its syntax.  A caret that appears within quotation marks is not treated
as an escape character.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The escape character cannot be used in the command portion
of a dependency block.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
