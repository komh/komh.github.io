<PRE>TRIG.LIB : SIN.OBJ COS.OBJ ARCTAN.OBJ
  !LIB TRIG.LIB -+$?;
</PRE>

<P>
In the example above, the macro $? represents the names of all dependent
files that are out-of-date with respect to the target file.  The exclamation
point ( ! ) preceding the LIB command causes NMAKE to execute the LIB command
once for each dependent file in the list.  As a result of this description,
the LIB command is executed up to three times, each time replacing a module
with a newer version.
<PRE>DIR=C:\INCLUDE
$(DIR)\GLOBALS.H : GLOBALS.H
 COPY GLOBALS.H $@
$(DIR)\TYPES.H : TYPES.H
 COPY TYPES.H $@
$(DIR)\MACROS.H : MACROS.H
 COPY MACROS.H $@
</PRE>

<P>
The example above shows how to update a group of include files. Each of
the files GLOBALS.H, TYPES.H, and MACROS.H in the directory C:\INCLUDE depends
on its counterpart in the current directory.  If one of the include files
is out-of-date, NMAKE replaces it with the file of the same name from the
current directory.
<P>
The following description file, which uses the special macro $$@, is equivalent:

<PRE>DIR=C:\INCLUDE
$(DIR)\GLOBALS.H $(DIR)\TYPES.H $(DIR)\MACROS.H : $$(@F)
!COPY $? $@
</PRE>

<P>
The special macro $$(@F) signifies the file name (without the path) of the
current target.
<P>
When NMAKE evaluates the description block, it evaluates the three targets,
one at a time, with respect to their dependents.  Thus, NMAKE first checks
whether C:\INCLUDE\GLOBALS.H is out-of-date compared with GLOBALS.H in the
current directory.  If so, it executes the command to copy the dependent
file GLOBALS.H to the target.  NMAKE repeats the procedure for the other
two targets.
<P>
Note that on the command line, the macro $? refers to the dependent for
this target.  The macro $@ specifies the full file specification of the
target file.
