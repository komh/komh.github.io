<H1>Link for Object and Library Files (LINK386)</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->
<P>
LINK386 is used to combine object files and standard library files into
a single file: an executable file, a dynamic-link library, or a device driver.
The output file from LINK386 is not constrained to specific memory addresses.
Thus, the operating system can load and execute this file at any convenient
address.
<P>
<B>LINK386 Input</B>
<P>
LINK386 uses the following files as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One or more object files that are linked with any
optional library files to form the executable file. Object files usually
have a .OBJ extension.
<P>
LINK386 accepts object files compiled or assembled for 8088, 80286, 80386,
80486, or PENTIUM* microprocessors. Object files must be in the Object Module
Format (OMF), which is based on the Intel* 8086 OMF, and Tool Interface
Standards Portable Formats Specification.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One or more library files.  The library files contain
object modules that are linked to the object files to form the executable
file. Library files usually have a .LIB extension.
<P>
Library files are used to resolve external references in your object files.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A module definition file.  The module definition file
provides information to LINK386 about the executable file or dynamic link
library file it is creating.  The module definition file usually has a .DEF
extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>LINK386 Output</B>
<P>
LINK386 can produce dynamic-link libraries (.DLL) and device drivers (.SYS),
in addition to executable files (.EXE). For additional information, see
<A HREF="133_L3_OutputFiles.html">Output Files</A>.
<P>
LINK386 displays all of its output messages on the standard output device.

<P>
<B>LINK386 Features</B>
<P>
LINK386 creates the executable file and map file in the current directory
unless you enter an explicit path.
<P>
LINK386 looks in several locations for object, library, and module-definition
files. See <A HREF="140_L4_WhereLINK386Looksfor.html">Where LINK386 Looks
for Files</A>.
<P>
File names are not case sensitive; for example, abc.exe and ABC.EXE refer
to the same file.
<P>
If you enter a file name without an extension, LINK386 adds a <A HREF="143_L4_DefaultFilenameExten.html">Default
Filename Extension</A> that depends on the type of file expected.
<P>
If you leave a field blank (but define the field with a comma), LINK386
uses a default for the field.  If you end the LINK386 command with a semicolon
(;), LINK386 uses <A HREF="142_L4_FilenameDefaults.html">Filename Defaults
</A>for all remaining fields.
<P>
If you do not give all file names or do not end the command line with a
semicolon, LINK386 prompts you for the omitted files.
