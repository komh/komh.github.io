<B>Syntax:</B>  .PRECIOUS : targets...
<P>
This pseudotarget tells NMAKE not to delete a target even if the commands
that build it are terminated or interrupted. This pseudotarget overrides
the NMAKE default.  By default, NMAKE deletes the target if it cannot be
sure that the target was built successfully.
<P>
For example,
<PRE>.PRECIOUS : TOOLS.LIB
TOOLS.LIB : A2Z.OBJ Z2A.OBJ
 command
  :
</PRE>

<P>
If the commands to build TOOLS.LIB are interrupted, leaving an incomplete
file, NMAKE does not delete the partially built TOOLS.LIB.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The pseudotarget .PRECIOUS is useful only in limited circumstances.
 Most professional development tools have their own interrupt handlers and
"clean up" when errors occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
