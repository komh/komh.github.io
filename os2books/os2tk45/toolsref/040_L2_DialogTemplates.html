<H1>Dialog Templates</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
The Dialog Editor creates an ASCII text file that has the file-name extension
.DLG. The compiled form of this file, created using the Resource Compiler,
has the file-name extension .RES.
<P>
The .DLG file contains a series of statements, collectively termed a<I> dialog
template</I>, that define each dialog box and each control in each dialog
box. The statement for each dialog box contains the data required to create
it, namely its class, size, position, window text, and any other special
information required for the window.
<P>
Normally, the template consists of a dialog box window followed by the controls
contained within it, which are child windows.
<P>
The first statement in the template is the DLGINCLUDE statement, which specifies
the file name of the include file.
<P>
The next statement is the DLGTEMPLATE statement, which specifies the symbolic
identifier of the dialog box (MYDIALOG). The DLGTEMPLATE statement also
specifies any loading and memory options. The actual dialog template is
contained within the first BEGIN and last END statement. There is a CONTROL
statement for each of the controls in the dialog box. The CONTROL statement
is a general statement that is followed by parameters that further specify
the control, such as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Text, where appropriate.  For example, the text<B> OK
</B>is defined for one of the push buttons.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Application-defined symbolic or integer identifiers
for each control.  Your application uses the identifier to track the responses
from controls.  For example, ID_NULL is the identifier of the text control.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The types and positions of the various controls.  For
example, the group box control is a control window of window class WC_STATIC.
The<B> Cancel</B> and<B> Help</B> push buttons are of window class WC_BUTTON.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The appearance and operation of the dialog box and
its controls, which are specified in detail by combinations of style parameters.
For example, the check boxes have a class style of BS_CHECKBOX, and radio
buttons have a class style of BS_RADIOBUTTON.  You can also specify appropriate
WS_* styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If necessary, you can use a text editor to edit the .DLG file, for example,
to<I> fine-tune</I> the dialog template produced by the dialog box editor.
 You can even use a text editor to produce your own .DLG file. The Dialog
Editor uses the general CONTROL statement with window classes and control
styles to define controls.
<P>
You can use the CONTROL statement in the same way to define your controls,
or you can use any of several predefined control statements that give you
the same result.  For example, the predefined control statement PUSHBUTTON
gives you a WC_BUTTON class window with default styles of BS_PUSHBUTTON
and WS_TABSTOP.
<P>
The predefined controls are described in the following sections.
