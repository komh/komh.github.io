<B>Syntax:</B> BASE:n
<P>
Where n is a value rounded up to the nearest multiple of 64K Indicates that
each object of the module has a preferred load address starting with object
1 at this address, object 2 at the next available multiple of 64K, and so
on. Internal relocation records are then applied using this addressing scheme.

<P>
If the module's objects can be loaded beginning at this preferred address,
then no load-time internal relocation records need be applied.
<P>
If the module's objects cannot be loaded beginning at this preferred address,
then the internal relocation records that have been retained in the file
data will be applied.
<P>
.EXE files may specify a base address, but it must be 64K.  If it isn't,
a warning will be issued and a base address of 64K will be used anyway.
This option provides the same support as the BASE module definition file
statement.
