<P>
The<B> MLE</B> statement creates a multiple-line entry-field control.  The
control is a rectangle in which the user can type and edit multiple lines
of text.  The control displays a pointer when the user selects it.  The
user can then use the keyboard to enter text or edit the existing text.
 Editing keys include the Backspace and Delete keys. By using the mouse
or the direction-arrow keys, the user can select the character or characters
to delete or select the place to insert new characters.  The<B> MLE</B> statement,
which you can use only in a<B> DIALOG</B> or<B> WINDOW</B> statement, defines
the text, identifier, coordinates, dimensions, and attributes of a control
window.  The predefined class for this control is WC_MLE.  If you do not
specify a style, the default style is MLS_BORDER, WS_GROUP, and WS_TABSTOP.
If the MLS_READONLY style is not specified, the user can edit the text.
