The WINDOW statement creates a window of the specified class.  The statement
defines the position and dimensions of the window relative to its parent
window, as well as the window-box style.  The WINDOW statement is typically
used in a WINDOWTEMPLATE or FRAME statement.
<P>
Typically, only one WINDOW statement is used in a FRAME statement.  It defines
the client window belonging to the corresponding frame window. The optional
BEGIN and END keywords enclose any CONTROL statements that are given with
the window.  CONTROL statements given in this manner represent child windows
belonging to the window created by the WINDOW statement.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
