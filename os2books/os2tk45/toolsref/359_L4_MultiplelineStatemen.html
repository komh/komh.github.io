<P>
Multiple-line statements consist of a keyword identifying the resource type,
a number or character string which specifies the resource identifier, and,
between the BEGIN and END keywords, additional resource statements that
define the resource data.  For example, this MENU statement defines a menu
resource:
<PRE>    MENU 1
    BEGIN
        MENUITEM "Alpha", 101
        MENUITEM "Beta",  102
    END
</PRE>

<P>
The menu identifier is 1.  The menu contains two MENUITEM statements that
define the contents of the menu.  In multiple-line statements such as DLGTEMPLATE
and WINDOWTEMPLATE, RC allows any level of nested statements. For example,
the DLGTEMPLATE and WINDOWTEMPLATE statements typically contain a single
DIALOG or FRAME statement.  These statements can contain any number of WINDOW
and CONTROL statements; the WINDOW and CONTROL statements can contain additional
WINDOW and CONTROL statements; and so on.  The nested statements let you
define controls and other child windows for the dialog boxes and windows.
 If a nested statement creates a child window or control, the parent and
owner of the new window is the window created by the containing statement.
 (FRAME statements occasionally create frame controls whose parent and owner
windows are not the same.)
