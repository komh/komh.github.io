<H1>What Is a Dynamic-Link Library?</H1><!-- entering slot 186 -->
<P>
A dynamic-link library contains executable code for common functions, just
as an ordinary library does.  Yet code for functions in dynamic-link libraries
is not copied into the executable (.EXE) file.  Instead, the library itself
is loaded into memory at run time, along with the .EXE file.
