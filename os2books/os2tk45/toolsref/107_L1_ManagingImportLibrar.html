<H1>Managing Import Libraries (IMPLIB)</H1><!-- entering slot 112 -->
<P>
IMPLIB creates import libraries used to link dynamic-link libraries with
applications.
<P>
Import libraries are created by IMPLIB and used to link dynamic-link libraries
with applications.
<P>
<B>What Are Import Libraries?</B>
<P>
Import libraries are similar in some respects to standard libraries:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You specify import libraries and standard libraries
in the same command line field of LINK386 (see <A HREF="129_L1_LinkforObjectandLibr.html">Link
for Object and Library Files (LINK386)</A> for information on LINK386) or
OS/2 16-bit LINK.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Both kinds of libraries resolve external references
at link time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
However, import libraries differ from standard libraries in that they contain
no executable code. Rather, they identify the dynamic-link libraries where
the executable code can be found at run time.
<P>
<B>Why Use Import Libraries?</B>
<P>
Creating import libraries is an extra step. Nevertheless, import libraries
are recommended for use with all dynamic-link libraries for two reasons:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->IMPLIB automates much of the program creation process
for you.  To use IMPLIB, supply it with the .DEF file you already created
for the dynamic-link library.  Without an import library, you must create
a second .DEF file that explicitly defines all needed functions in the dynamic-link
library.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Import libraries make it easier for one person to
write a library and another to write the application. Much of the linking
process (linking the .DLL file and creating the import library) can be done
by the author of the dynamic-link library. The import library and associated
.DLL file can then be given as a unit to the person linking the application
- that person need not worry about creating a .DEF file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
