<H1>Running PACK With Individual Files</H1><!-- entering slot 355 -->
<P>
You can start PACK with a single command from the command line. You can
type the names of all the files you want to compress directly on the command
line. Include the drive and path if the files are not in the working directory.
You can specify file names with any combination of uppercase and lowercase
letters. File-name extensions are not required; however, if you specify
a file name that has an extension, also type the extension.
<P>
The command-syntax is as follows:
<PRE>  PACK sourcefile [packedfile]
    [/H:headerpath\
    |/H:headerfile
    |/H:headerpath\ headerfile]
    [/D:headerdate]
    [/T:headertime]
    [/C] [/A] [/R]
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
sourcefile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies the name of the file you want
packed (compressed). This parameter is required. Include the drive and path
if the file is not in the working directory. Global file-name characters
are permitted.
<P>
When the data is compressed, the name of the source file is placed in the
header of the compressed file and is used as the destination file name during
unpacking.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> packedfile<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Specifies
the name of the file that will contain the compressed data.  Files that
contain compressed data can be recognized by the @ symbol as the last character
in the file name.  If you do not specify this parameter, PACK places the
compressed data in<I> sourcefile</I> and modifies its name to contain the
@ symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /H:headerpath\ or /H:headerfile or /H:headerpath\headerfile
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>These parameters can be used separately or they
can be paired.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<P>
<LI>H:headerpath\<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL> Specifies the destination path
to be placed in the header of the file that contains the compressed data.
Drive letters are not permitted. Unless this path is overridden with the
UNPACK command, it will be the destination path when the file is uncompressed.
<I>headerpath</I> must end with a back slash (\).<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> /H:headerfile
<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL>Specifies the name of the file to be placed in
the header of the compressed file. This file name will be used as the destination
file for the uncompressed data and cannot be overridden.
<P>
If a header file name is not specified, PACK automatically uses<I> sourcefile
</I>as the name of the file that is placed in the header of the compressed
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> /H:headerpath\headerfile<!-- lm: 0x11 31 -->
<UL> Specifies
that both a destination path and a destination file name are to be placed
in the header of the file that has the compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 21 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /D:headerdate
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Records the date in the header of the file that
has the compressed data, and also in the destination file when it is uncompressed.

<P>
The date must follow the format /D:MM-DD-YYYY (for example: /D:08-20-1991
and /D:12-30-2010)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /T:headertime<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Records
the time in the header of the file that has the compressed data, and also
in the destination file when it is uncompressed.
<P>
The time must follow the format /T:HH.MM (for example /T:02.06 and /T:14.54).
Hour 00 represents 12 a.m. and hour 12 represents 12 p.m.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /C
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Specifies that the current path be placed in the
header of the file that contains the compressed data. When the UNPACK command
is used, this path will be the destination path for the file that contains
the uncompressed data.
<P>
You cannot use /C when the<I> headerpath</I> is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /A
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Adds data from<I> sourcefile</I> to the data in
<I>packedfile</I>.
<P>
The source file can be either in a compressed or uncompressed state. If
the source file is in an uncompressed state, the data is compressed before
being added to the file containing the compressed data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> /R
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>Removes the file specified by<I> sourcefile</I> from
the file that contains only compressed data. The<I> sourcefile</I> parameter
must specify the path and file name exactly as they appear in the header
of the file with the compressed data; otherwise, the following error message
appears on the screen.
<PRE>The specified file to remove was not found.
</PRE>

<P>
The /R parameter is valid only when used in conjunction with<I> sourcefile
</I>and<I> packedfile</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> To display the path and file-name information stored in the
header of the file that contains the compressed data, use the UNPACK command
and specify the SHOW option. For information about the SHOW option, see
the UNPACK command in the online<I> OS/2 Command Reference</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
You can also get end-to-end compressed data by using global file-name characters.
For example:
<PRE>  PACK *.EXE BUNDLE</PRE>
