The NOTEBOOK statement creates a notebook control within the dialog window.
 This control is used to organize information on individual pages so that
it can be located and displayed easily. The NOTEBOOK statement defines the
identifier, position, dimensions, and attributes of a notebook control.
The predefined class for this control is WC_NOTEBOOK. If you do not specify
a style, the default style is WS_TABSTOP and WS_VISIBLE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example creates a notebook control at position (20, 20) within the
dialog window.  The notebook has a width of 200 character units and a height
of 50 character units.  Its resource identifier is 201. The tabs style BKS_ROUNDEDTABS
specification overrides the notebook default style of square tabs. The default
styles WS_TABSTOP and WS_GROUP are both in effect, though only the latter
is specified.
