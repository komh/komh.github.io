This statement identifies the executable file as an application and optionally
defines the name and type.

If &lt;appname&gt; is given, it becomes the name of the application as it
is known by OS/2. This name can be any valid file name. If &lt;appname&gt;
is not given, the name of the executable file - with the extension removed
- becomes the name of the application.
<P>
If &lt;apptype&gt; is given, it defines the type of application:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
WINDOWAPI<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->

application uses the API provided by the Presentation Manager and must be
executed in the Presentation Manager environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WINDOWCOMPAT
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Application compatible with Presentation Manager.
The application can run inside the Presentation Manager, or it can run in
a separate screen group. An application can be of this type if it uses the
proper subset of OS/2 video, keyboard, and mouse functions supported in
the Presentation Manager applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> NOTWINDOWCOMPAT
<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Application that is not compatible with the Presentation
Manager and must operate in a separate screen group from the Presentation
Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

If the NAME statement appears, the LIBRARY, VIRTUAL DEVICE and PHYSICAL
DEVICE statements cannot appear. If none of these statements appear, the
module definition file is assumed to describe an application.
