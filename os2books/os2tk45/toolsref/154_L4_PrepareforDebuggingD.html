<H1>Prepare for Debugging (/DE)</H1><!-- entering slot 159 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>  /DE[BUG]
<P>
The /DE option is used to prepare for debugging with any debugger.  With
this option, LINK386 embeds symbolic data and line number information in
the executable output file.
<P>
You can run this executable file outside Debug; the debugging information
in the file is ignored.  However, to reduce executable file size, use this
option only for debugging.  Then you can link a separate version without
the /DE option after the program is debugged.
