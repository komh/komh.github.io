<P>
This option directs LINK386 to set the alignment factor in the executable
file to the number given, which must be a power of 2, from 2 to 32768. The
default alignment is 512 bytes. Trailing zeroes are truncated to reduce
the amount of data stored in a file.
<P>
Each page starts at a location that is a multiple of<I> n</I> bytes from
the beginning of the file.  For example, /A:16 would start pages at multiples
of 16 bytes.
<P>
Link386 produces pages that are a maximum of 4096 bytes in length. Alignment
factors greater than 4096 will waste disk space.
