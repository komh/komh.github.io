<H1>Character Strings</H1><!-- entering slot 374 -->
<P>
A character string, which may also be called a string constant or string
literal, contains a sequence of characters or escape sequences enclosed
in double quotation mark symbols. Character strings represent names, labels,
titles, and messages.  The meaning of each character value depends on the
code page (character set) defined for the resource script file.
<P>
A string constant has the form:
<PRE>       ┌───────────────────┐
 &gt;───"─┴┬──character──────┬┴─"───────────────────────────────────────&gt;
        └─escape_sequence─┘
</PRE>

<P>
Where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
character<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> The ASCII value of the character must
be in the range 1 through 255.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> escape_sequence<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> You
can represent any member of the character set by an escape sequence. For
example, you can use escape sequences to place such characters as tab, carriage
return, and backspace in the character string.  An escape sequence contains
a backslash (\) character followed by one of the escape sequence characters:
a, b, f, n, r, t, v, ', ", ?, \ or followed by an octal or hexadecimal number.

<P>
A hexadecimal escape sequence contains an character x followed by one or
more hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F, a-f).  An octal escape sequence contains
one or more octal digits (0-7).  The value of the hexadecimal or octal number
specifies the value of the desired character.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An escape sequence has the form:
<PRE> &gt;───\──┬─escape_sequence_character─┬───────────────────────────────&gt;&lt;        ├─octal_digits──────────────┤
        └─x─hexadecimal_digits──────┘

</PRE>

<P>
When you want the backslash to represent itself (rather than the beginning
of an escape sequence), you must use a \\ (two backslashes) escape sequence.

<P>
If two consecutive strings appear on the same source line without any space
between these two strings, the strings will be merged with an embedded quote.

<PRE>    /* Source Line 1 */ "String 1""String 2"
</PRE>

<P>
Here two strings are specified on the same line with no space between the
strings.  These strings will be merged as - String 1"String 2.  Here the
ending double quote of first string and begin double quote of second string
creates the effect of embedded double quotes inside the merged string. These
consecutive double quote characters will be translated as a single double
quote character.  This is the same representation as shown below:
<PRE>    /* Source Line 1 */ "String 1\"String 2"
</PRE>

<P>
Here an escape sequence \" is used to include double quote character inside
the string.  This is the recommended representation to include a double
quote character inside the string.
<P>
If one or more consecutive strings are separated by one or more spaces (the
end of source line is considered as space also), then strings will be concatenated
to produce a single string.  See the following example:
<PRE>    /* Source Line 1 */ "String 3:" "String 4",
    /* Source Line 2 */ "String 5:"
    /* Source Line 3 */ "String 6"
</PRE>

<P>
The two strings "String 3:" and "String 4" specified on source line 1 are
on the same line separated with a single blank.  These two strings will
be concatenated as shown below:
<PRE>    String 3:String 4
</PRE>

<P>
The two strings "String 5:" and "String 6" specified on source lines 2 and
3 are on different source lines.  These two strings will be concatenated
the same way as with strings specified on source line 1.
<PRE>    String 5:String 6
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the comma had been specified after the "String 4" in source line
1 to stop the concatenation of strings on source lines 2 and 3.  If that
comma had not been specified, then all the strings on source lines 1, 2,
and 3 would have been merged as shown in the following example:
<PRE>    String 3:String4String5:String6
</PRE>

<P>
If the string has no ending double quote mark at the end of the source line,
then the physical end of source line will generate a newline character as
part of the string data.
<PRE>    "This string on source line 1
    is continued on source line 2"
</PRE>

<P>
<!-- entering slot 375 -->In the above example, the newline character (hex
0A) will be inserted after character 1.  This representation is equivalent
to the following example.
<PRE>    "This string on source line 1\nis continued on source line 2"
</PRE>

<P>
Here the escape sequence \n is used to generate newline character (hex 0A)
between two strings.
<PRE>    "String on Line 1
      String on Line 2"
</PRE>

<P>
In the above example, the second string on line 2 is specified with two
leading spaces.  These leading spaces will be part of the string data.  If
you do not want any leading space on the strings that span next lines, then
start the strings in column 1 on the next lines.  This representation is
equivalent to the following example.
<PRE>    "String on Line 1\n  String on Line 2"

    You can use an another approach like the following example:

    "String on Line 1\n"
                   " String on Line 2"
</PRE>

<P>
This approach is more readable.  Here the concatenation operation will be
performed on both strings without worry about the leading spaces before
the string " String on Line 2".  Leading spaces are provided inside the
second string so you can place second string on the next line at the indented
place.  See the following STRINGTABLE statement example.
<PRE>    STRINGTABLE
    {
       1, "The data on disk will be erased\n"
          "Are you sure (Y/N) \?"
    }
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the escape sequence \n to represent a new-line character as
part of the string.  You can use the escape \\ to represent a backslash
character as part of the string.  You can use the escape \" to present the
double quotation mark symbol as part of the string.  You can include any
ASCII character in a character string by specifying \xdd, where dd is the
hexadecimal representation of an ASCII character.  An error message is issued
if an escape sequence is not recognized.
<P>
In addition, when character strings are used as resource identifiers additional
rules apply:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They must be enclosed in double quotation marks (").
 If a double quotation mark is needed inside the string, it is encoded as
two consecutive double quotation marks.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They cannot contain any character larger than 0x7F.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They must be delimited by whitespace, just as an integer
ID is.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Resources whose resource ID is compiled into a 16-bit
value in the binary data area, such as MENUITEM with its menu-id field,
or HELPSUBITEM with its child-window-id field, cannot use character strings
for IDs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They can contain an embedded newline character by
continuing the string on the following line without closing the string.
 When the input file represents newlines as 0x0D+0x0A or by 0x0D+0x0D+0x0A,
the string is compiled with the sequence 0x0A to represent the newline.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Duplicate string IDs are not permitted for resources
of the same type.  However, the same string resource identifier can be used
to identify resources of different types.
<P>
When the Resource Compiler is compiling a script file and encounters more
than one resource of the same type having the same string ID, it will generate
an error message and stop compiling the file.  When the Resource Compiler
is binding a .RES file and encounters more than one resource of the same
type with the same string ID, it will generate a warning message and ignore
the second resource identifier; only the first resource having the duplicated
identifier will be bound to the file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
