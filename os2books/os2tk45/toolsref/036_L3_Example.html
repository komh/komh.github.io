The control menu lists, in alphabetic order, all the controls that you can
put in a dialog box. The sample dialog is <A HREF="060_L3_SampleDialogTemplate.html">Sample
Dialog Template File</A>. To add controls for a sample dialog, follow these
steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select<B> Text</B> from the<B> Control</B> menu
or select a control by clicking on its icon on the Control Palette at the
right side of the window.
<P>
The pointer becomes a small plus sign (+) in a square.  The center marks
the position where the center of the control will be.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Position the pointer inside the dialog box near
the upper-left corner and click the mouse.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Type Student Level: in the<B> Text</B> entry
field. Observe that the next sequential integer is supplied in the<B> Symbol
</B>entry field.  Press Enter.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Replace the symbol with<B> ID_GRAD</B> and press
Enter.
<P>
The Dialog editor assigns the next integer to the symbolic identifier you
entered and places it in the include file. This is another technique for
entering symbolic identifiers.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To view or change the include file at any time,
select<B> Symbols</B> from the<B> Edit</B> menu. The<B> Symbols</B> dialog
appears.

are displayed in the list box. The dialog allows you to add, delete, and
change the identifiers and to view the hexadecimal equivalents of the integers.

<P>
Select the<B> OK</B> push button to remove the dialog and register any changes.
Select<B> Cancel</B> if you have not made any changes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In your dialog box, the static control is not
large enough for you to see all the text. To remedy this, click on the text,
and a border appears around it. Drag the right-hand edge of the border to
the right to enlarge the field.
<P>
When you release the mouse button, you should be able to see all the text.
When a control has a border around it, it is selected and you can use a
shadow box to position it, as you did with the dialog box.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

to enlarge it.  The bottom of the group box border should be lower than
the last of the radio buttons, and the right-hand side of the group box
should be almost at the far right of the dialog box.  This is to make room
for a group of check boxes that will go inside the group box.
<P>
When you use group boxes to group controls, you always create the group
box before the controls that are to go inside it.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 14.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
