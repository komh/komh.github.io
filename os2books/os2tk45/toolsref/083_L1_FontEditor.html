<P>
You can use the OS/2 Font Editor to design and save your own fonts for use
in applications.
<P>
A<I> font</I> is a set of alphanumeric characters, punctuation marks, and
other symbols that share a common typeface design and line weight. An application
loads a font from a dynamic-link library file (.DLL file).
<P>
The Font Editor allows you to edit an enlarged version of each character
in an editing window, using the mouse to switch the enlarged representation
of pels to black or white.
<P>
You can change a series of pels by dragging the mouse pointer through them
while holding down the mouse button. An enlarged scale version of the character
is shown in a viewing window to the right of the edit window.
