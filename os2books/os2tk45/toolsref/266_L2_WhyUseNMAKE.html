<H1>Why Use NMAKE?</H1><!-- entering slot 273 -->
<P>
The most common use of NMAKE is to automate the process of updating a project
after you make a change to a source file.  Large projects tend to have many
source files.  Often, only a few of your source files need to be compiled
when you make a change.  You set up a special text file called a "description"
file, or a "makefile", that tells NMAKE:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Which files depend on others<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Which commands, such as compile and link commands,
need to be carried out to bring your program up-to-date<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This use of NMAKE is only one example of its power.  By building suitable
description files, you can use NMAKE to<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make backups<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Configure
data files<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Run programs when data files are modified<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
