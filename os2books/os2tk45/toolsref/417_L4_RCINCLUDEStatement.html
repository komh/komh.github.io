<H1>RCINCLUDE Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 431 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>  RCINCLUDE filename
</PRE>

<P>
The RCINCLUDE statement causes RC to process the resource script file specified
in the filename field along with the current resource script file.  The
contents of both files are compiled by RC and the results are placed in
one binary resource file and/or executable file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
filename<!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Specifies the name of the resource script
file to be included. If the file is not in the current directory, filename
must be preceded by a full path.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
RCINCLUDE statements are processed before any other processing is done.

<P>
When specifying a high performance file system (HPFS) file name on an RCINCLUDE
statement, enclose the path and file name in double quotes; for example:

<PRE>   RCINCLUDE "d:\project\long dialog.dlg"</PRE>

<P>
Double quotes enables the Resource Compiler to recognize a name containing
embedded blank characters.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example includes the file DIALOGS.RC as part of the current resource
script file.
<PRE>RCINCLUDE dialogs.rc
</PRE>
