<H1>Font Resource Files</H1><!-- entering slot 91 -->
<P>
The Font Editor creates a file with a .FNT extension. The .FNT file is not
referred to in the same resource file as other resources.
<P>
Instead, it has its own resource file that contains a single-line statement
that has a similar format to the ICON, POINTER, and BITMAP statements, for
example:
<PRE>FONT  101      myfont.fnt     /* Font */
</PRE>

<P>
The FONT keyword identifies the resource type.
<P>
The resource type is followed by an integer identifier that is used by the
application to identify the resource. The integer is used as a parameter
to the WinCreateStdWindow call. You cannot use a symbolic name for a font.

<P>
The integer identifier can be followed by loading and memory options. Again,
the example lets them default.
<P>
The last part of the statement is the file name of the resource created
by the Font Editor. A full path name must be given if it is not in the current
directory.
<P>
Producing a font file uses a process similar to binding resources to an
.EXE file. You bind one or more .FNT files to a dummy .DLL, to produce a
file containing the font or fonts. The final file should have the extension
.FON.
<P>
The .FON file created by the process is installed on the system and becomes
a<I> public</I> font, a font that can be used by any application in the
system.
<P>
A font not installed on the system is called a<I> private</I> font. Before
your application can use the font, your application must use GpiLoadFonts
to load the .FON file.
