<H1>MEM32 Keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 468 -->
<P>
This is used to log memory in a function compiled using 32-bit flat addressing
and is coded as:
<PRE>        MEM32=(address_spec,flag,{length|LEN}),
</PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
address_spec<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a flat memory address specification
as described in <A HREF="456_L4_AddressSpecification.html">Address Specification</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>flag<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> is a mandatory parameter
that identifies the level of indirection to be used on the address. The
<I>flag</I> may be one of the following:
<PRE>D[IRECT]
I[NDIRECT][*[{+|-}iiiiiiii]]...
IS
</PRE>

<P>
DIRECT implies that the address specifies a memory location to be saved
in the trace buffer.
<P>
INDIRECT means that the address contains a flat address and is dereferenced
to obtain the memory location. The optional asterisks denote the level of
indirection, one for each level.  The indirect offsets<B> iiiiiiii</B> are
added to or subtracted from the value found at the given level of indirection.

<P>
IS (Indirect Segmented) means that the address contains a segmented address
that is dereferenced to obtain the memory location.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> length
<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL>is the number of bytes at the memory location to
be saved in the trace buffer. If<I> length</I> is too big, a warning message
will be given, and<I> length</I> will be set to MAXDATALENGTH. If<I> length
</I>is 0 an error message will be given, and this tracepoint will be ignored.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>LEN<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
<UL> specifies that this
is a variable length record to log and the length was specified by the preceding
LEN statement. If there was no preceding LEN statement, this tracepoint
is rejected. Either length or LEN must be specified, but not both.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following is an example of the MEM32 statement:
<PRE>     TRACE MINOR=.....           /* To log retcode enter the following: */
           MEM32=(.retcode,DIRECT,2),

           /* s_ptr is a pointer to a structure, log it for 4 bytes. */
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,4),

           /* Field 6 bytes into structure pointed at by s_ptr is a     */
           /*  pointer to a structure, log 8 bytes past begin of struct.*/
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT*+6*+8,10),  /* logs ten bytes */

           /* s_ptr points to a variable length record, second field */
           /*  is the record length (offset 4 from record beginning).*/
           LEN=(s_ptr,INDIRECT*+4),
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,LEN)

           /* s_end points to the end of same variable length record,*/
           /*  second field is the record length (offset -6 from     */
           /*  record beginning).                                    */
           LEN=(s_end,INDIRECT*-6),
           MEM32=(.s_ptr,INDIRECT,LEN)
</PRE>
