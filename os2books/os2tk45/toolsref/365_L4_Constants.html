<P>
Constants are names that have been assigned values by using a #define directive
or a -D command-line option.  A constant can represent a number, a character
string, or other data.  Most resource statements in a resource script file
use constants, and many use the constants defined in system header files.
 For this reason, you should consider using the #include directive to include
the appropriate system header file in your resource script file.
