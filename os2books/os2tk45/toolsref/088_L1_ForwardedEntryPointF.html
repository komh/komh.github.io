<H1>Forwarded Entry Point (FWDSTAMP)</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
FWDSTAMP adds entry points, called<I> forwarders</I>, to a dynamic link
library file (.DLL). Forwarders point to API functions or other exported
code or data. They contain an import reference so that the final target
address of the forwarded entry is contained in a different module. A forwarder
might be called an<I> imported export</I>.
<P>
When a file has a fix-up to a forwarded entry point, the loader resolves
that fix-up to the address of the entry point that the forwarder imports,
by traversing the chain of forwarders until the end of the chain (a nonforwarded
export) is reached.  All forwarders are implicitly exported.
<P>
The imported entry point that a forwarder refers to may itself be another
forwarder. The loader will process a chain of forwarders until a nonforwarder
entry point is encountered.
<P>
There is no<I> run-time</I> cost to forwarders; however, there is a slight
<I>load-time</I> cost as the loader resolves forwarder chains with their
final addresses.
