<H1>Environment Variable</H1><!-- entering slot 153 -->
<P>
You can use the LINK386 environment variable to cause certain options to
be used each time you link.  LINK386 checks the environment variable for
options if the variable exists.
<P>
LINK386 expects to find options listed in the variable exactly as you would
type them on the command line.  It does not accept other kinds of arguments;
file names in the environment variable cause the following error message:

<PRE>unrecognized option</PRE>

<P>
Each time you link, you can specify other options in addition to the ones
specified in the LINK386 environment variable. If you type an option both
on the Syntax and in the environment variable, the effect is the same as
if the option were given once.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A command line option overrides the effect of any environment-variable
option that it conflicts with.  For example, the command line option /SE:512
cancels the effect of the environment-variable option /SE:256.
<P>
The only way to prevent an option in the environment variable from being
used is to reset the environment variable itself.
