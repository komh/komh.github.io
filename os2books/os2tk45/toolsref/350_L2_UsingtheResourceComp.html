<H1>Using the Resource Compiler</H1><!-- entering slot 360 -->
<P>
The Resource Compiler (RC) compiles a resource script file to create a new
file called a binary resource file.
<P>
The binary resource file can be added to the executable file of the application,
replacing any existing resources in that file.
<P>
You can start RC in any of three ways.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Compile and add a resource definition file to an executable
file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Compile a resource script file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Add a binary resource file to an executable file<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The RC command line has the following three basic forms:
<PRE>  rc resource-script-file [executable-file]
  rc resource-file [executable-file]

  rc -r  resource-script-file [resource-file]
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The third option does not add to the executable file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
 
<P>
The<B> resource-script-file</B> field must be the file name of the resource
script file to be compiled.  If the file is not in the current directory,
you must provide a full path.  If you provide a file name without specifying
an extension, RC automatically appends the .RC extension to the name.
<P>
The<B> executable-file</B> field must be the name of the executable file
to receive the compiled resources.  This is a file having an extension of
either .EXE or .DLL.  If the file is not in the current directory, you must
provide a full path.  If you omit the executable-file field, RC adds the
compiled resources to the executable file that has the same name as the
resource script file but which has the .EXE file extension.  If you specify
the executable-file field but omit the extension, RC will append the .EXE
extension.  If this executable file does not exist, RC displays an error
message.
<P>
The<B> -r</B> option directs RC to compile the resource script file without
adding it to an executable file.  You can use this option to prepare a binary
resource file that you can add to an executable file at a later time.  If
you do not explicitly name a binary resource file along with the -r option,
RC uses the same name as the resource script file but with the .RES extension.

<P>
The<B> resource-file</B> field must be the name of the binary resource file
to be added to the executable file.  If the binary resource file does not
already exist, RC creates it; otherwise, RC replaces the existing file.
 If the file is not in the current directory, you must provide a full path.
 The binary resource file must have the .RES extension.
<P>
For example, to compile the resource script file EXAMPLE.RC, and add the
result to the executable file EXAMPLE.EXE, use the following command:
<PRE>  rc example
</PRE>

<P>
You do not need to specify the .RC extension. RC creates the binary resource
file EXAMPLE.RES and adds the compiled resource to the executable file EXAMPLE.EXE.

<P>
To compile the resource script file EXAMPLE.RC into a binary resource file
without adding the resources to an executable file, use the following command:

<PRE>  rc -r example
</PRE>

<P>
The compiler creates the binary resource file EXAMPLE.RES. To create a binary
resource file that has a name different from the resource script file, use
the following command:
<PRE>  rc -r example newfile.res
</PRE>

<P>
To add the compiled resources in the binary resource file EXAMPLE.RES to
an executable file, use the following command:
<PRE>  rc example.res
</PRE>

<P>
To specify the name of the executable file, if the name is different from
the resource file, use the following command:
<PRE>  rc example.res newfile.exe
</PRE>

<P>
To add the compiled resources to a dynamic-link-library (.DLL) file, use
the following command:
<PRE>  rc example.res dynalink.dll
</PRE>
