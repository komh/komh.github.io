<B>Purpose</B>
<P>
OS/2 provides a mechanism by which developers may dynamically apply tracepoints
in their module at run time.  This method eliminates all overhead of tracing
when tracing is disabled. It also allows the developer to add tracepoints
without modifying source code.  This reduces the possibility that adding
a tracepoint will induce errors into one's code.  OS/2 needs a binary file,
for each module being dynamically traced, which defines the tracepoints
for the module.

<B>Description</B>
<P>
The Trace Customizer (TRCUST) converts tracepoint definitions from a trace
source file (TSF) into dynamic tracepoints for the trace definition file
(TDF), and into formatting rules in the trace format file (TFF). For more
information see <A HREF="429_L1_DynamicTraceCustomiz.html">Dynamic Trace
Customizer (TRCUST)</A>.
