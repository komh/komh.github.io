<UL> seg disp. included near<I> location</I> in
segment<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  This error is caused by using the LINK386 <A HREF="178_L4_WarningofFixupsW.html">Warning
of Fix-ups (/W)</A> option.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The segment name and the location offset is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4001
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>frame-relative fix-up, frame ignored near<I> location
</I>in segment<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A fix up occurred with a frame segment different from
the target segment where either the frame or the target segment is not absolute.
Such a fix-up is meaningless in the OS/2 environment, so the target segment
is assumed for the frame segment. This error sometimes occurs if a 32-bit
data item is referenced as if it were in a 16-bit segment or a 16-bit segment
referenced as if it were in a 32-bit segment.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check that this is acceptable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4002
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>frame-relative absolute fix-up near<I> location
</I>in segment<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A fix up occurred with a frame segment different from
the target segment where both frame and target segments are absolute. This
fix up is processed using base-offset arithmetic, but the warning is issued
because the fix up might not be valid in the OS/2 environment. This error
sometimes occurs if a 32-bit data item is referenced as if it were in a
16-bit segment or a 16-bit segment referenced as if it were in a 32-bit
segment.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check that this is acceptable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>illegal 16-bit flat-relative offset fix-up at<I> location
</I>in object<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  LINK386 encountered an illegal 16-bit flat relative
offset fix-up at the specified location. This might cause a problem with
the executable file. This error sometimes occurs if a 32-bit data item is
referenced as if it were in a 16-bit segment or a 16-bit segment referenced
as if it were in a 32-bit segment.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  The error might have been caused by the way the program
was written or when it was compiled or assembled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL> L4020
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: code segment size exceeds 65,500
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The code segment indicated is larger than 65,500 bytes
and might not be reliable.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Break the segment into smaller segments and try again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4021
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>no stack segment
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The program does not contain a stack segment defined
with the STACK combine type. Normally, every .EXE program should have a
stack segment with the combine type specified as STACK.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  You can ignore this message if you have a specific reason
for not defining a stack or for defining one without the STACK combine type.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L4022<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name1, name2</I>:
groups overlap
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  Two groups are defined in such a way that one starts
in the middle of another. This can occur if you defined segments in a module
definition file or assembly file and did not correctly order the segments
by class.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file and reorder the segments in the group.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L4023<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I> (alias):
export internal name conflict
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> An exported name, or its associated internal name,
conflicts with an already defined public symbol.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file using new names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4024
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: multiple definitions for export name

<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The module named has been exported more than<!-- entering slot 508 --> once
with different internal names. All internal names except the first one are
ignored.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file using new names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4025
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>modname impname (intname)</I>: import internal
name conflict
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An imported name, or its associated internal name,
is also defined as an exported name. The import name is ignored. The conflict
could come from a definition in either the module definition file or an
object file.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file or module definition file using new
names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4026<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> modname
impname (intname)</I>: self-imported
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The module definition file directed that a name be
imported from the module being produced.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B> Edit the module definition file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4027
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: multiple definitions for import internal
name
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  An imported name, or its associated internal name,
is imported more than once. The imported name is ignored after the first
mention.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check that the name has been defined correctly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4028
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: segment already defined
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> A segment is defined more than once with the same name
in the module definition file. Segments must have unique names for LINK386.
All definitions with the same name are ignored after the first mention.

<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check that the segment has been defined correctly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4029
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: DGROUP segment converted to type data

<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A segment that is a member of DGROUP has been defined
as type CODE in a module definition file or object file. This probably happened
because a CLASS keyword in a SEGMENTS statement was not given.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check the module definition file syntax.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4030
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: segment attributes changed to conform
with automatic data segment
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The segment named is defined in DGROUP, but the<I> shared
</I>attribute is in conflict with the<I> instance</I> attribute.
<BR>
<B>Example: </B>  The<I> shared</I> attribute is NONSHARED and the<I> instance
</I>attribute is SINGLE, or the<I> shared</I> attribute is SHARED and the
<I>instance</I> attribute is MULTIPLE. The bad segment is forced to have
the right<I> shared</I> attribute and the link continues.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Check that the LINK386 action is acceptable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4031
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I>name</I>: segment declared in more than one group

<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A segment is declared to be a member of two different
groups.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Correct the source file and re-create the object files.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>L4032<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><I> name</I>: code-group
size exceeds 65500 bytes
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The code group indicated is larger than 65500 bytes
and therefore might not be reliable.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Break the group into smaller groups or remove one or more
segments and try again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4036<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> no
automatic data segment
<BR>
<B>Explanation: </B> The program or dynamic link library did not define
a group named DGROUP. This is recognized by LINK386 as the automatic data
segment.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Edit the source file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4038<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> program
has no starting address
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  The program did not contain a starting address. Physical
Device Drivers do not have program starting addresses, so this error can
be ignored when linking Physical Device Drives.
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  Recompile the program and try again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4044
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

</UL> L4045
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>name of output file is<I> name</I>
<BR>
<B>Explanation:</B>  A dynamic link library file was created without specifying
an extension.  In such cases, LINK386 supplies an extension of .DLL.  This
is to warn you in case you expected an .EXE file to be generated
<BR>
<B>Action:</B>  No action.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> L4046<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL> DATA
