<H1>Dialog Editor</H1><!-- entering slot 27 -->
<P>

<P>
You use the<I> Dialog Editor</I> to create and modify dialog boxes, and
to create and modify the controls and text within dialog boxes. As you create
the dialog box and its controls, you see them on the screen as the user
will see them when your program is run. You can place each dialog box and
its controls where you want them on the screen. In addition, you can test
the dialog box before you incorporate it into your application.
<P>
Each dialog box and control can have either an integer identifier or a symbolic
identifier that equates to an integer identifier. You use the identifier
in your application to refer to the dialog box or control. If you intend
to use symbolic identifiers in your application, you must enter the symbolic
and integer identifiers in an include file.  If you do not use symbolic
names, the Dialog Editor supplies an integer identifier for each control
and for the dialog box itself.  You can use the Dialog Editor to create
the include file, or you can use a text editor to create the include file
before using the Dialog Editor.
<P>
It is good programming practice to plan the resources that your application
will use and to choose a naming and numbering convention for the symbolic
or integer identifiers before you create them.  Keep the include file separate
from other include files used by your application. The Dialog Editor will
use only #define statements from an include file. It ignores everything
else it finds in the file.
<P>
Although the Dialog Editor draws dialog boxes and controls on the screen
so you can see what they look like when used by your application, it does
<I>not</I> save them as graphics.  Instead, the Dialog Editor saves them
in an ASCII-text format file that has a .DLG extension.  Refer to the dialog
template section of this chapter.
<P>
The Dialog Editor also creates a compiled form of the .DLG file in a resource
file with a .RES extension. The .DLG and .RES files can contain more than
one dialog box.  The resource file can contain other application resources,
such as icons, bit maps, and string tables.  It is attached to the executable
(.EXE) file of the application during the compile and link process.
