<H1>Set Maximum Number of Segments (/SE)</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>  /SE[GMENTS]:number
<P>
This option sets the number of logical segments a program can have. You
can set &lt;number&gt; to any value in the range 1 to 3,072. See <A HREF="147_L3_EnteringNumericArgum.html">Entering
Numeric Arguments</A>.
<P>
For each logical segment, LINK386 must allocate space to keep track of segment
information.  By using a relatively low segment limit as a default (128),
LINK386 is able to link faster and allocate less storage space.
<P>
When you set the segment limit higher than 128, LINK386 allocates more space
for segment information.  This option allows you to raise the segment limit
for programs with a large number of segments.
<P>
For programs with fewer than 128 segments, you can keep the storage requirements
of LINK386 at the lowest level possible by setting the segment &lt;number&gt;
field to reflect the actual number of segments in the program.  If the number
of segments allocated is too high for the amount of memory LINK386 has available
to it, you see the error message segment limit too high.
<P>
To specify a number of segments that fits in the amount of memory available,
set the segment lower and relink.
