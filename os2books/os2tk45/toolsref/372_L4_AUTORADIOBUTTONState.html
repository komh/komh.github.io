<P>
The AUTORADIOBUTTON statement creates an automatic-radio-button control.
 This control is a small circle with the given text displayed to its right.
 The control highlights the circle and sends a message to its parent window
when the user selects the button.  The control also removes the selection
from any other automatic-radio-button controls in the same group.  When
the user selects the button again, the control removes the highlight before
sending a message.  The AUTORADIOBUTTON statement, which you can use only
in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement, defines the text, identifier, dimensions,
and attributes of a control window.  The predefined class for this control
is WC_BUTTON.  If you do not specify a style, the default style is BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON.

the double quotation mark twice.  A tilde ( ~ ) character in the text indicates
that the following character is used as a mnemonic character for the control.
 When the control is displayed, the tilde is not shown, but the mnemonic
character is underlined. The user can choose the control by pressing the
key corresponding to the underlined mnemonic character.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>id<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control identifier. This value
must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned

to a value in these ranges.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>x<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>y<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> This value must be a signed integer in the
range -32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the
addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to
be in dialog units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window,
or control containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>width<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the width of the control.  This
value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression consisting
of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The width
is in n-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>height<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the height of the control.
 This value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression
consisting of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.
 The height is in 1/8-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>style<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control styles.  This value
