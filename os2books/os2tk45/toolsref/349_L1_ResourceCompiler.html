<P>
The OS/2 Resource Compiler (RC) is an application-development tool that
lets you add application resources, such as message strings, pointers, menus,
and dialog boxes, to the executable file of your application. The Resource
Compiler is primarily intended to prepare data for OS/2 applications that
use functions such as WinLoadString, WinLoadPointer, WinLoadMenu, and WinLoadDlg.
 These functions load resources from the executable file of your application
or another specified executable file.  The application can then use the
loaded resources as needed.
<P>
The Resource Compiler and the resource functions let you quickly define
and/or modify application resources without recompiling the application
itself.  That is, RC can modify the resources in an executable file at any
time without affecting the rest of the file. This means that you can create
custom applications from a single executable file - you just use RC to add
the custom resources you need to each application.
<P>
The Resource Compiler is especially important for international applications
because it lets you define all language-dependent data, such as message
strings, as resources.  Preparing the application for a new language is
simply a matter of adding new resources to the existing executable file.
