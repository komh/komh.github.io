<H1>Index Files for Rapid Search</H1><!-- entering slot 121 -->
<P>
The KwikINF index file provides a rapid-search mechanism for locating specific
kinds of information in online documents in the BOOKSHELF. The KwikINF index
file consists of one or more concatenated files stored in the BOOKSHELF
and defined by the HELPNDX variable in CONFIG.SYS as shown in the following
example:
<PRE>
SET   HELPNDX = EPMKWHLP . NDX
</PRE>

<P>
where EPMKWHLP.NDX is the KwikINF index file for the OS/2 Toolkit.
<P>
As an example, the following excerpt from the KwikINF index file for the
OS/2 Toolkit:
<PRE>EXTENSIONS: *
DESCRIPTION: IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2
(IPF*, view ipfc20.inf ~)
(WinCreateWindow, view pmwin.inf ~)
</PRE>

<P>
is used by KwikINF to quickly locate<B> Search String</B> entries with the
prefix IPF in the IPF-viewable file IPFC20.INF. and to quickly locate the
specific<B> Search String</B> entry WinCreateWindow in the IPF-viewable
file PMWIN.INF.
<P>
The first token in a rapid-search string is a specific text string (for
example, WinCreateWindow) or prefix wildcard (for example, IPF*).  It is
also used as the text-string you want VIEW.EXE to locate within the online
document. The second token is the name of the IPF file viewer (VIEW.EXE).
The third token is a parameter for VIEW.EXE: the name of the .INF file that
contains the online document.  Currently, the fourth token is not being
used and it is treated as a comment.
