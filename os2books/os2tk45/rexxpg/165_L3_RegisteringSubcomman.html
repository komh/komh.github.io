<H1>Registering Subcommand Handlers</H1><!-- entering slot 175 -->
<P>
A subcommand handler can reside in the same module (EXE or DLL) as an application,
or it can reside in a separate dynamic link library. An application that
runs REXX procedures with RexxStart should use RexxRegisterSubcomExe to
register subcommand handlers. The REXX interpreter passes commands to the
application subcommand handler entry point. Subcommand handlers created
using RexxRegisterSubcomExe are available only to REXX programs called from
the registering application.
<P>
The RexxRegisterSubcomDll interface creates subcommand handlers that reside
in a dynamic link library. Any REXX program using the REXX ADDRESS instruction
can access a dynamic link library subcommand handler. A dynamic link library
subcommand handler can also be registered directly from a REXX program using
the RXSUBCOM command.
