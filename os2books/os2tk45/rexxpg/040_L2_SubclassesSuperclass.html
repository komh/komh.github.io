<P>
When you write your first object-oriented program, you do not have to begin
your real-world modeling from scratch. REXX has done some of this up-front
work for you, providing predefined classes and methods. From there you can
create additional classes and methods of your own, as you need them.
<P>
REXX classes are hierarchical. Any<I> subclass</I> (classes below a class
in the hierarchy) will<I> inherit,</I> or be able to use, the methods and
variables of one or more<I> superclasses</I> (classes above a class in the
hierarchy).

Superclass and subclasses

  ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
<BR>
  │       │       │
<BR>
Subclass    Subclass    Subclass
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
You can add a class to an existing superclass. For example, you might add
the Icon class to the Screen-Object superclass:
<BR>
The Screen-Object superclass
<BR>

<BR>
      Screen-Object class
<BR>
          │
<BR>
   ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
<BR>
   │       │       │
<BR>
 Icon class  Window class  Bitmap class
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
Doing this lets the subclass inherit additional methods from the superclass.
Sometimes a class may have more than one superclass. (Subclass Bitmap might
have superclasses Screen-Object<I> and</I> Art-Object.) Acquiring methods
and variables from more than one superclass is known as<I> multiple inheritance</I>.
