<H1>Methods Are "Coded Actions"</H1><!-- entering slot 40 -->
<P>
Sending a message to an object results in performing some action; that is,
it results in running some underlying code. The action-generating code is
called a<I> method</I>. When you send a message to an object, you specify
its method name in the message. (Method names are simply character strings,
like "REVERSE.") Doing this runs the method with the corresponding name.
In the preceding example, sending the reverse message to the !iH object
causes it to run the REVERSE method. Most objects are capable of more than
one action, and so have a number of available methods.
<P>
The classes REXX provides include their own predefined methods. The Message
class, for example, has the COMPLETED, INIT, NOTIFY, RESULT, SEND, and START
methods. When you create your own classes, you can write new methods for
them in REXX code. Much of the object programming in REXX is writing the
code for the methods you create.
