<H1>Using Quotation Marks</H1><!-- entering slot 122 -->
<P>
The rules for forming a command from an expression are exactly the same
as those for forming expressions. Be careful of symbols that have meanings
for both REXX and OS/2 programs. The DIRREX.CMD program below shows how
REXX evaluates a command when the command name and a variable name are the
same:
<PRE>/* DIRREX.CMD -- assign a value to the symbol DIR */
say "DIR command using REXX"
<B>dir = "echo This is not a directory."</B>

/* pass the evaluated variable to OS/2            */
dir
</PRE>

<P>
Because Dir is a variable that contains a string, the string is passed to
OS/2. The OS/2 DIR command is not executed. Here are the results:
<PRE>[C:\]dirrex
DIR command using REXX:
This is not a directory.
[C:\]
</PRE>

<P>
REXX evaluates a literal string--a string enclosed in matching quotation
marks--exactly as it is. To ensure that a symbol in a command is not evaluated
as a variable, enclose it in matching quotation marks as follows:
<PRE>/* assign a value to the symbol DIR       */
say "DIR command using REXX"
dir = "echo This is another string now."

/* pass the literal string "dir" to OS/2  */
<B>"dir"</B>
</PRE>

<P>
REXX displays a directory listing.
<P>
The best way to ensure that REXX passes a string to the OS/2 as a command
is to enclose the entire clause in quotation marks. This is especially important
when you use symbols that REXX uses as operators.
<P>
If you want to use a variable in the command string, leave the variable
outside the quotation marks. For example:
<PRE>extension = "BAK"
"delete *."▌▌extension

option = "/w"
"dir"▌▌option
</PRE>
