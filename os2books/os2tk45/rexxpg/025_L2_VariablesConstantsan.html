<H1>Variables, Constants, and Literal Strings</H1><!-- entering slot 26 -->
<P>
Comprehensive rules for variables, constants, and literal strings are contained
in the<I> Object REXX Reference</I>. If you've programmed in Basic or C,
you won't find anything too surprising about REXX's implementation.
<P>
You can name variables almost anything you want. REXX imposes few rules.
A variable name can be any<I> symbol</I> (group of characters), containing
up to 250 characters, with the following restrictions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The first character must be A-Z, a-z, !, ?, or _ .
REXX translates lowercase letters to uppercase before using them.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The rest of the characters may be A-Z, a-z, !, ?,
or _, ., or 0-9.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The period (.) has a special meaning for REXX variables.
Do not use it in a variable name until you understand the rules for forming
compound symbols.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Literal strings in REXX are delimited by quotation marks (either ' or ").
Examples of literal strings are:
<PRE>'Hello'"Final result:"
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to use quotation marks within a literal string, use quotation
marks of the other type to delimit the string. For example:
<PRE>"Don't panic"
'He said, "Bother"'
</PRE>

<P>
There's another way to do this. Within a literal string, a pair of quotation
marks (the same type that delimits the string) is interpreted as one of
that type. For example:
<PRE>'Don''t panic'                 (same as "Don't panic"      )
"He said, ""Bother"""          (same as 'He said, "Bother"')
</PRE>

<P>
