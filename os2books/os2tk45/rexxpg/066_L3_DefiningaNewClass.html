<H1>Defining a New Class</H1><!-- entering slot 70 -->
<P>
To define a new class using messages, you send a SUBCLASS message to the
new class's superclass. That is, send the message to the class that will
be immediately above the new class in the hierarchy. So, to define a subclass
of the Object class called Account, enter:
<PRE>account = .object~subclass('Account')
</PRE>

<P>
Here, .object is a reference to the REXX Object class. .Object is an environment
symbol indicating the intention to create a new class that is a subclass
of the Object class. Environment symbols represent objects in a directory
of public objects, called the<I> Environment object.</I> These public objects
are available to all other objects, and include all the classes that REXX
provides. Environment symbols begin with a period and are followed by the
class name. Thus the Object class is represented by .object, the Alarm class
by .alarm, the Array class by .array, and so on.
<P>
The "twiddle" (~) is the "message send" symbol, subclass is a method of
Class, and the string identifier in parentheses is an argument of SUBCLASS
that names the new class, Account.
