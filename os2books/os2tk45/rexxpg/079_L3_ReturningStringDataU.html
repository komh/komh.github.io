<H1>Returning String Data Using STRING</H1><!-- entering slot 83 -->
<P>
Another useful method is STRING. The STRING method is a handy way to access
object data and return it in string form for use by your program. When a
SAY instruction is processed in REXX, REXX automatically sends a STRING
message to the object specified in the expression. In doing this, REXX uses
the STRING method of the Object class and returns a human-readable string
representation for the object. For example, if you instruct REXX to say
a, and a is an array object, REXX returns "an array." You can take advantage
of this automatic use of STRING by overriding REXX's STRING method with
your own, and extract the object data itself--in this case, the actual array
data.
<P>
Let's look at two programs that demonstrate STRING and INIT. In the first
program, the Part class is created, and along with it, the two methods under
discussion, STRING and INIT:
<PRE>/* PARTDEF.CMD -- Class and method definition file */

/* Define the Part class as a public class */
::class part public

/* Define the INIT method to initialize object variables */
::method init
expose name description number
use arg name, description, number

/* Define the STRING method to return a string with the part name */
::method string
expose name
return "Part name:" name
</PRE>

<P>
On the ::CLASS directive, the keyword PUBLIC indicates that the class can
be shared with other programs. The two ::METHOD directives define INIT and
STRING. Whenever REXX creates a new instance of a class, it calls the INIT
method for the class. (We'll see how to create an instance of a class in
the next program.) Our INIT method uses an EXPOSE instruction to make the
name, description, and number variables available to other methods. These
exposed variables are object variables, and are associated with a particular
instance of a class.

<P>
INIT expects to be passed three arguments. The USE ARG instruction assigns
these three arguments to the name, description, and number variables, respectively.
Since those variables are exposed, the values are available to other methods.

<P>
The STRING method returns the string "Part name: ", followed by the name
of a part. The STRING method doesn't expect any arguments. It uses the EXPOSE
instruction to tap into the object variables. The RETURN instruction returns
the result string.
<P>
Now let's see how to use the Part class:
<PRE>/* USEPART.CMD  - use the Part class          */
myparta=.part~new('Widget','A small widge',12345)
mypartb=.part~new('Framistat','Device to control frams',899)
say myparta
say mypartb
exit
::requires partdef
</PRE>

<P>
The USEPART program creates two "parts", which are instances of the Part
class. It then displays the names of the two parts.
<P>
REXX processes all directives before running your program. The ::REQUIRES
directive indicates that the program needs access to public class definitions
that are in another program. In this case, the ::REQUIRES directive refers
to the PARTDEF program, which contains the Part definition.
<P>
Next, look at the two assignment statements for MypartA and MypartB. These
assignment statements create two objects that are instances of the Part
class. The objects are created by sending a NEW message to the Part class.
The NEW message causes the INIT method to be invoked as part of object creation.
Our INIT method takes the three arguments you provide and makes them part
of the object's own exclusive set of variables, called a<I> variable pool.
</I>Each object has its own variable pool (name, description, and number).

<P>
The SAY instruction, as we mentioned earlier, sends a STRING message to
the object. In the first SAY instruction, the STRING message is sent to
MypartA. The STRING method accesses the Name object variable for MypartA
and returns it as part of a string. In the second SAY instruction, the STRING
message is sent again,<!-- entering slot 84 --> but to a different object:
MypartB. Because the STRING method is invoked for MypartB, it automatically
accesses the variables for MypartB. Recall that you don't need to pass the
name of the object to the method in order to distinguish different sets
of object variables; REXX keeps track of them for you.
<P>
Another way to define classes is by using the SUBCLASS method. You can send
a SUBCLASS method to any desired superclass to create a class.
