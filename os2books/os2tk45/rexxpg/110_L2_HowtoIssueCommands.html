<H1>How to Issue Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->
<P>
REXX makes it easy to issue commands. The basic rule is that whatever REXX
cannot process, it passes to the default environment. You can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Let REXX evaluate part or all of a clause as an expression.
REXX automatically passes the resulting string to OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enclose the entire clause in quotation marks. That
renders it a literal string for REXX to pass to OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Send a command explicitly to OS/2 by using the ADDRESS
instruction.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
REXX processes your program one clause at a time. It examines each clause
to determine if it is:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A directive, such as ::CLASS or ::METHOD<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message instruction, such as:
<PRE>.array~new</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A keyword instruction, such as:
<PRE>say 'Type total number'
</PRE>

<P>
or
<PRE>pull input
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A variable assignment (any valid symbol followed by
an equal sign), such as:
<PRE>price = cost * 1.2
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A label for calling other routines<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A null (empty) clause<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the clause is none of the above, REXX evaluates the<I> entire clause
</I>as an expression and passes the resulting string to OS/2.
<P>
If the string is a valid OS/2 command, OS/2 processes it as though you had
typed the string at the command prompt and pressed the Enter key.
<P>
The following example shows a REXX clause that uses the DIR command to display
a list of files in the current directory.
<PRE>/* display current directory */say 'DIR command using REXX'
dir
</PRE>

<P>
The clause dir is not a REXX instruction or a label, so REXX evaluates it
and passes the resulting string to OS/2. OS/2 recognizes the string DIR
as one of its commands and processes it.
<P>
Letting REXX evaluate the command as an expression might cause problems,
however. Try adding a path to the DIR command in the above program (such
as, dir c:\config.sys). The OS/2 command in this case is an incorrect REXX
expression. The program ends with an error.
<P>
A safer way to issue commands is by enclosing the command in quotes, which
makes the command a literal string. REXX doesn't evaluate the contents of
strings. Because the string isn't a REXX instruction or label, REXX passes
the string to OS/2. Here is an example using the PATH command:
<PRE>/* display current path      */
say 'PATH command using REXX'
'path'
</PRE>

<P>
The next example, DP.CMD, shows a program using the DIR and PATH commands.
The PAUSE command is added to wait for the user to press a key before issuing
the next instruction or command. Borders are added too.
<PRE>/* DP.CMD -- Issue DIR and PATH commands to OS/2 */

say '='~copies(40)    /* display line of "="'s   */
                      /* for a border            */

'dir'                 /* display listing of      */
                      /* the current directory   */

'pause'               /* pauses processing and   */
                      /* tells user to "Press    */
                      /* any key to continue."   */

say '='~copies(40)    /* display line of '='     */
'path'                /* display the current     */
                      /* PATH setting            */
</PRE>

<P>
REXX displays the following on the screen when you run the program.
