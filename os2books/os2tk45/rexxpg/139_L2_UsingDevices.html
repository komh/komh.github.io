<H1>Using Devices</H1><!-- entering slot 147 -->
<P>
You can use devices by substituting a device name (such as PRN, LPT1, LPT2,
COM1, and so on) for the file name when you create a stream object. Then
use line or character methods to read or write the device.
<P>
The following example sends data to a printer (device name PRN in the example).
In addition to sending text data, the example also sends a control character
for starting a new page. You can send other control characters or escape
sequences in a similar manner. (Generally, these are listed in the manual
for the device.)
<P>
Usually the control characters are characters that you cannot type at the
keyboard. To use them in your program, send a D2C message to the character's
ASCII value as shown in the example.

pull filename                   /* ...and get it from the user       */
infile=.stream~new(filename)
printer=.stream~new('prn:')

newpage = 12~d2c                  /* save page-eject character         */

/* Repeat this loop until no lines remain in the file */
/* and keep track of the line count with COUNT        */

do count = 1 until filename~lines = 0
   if printer~lineout(infile~linein) &lt;&gt;0 then do
      say 'Error: unable to write to printer'
      leave
   end
   if count // 50 = 0 then                 /* if the line count is a */
      printer~charout(newpage)             /* multiple of 50, then   */
                                           /* start a new page by    */
                                           /* sending the form feed  */

end                               /* go back to the start of loop    */
                                  /* until no lines remain           */

infile~close                      /* close the file                  */
exit                              /* end the program normally        */
