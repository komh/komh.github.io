<H1>What Is Object-Oriented Programming?</H1><!-- entering slot 36 -->
<P>
Object-oriented programming is a way to write computer programs by focusing
not on the instructions and operations a program uses to manipulate data,
but on the data itself. First, the program simulates, or models, objects
in the physical world as closely as possible. Then the objects interact
with each other to bring the desired result.
<P>
It is not unusual for computer data to represent things in the physical
world--a company's employees, money in a bank account, a report. Real-world
objects are stored as data so the computer can<I> act</I> upon it to some
purposeful end. For example, when you "PRINT a report,"<I> PRINT</I> is
the action and<I> report</I> is the object acted upon. Often multiple actions
apply; you could also SEND the report or ERASE the report.
