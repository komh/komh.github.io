<H1>Creating Your Own Classes Using Directives</H1><!-- entering slot 59 -->
<P>
By analyzing your problem in terms of objects, you can determine what classes
need to be created and begin to take advantage of object-oriented technology.
You can create a class using messages or directives. Directives are a new
kind of REXX clause, and they are preferred over messages because the code
is easier to read and understand, especially in large programs. They also
provide an easy way for you to save your class definitions and share them
with others using the PUBLIC option. Because of these advantages, directives
is the technique we will use here.
