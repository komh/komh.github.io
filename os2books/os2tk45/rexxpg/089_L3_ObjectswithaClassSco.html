<H1>Objects with a Class Scope</H1><!-- entering slot 95 -->
<P>
Actually, this encapsulation usually takes place at the class level. The
class is designed as a template of methods and variables--the common "mold"
from which all instances for that class will be stamped. The instances themselves
retain only the values of their variables.
<P>
Within the hierarchy, then, it is the class structure that ensures the integrity
of a class's variables, so that only those methods designed to operate on
them, do. (The class structure also provides for easy updating of the method
code. If a method requires a change, you only have to change it once, at
the class level. The change then is acquired by all the instances sharing
the method.)
<P>
Associated methods and variables are said to have a certain<I> scope,</I> and
in this case, that scope is the<I> class</I> to which they belong. In other
words, the scope of a method and variable group defines or limits the range
of objects that can share that group. Typically, a scope consists of the
methods and object variables confined to a single class.

<P>
Each class in a class hierarchy has a separate scope from every other class.
This is what allows a variable in a subclass to have the same name as a
variable in a superclass, even though the methods that use the variables
may be completely different. But scopes are not confined just to classes.
