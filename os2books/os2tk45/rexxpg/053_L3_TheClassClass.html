<H1>The "Class" Class</H1><!-- entering slot 57 -->
<P>
Within its class hierarchy REXX includes a class for generating new classes,
and this the<I> Class class.</I> If a class is like a factory for producing
<I>instances,</I> Class is like a factory for producing<I> factories.</I> Class
is the parent of every new class in the hierarchy, and these all inherit
Class-like characteristics. The Class-like characteristics take the form
of methods and related variables, which reside in Class, to be used by all
classes.
<P>
A class that can be used to create another class is called a<I> metaclass.
</I>The Class class is unique among REXX classes in that it is the only
metaclass REXX provides (see <A HREF="074_L2_Metaclasses.html">Metaclasses</A>).
As such, Class's methods not only make new classes, they make methods for
use by the new class and its instances. They also make methods that only
the new class itself can use, apart from its instances. These are called
<I>class methods.</I> They give a new class some powers that its instances
are denied.
<P>
Because each instance of Class is another class, or factory, that factory
inherits Class's instance methods as class methods. Think of the instance
methods of the Class factory as<I> factory-running</I> actions. Thus if
Class generates a Pizza factory instance, the factory-running actions (Class's
<I>instance</I> methods) become the<I> class</I> methods of the Pizza factory.
Factory operations are class methods, and any new methods created to manipulate
pizzas would be instance methods:

<P>
As a programmer, you will typically create classes by using<I> directives,
</I>rather than the methods of the Class class. In particular, you'll use
the ::CLASS directive, described later in this section. The ::CLASS directive
is a kind of REXX clause that allows class definitions to be saved permanently,
in a file, where they can be reused by other programs. Creating classes
"on the fly," by using Class methods sent as messages, is not recommended
when permanency or reuse is required. At any rate, directives have class-creating
powers similar to the Class methods.
