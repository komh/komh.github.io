<H1>Objects with Their Own Unique Scope</H1><!-- entering slot 96 -->
<P>
The methods and variables used by instances in a class are usually found
at the class level. But sometimes an instance differs in some way from the
others in its class. It may perform an additional action or require some
unique handling. In this case one or more methods and related variables
can be added directly to the instance. These methods and variables form
a totally separate scope, independent of the more-typical class scopes found
throughout the rest of the hierarchy.
<P>
Methods can be added directly to an instance's collection of object methods
using SETMETHOD, a method of the Object class. All subclasses of the Object
class inherit SETMETHOD. Alternately, the Class class provides an ENHANCED
method that lets you create new instances of a class, whose object methods
are the instance methods of its class, but "enhanced" with additional collection
methods.
