<H1>Changing the Search Order for Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 99 -->
<P>
When composing a message, you can change the default search order for methods
by doing both of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Making the receiver object the sender object.
(You usually do this by specifying the special variable SELF. SELF holds
the value of the object in which a method is running. You can use SELF to
run another method in an object where a method is already running or pass
references about an object to the methods of other objects.)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Specifying a colon and a class symbol after the
message name. The class symbol identifies the class object to use as the
starting point for the search. This class object must be:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->A direct superclass of the class that defines the
active method<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The object's own class, if you used SETMETHOD to
define the active method
<P>
The class symbol is usually the special variable SUPER, but it can be any
environment symbol or variable name whose value is a valid class.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In <A HREF="063_L3_ASampleProgramUsingD.html">A Sample Program Using Directives</A>,
an Account subclass of the Object superclass is created. It defines a TYPE
method for Account, and creates the Savings subclass of Account. The example
defines a TYPE method for the Savings subclass, as follows:
<PRE>::class Savings subclass Account

  ::method 'TYPE'
    return "a savings account"
</PRE>

<P>
To change the search order so REXX searches for TYPE in the Account rather
than Savings subclass, enter this instead:
<PRE>
  ::method 'TYPE'
    return self~type:super '(savings)'
</PRE>

<P>
When you create an asav instance of the Savings subclass and send a TYPE
message to asav:
<PRE>
say asav~type
</PRE>

<P>
REXX displays:
<PRE>
an account
</PRE>

<P>
rather than:
<PRE>
a savings account
</PRE>

<P>
because REXX searches for TYPE in the Account class first.
