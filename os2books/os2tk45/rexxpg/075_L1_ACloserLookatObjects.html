<H1>A Closer Look at Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 79 -->
<P>
Now that you know about classes and how to create them, we'll cover the
mechanics of using objects and methods in more detail. First, here is a
quick refresher.
<P>
We have said that a REXX object consists of:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Actions coded as<I> methods</I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Characteristics, coded as<I> variables,</I> and their
values, sometimes referred to as "state data"<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Sending a message to an object causes it to perform a related action. The
method whose name matches the message performs the action. The message is
the interface to the object, and with<I> information hiding,</I> only methods
that belong to an object can access its variables.
<P>
Objects are grouped hierarchically into<I> classes.</I> The class at the
very top of the hierarchy is the Object class. Everything below it in the
hierarchy belongs to the Object class and is therefore an object. As a result,
all classes are objects.
<P>
In a class hierarchy, classes, superclasses, and subclasses are relative
to one another. Unless designated otherwise, any class directly above a
class in the hierarchy is a superclass. And any class below is a subclass.

<P>
From a class object you can create<I> instances</I> of the class.<I> Instances
</I>are merely similar objects that fit the template of the class; they
belong to the class, but are not classes themselves. Instances are the most
basic, most elemental of objects.
<P>
Both classes and their instances are objects. All objects contain variables
and methods, and so this is true for class objects. The methods a class
provides for use by its various instances are called<I> instance methods.
</I>In effect, these define which messages an instance can respond to. Instance
methods are by far the most common methods in REXX, and here we simply call
them "methods."
<P>
The methods available to the class object itself are called<I> class methods.
</I>(They are actually the instance methods of the Class class.) They define
messages that only the class--and not its instances--can respond to. Class
methods generally exist to<I> create</I> instances and are much less common.
When referring to these rarer methods, we will be sure to identify them
specifically as "class methods." Instancemethodsandclassmethods
