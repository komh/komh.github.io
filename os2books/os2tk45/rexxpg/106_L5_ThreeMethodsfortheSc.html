<H1>Three Methods for the Script Class</H1><!-- entering slot 112 -->
<P>
For the Script class, we provide three methods: INIT, START, and DO. REXX
invokes an INIT method for an object whenever a NEW message is sent to the
class. For our INIT processing, we read the file containing the script into
an array. INIT expects the file identifier as an argument:
<PRE>use arg fileid
</PRE>

<P>
INIT sends a NEW message to the Stream class to get a new stream object:

<PRE>file=.stream~new(fileid)
</PRE>

<P>
The Stream class is useful for file I/O in REXX. To read the file, a MAKEARRAY
message is sent to the stream object:
<PRE>timeline=file~makearray('line')
</PRE>

<P>
MAKEARRAY is a very handy method. When used on a stream object, it reads
an entire file into an array. After reading the file, INIT sends a CLOSE
message to the stream object to close the file.
<P>
INIT uses the EXPOSE instruction to make the Timeline array available to
all other methods in the Script class.
<P>
Next, the START method starts the display of the lines of text. It uses
an EXPOSE instruction to access the Timeline array. For each line in the
script, START creates a message object. This is the tricky part of the program.

<P>
The message object provides for the deferred sending of a message:
<PRE>msg=.message~new(self,'do','I',i)
</PRE>

<P>
The NEW message causes REXX to run the INIT method of the Message class.
The arguments on the NEW message are used by INIT. The first argument on
NEW defines where the message should be sent (SELF). The second argument
is the message to be sent (DO). The third argument indicates that the next
(fourth) argument is an individual string (as opposed to an array). The
fourth and final argument is the argument to be passed on the message. The
message objects that are created contain the information necessary to send
this message:
<PRE>self~do(i)  /* Where "i" is an index to the array of strings */
</PRE>

<P>
SELF is a special variable. Its value is the object that forms the processing
context for the method. In other words, SELF represents the object on which
the method is running. In this case, the method that is running is the START
method. START runs on an instance of the Script class, so SELF represents
the particular instance of the Script class for which START is running.

<P>
SELF might seem abstract, but its use becomes immediately apparent when
you try to write your own methods. Eventually you'll need to send a message
to the object that you are processing. But REXX doesn't pass object handles,
so what do you send the message to? You send it to SELF.
<P>
After creating a message object, START creates an alarm object for the message.
An alarm object sends any message to an object at a given time:
<PRE>.alarm~new(timeline[i]~word(1),msg)
</PRE>

<P>
The NEW message causes REXX to run the INIT method for the newly-created
alarm object. INIT expects a time displacement as its first argument. We
pass it the number of seconds into the song that the line in timeline[i]
is sung. The second argument on INIT is the message object that is to be
processed at that time.
<P>
After creating all the alarm objects, START returns to its caller. Meanwhile,
all the alarm objects are ticking away concurrently, waiting for the correct
moments to send the DO messages to SELF. START ends far before all the alarm
objects are processed.
<P>
The DO method uses EXPOSE to get the Timeline array. DO expects a line number
as an argument. These line numbers were put in the message objects when
they were created. DO displays the line using a SAY instruction.
