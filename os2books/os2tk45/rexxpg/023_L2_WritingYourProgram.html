<P>
You can create REXX programs using any editor that can write straight ASCII
files without hidden format controls. The OS/2 system editor or the Enhanced
Editor are two editors that you can use.
<P>
REXX is a free-format programming language. You can indent lines and insert
blank lines for readability if you wish. But even free-format languages
have some rules about how language elements are used. REXX's rules center
around it's basic language element: the clause.
<P>
Usually, there is one clause on each line of the program, but you can put
several on a line if you wish. Just separate each clause with a semicolon
(;):
<PRE>say "Hello"; say "Goodbye"  /* Two clauses on one line */
</PRE>

<P>
To continue a clause on a second line, put a comma at the end of the line:

<PRE>say,             /* Continuation */
"It isn't so"
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to continue a literal string, do it like this:
<PRE>say,                /* Continuation of literal strings */
"This is a long string that we want to continue",
"on another line."
</PRE>

<P>
You'll notice that we broke the string at a convenient place (where a blank
was expected). REXX automatically adds a blank. If you need to split a string,
but don't want to have a blank inserted when REXX puts the string back together,
use the REXX concatenation operator (||):
<PRE>say 'I do not want REXX to in'||,   /* Continuation with concatenation */
'sert a blank!'
</PRE>
