<H1>More about Stream Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 133 -->
<P>
To use streams in Object REXX, you create new instances of the Stream class.
These "stream objects" represent the various data sources and destinations
available to your program, such as hard disks, CD-ROMs. keyboards, displays,
printers, serial interfaces, networks, and so on.  Because these sources
are represented as objects, you can work with them in similar (but not identical)
ways.
<P>
Stream objects can be "transient" or "persistent."  An example of a transient
(or dynamic) stream object is a serial interface. Data can be sent or received
from serial interfaces, but the data is not "stored" permanently by the
serial interface itself.  Consequently, you cannot, for example, seek to
a position in the data stream. Once you read or write it, the data cannot
be read again.
<P>
A disk file is an example of a persistent stream object.  Because the data
is stored on disk, you can seek forward and backwards in the stream and
read data that you have previously read. REXX maintains separate read and
write pointers to a stream. You can move the pointers independently using
arguments on methods such as LINEIN, LINEOUT, CHARIN, and CHAROUT. REXX
also provides SEEK and POSITION methods for setting the read and write positions.
(We'll discuss read and write positioning in a later section.)
