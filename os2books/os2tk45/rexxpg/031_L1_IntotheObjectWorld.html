<P>
Object REXX includes features typical of an object-oriented language--features
like subclassing, polymorphism, and data encapsulation. As we said at the
outset, Object REXX is an<I> extension</I> of the traditional REXX language,
which has been expanded to include classes, objects, and methods. These
extensions do not replace traditional REXX functions, or preclude the development
or running of traditional REXX programs. You can program as before, program
with objects, or intermix objects with regular REXX instructions.<I> You
</I>decide when to use REXX's object-oriented features. The REXX programming
concepts that support these features are the subject of this section.
