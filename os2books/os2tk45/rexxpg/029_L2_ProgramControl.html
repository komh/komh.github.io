<P>
REXX has instructions such as DO, IF, and SELECT for program control. Here
is a typical REXX IF instruction:
<PRE>if a&gt;1 &amp; b&lt;0 then do
    say "Whoops, A is greater than 1 while B is less than 0!"
    say "I'm ending with a return code of 99."
    exit 99
end
</PRE>

<P>
C programmers will notice that the REXX relational operator for a logical
AND is different from the operator in C (which is &amp;&amp;). Other relational
operators differ as well, so you'll want to review the appropriate section
in the<I> Object REXX Reference</I>. For now, here's a list of some common
comparison operators and operations:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->True if the terms are equal (numerically, when padded,
and so on)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
<LI><LI><LI><LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->True if the terms are not equal (inverse
of =)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<BR>
&gt;<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Greater than<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>&lt;<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Less than<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>&lt;&gt;<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Greater than or less than (same as
not equal)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>&gt;=<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Greater than or equal to<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>&lt;=<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Less than or equal to<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>==<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> True if terms are strictly equal (identical)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>\==, ¬==<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> True if the terms are NOT strictly
equal (inverse of ==)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Throughout the language, the NOT character, ¬, is synonymous
with the backslash (\). You can use the two characters interchangeably,
according to availability and personal preference. The backslash can appear
in the \ (prefix not), \=, and \== operators.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
A character string is taken to have the value false if it is 0, and true
if it is 1. The logical operators take one or two such values (values other
than 0 or 1 are not allowed) and return 0 or 1 as appropriate:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
&amp;<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> AND Returns 1 if both terms are true.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> |
<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>Inclusive OR
<BR>
Returns 1 if either term is true.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &amp;&amp;<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Exclusive
OR
<BR>
Returns 1 if either (but not both) is true.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Prefix
\,¬<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Logical NOT
<BR>
Negates; 1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> On ASCII systems (for example, IBM PS/2 systems), REXX recognizes
the ASCII character encoding 124 as the logical OR character. Depending
on the code page or keyboard you are using for your particular country,
the logical OR character may be shown as a solid vertical bar (|) or a split
vertical bar (▌). The appearance of the character on your screen may not
match the character engraved on the key. If you are receiving error 13,
invalid character in program, on an instruction including a vertical bar
character, make sure this character is ASCII character encoding 124.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
Using the wrong relational or comparison operator is a common mistake when
switching between C and REXX. You'll also notice that the familiar C language
braces { } are not used in REXX for blocks of instructions. Instead, REXX
uses DO/END pairs. The THEN keyword is always required.
<P>
Here is an IF instruction with an ELSE:
<PRE>if a&gt;1 &amp; b&lt;0 then do    say "Whoops, A is greater than 1 while B is less than 0!"
    say "I'm ending with a return code of 99."
    exit 99
end
else do
    say "A and B are okay."
    say "On with the rest of the program."
end  /* if */
</PRE>

<P>
You can omit the DO/END pairs if only one clause follows the THEN or ELSE
keyword:
<PRE>if words(myvar) &gt; 5 then
   say "Variable MYVAR has more than five words."
else
   say "Variable MYVAR has fewer than six words."
</PRE>

<P>
REXX also supports an ELSE IF construction:
<PRE>count=words(myvar)
if count &gt; 5 then
   say "Variable MYVAR has more than five words."
else if count &gt;3 then
   say "Variable MYVAR has more than three, but fewer than six words."
else
   say "Variable MYVAR has fewer than four words."
</PRE>

<P>
The SELECT instruction in REXX is similar to the SELECT CASE<!-- entering slot 31 --> statement
in Basic and the<I> switch</I> statement in C. SELECT executes a block of
statements based on the value of an expression. REXX's SELECT differs from
the equivalent statements in Basic and C in that there isn't an expression
following the SELECT keyword itself. Instead, expressions are placed on
WHEN clauses:
<PRE>select
when name='Bob' then
  say "It's Bob!"
when name='Mary' then
  say "Hello, Mary."
otherwise
end /* select */
</PRE>

<P>
The WHEN clauses are evaluated in order. When one of the expressions is
true, the statement (or block of statements) is executed. All the other
blocks are skipped, even if their WHEN clauses would have evaluated to true.
(C programmers take note: statements like C's<I> break</I> statement are
not needed.)
<P>
Notice that an OTHERWISE keyword is used even though no instructions follow
it. REXX doesn't require an OTHERWISE clause. However, if none of the WHEN
clauses evaluates to true and you omit OTHERWISE, an error occurs. You can
reduce the risk of errors by making a habit of including an OTHERWISE.
<P>
As with the IF instruction, you can use DO/END pairs for multiple clauses
within SELECT cases. You don't need a DO/END pair if multiple clauses follow
the OTHERWISE keyword:
<PRE>select
when name='Bob' then
   say "It's Bob"
when name='Mary' then do
   say "Hello Mary"
   marycount=marycount+1
   end
otherwise
   say "I'm sorry.  I don't know you."
   anonymous=anonymous+1
end /* select */
</PRE>

<P>
Many Basic implementations have several different instructions for loops.
In REXX, there is only the DO/END pair. All of the traditional looping variations
are incorporated into the DO instruction:
<PRE>do i=1 to 10           /* Simple loop            */
   say i
end

do i=1 to 10 by 2      /* Increment count by two */
   say i
end

b=3; a=0             /* DO WHILE -- the conditional expression */
do while a&lt;b         /* is evaluated before the instructions   */
  say a              /* in the loop are executed.  If the      */
  a=a+1              /* expression isn't true at the outset,   */
end                  /* instructions are not executed at all.  */

a=5                  /* DO UNTIL -- like many other languages, */
b=4                  /* a REXX DO UNTIL block is executed at   */
do until a&gt;b         /* least once.  The expression is         */
   say "Until loop"  /* evaluated at the end of the loop.      */
end
</PRE>

<P>
REXX also has a FOREVER keyword. Use the LEAVE, RETURN, or EXIT instructions
to break out of the loop:
<PRE>/* Program to emulate your 5 year old child */
num=random(1,10)  /* To emulate a three year old, move this inside the loop! */
do forever
  say "What number from 1 to 10 am I thinking?"
  pull guess
  if guess=num then do
     say "That's correct"
     leave
  end
  say "No, guess again..."
end
</PRE>

<P>
REXX also includes an ITERATE instruction that's quite handy. It skips the
rest of the instructions in that iteration of the loop:
<PRE>do i=1 to 100
   /* Iterate when the 'special case' value is reached    */
   if i=5 then iterate

   /* Instructions used for all other cases would be here */

end
</PRE>

<P>
You can use loops in IF or SELECT statements:
<PRE>/* Say hello ten times if I is equal to 1 */
if i=1 then
   do j=1 to 10
      say "Hello!"
   end
</PRE>

<P>
Basic programmers may be<!-- entering slot 32 --> wondering if there is
an equivalent to the GOTO statement. There is. You can use a REXX SIGNAL
instruction. SIGNAL causes control to branch to a label:
<PRE>Signal fred;  /* Transfer control to label FRED below */
  ....
  ....
Fred: say 'Hi!'
</PRE>

<P>
As with GOTO, you need to be careful about how you're using SIGNAL. In particular,
you should not try to signal into the middle of a DO/END block or into a
SELECT structure.
