<H1>Activating Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 108 -->
<P>
By default, REXX assumes that an active method requires exclusive use of
its object variable pool. Should another method attempt access at that time,
it is locked out until the first method is done with the variable pool.
This default intra-object concurrency maintains the integrity of the variable
pool and prevents unexpected results. The intra-object concurrency support
is especially useful in coding servers. You don't need to manage queues
for incoming requests that result in messages being sent to the same object.
REXX does it for you.
<P>
Some methods<I> can</I> function concurrently without affecting the variable
pool integrity or yielding unexpected results. When a method does not need
exclusive use of its object variable pool, you can use the SETUNGUARDED
method or the UNGUARDED option of the ::METHOD directive to provide unconditional
intra-object concurrency. These mechanisms control the locking of an object's
scope when a method is invoked.
<P>
Many methods cannot use SETUNGUARDED and UNGUARDED simply because they require
exclusive use of their variable pool some of the time. At other times, they
need to perform some action which will involve the concurrent use of the
same pool by a method on another activity. In this case, you can use the
GUARD instruction. Using the GUARD instruction, when the method reaches
the point in its processing where it requires concurrent use of the variable
pool, it invokes GUARD OFF. GUARD OFF lets another method running on a different
activity become active on the same object. If the method needs to regain
exclusive use, it invokes GUARD ON.
<P>
For even more flexibility when activating methods, you can use GUARD ON/OFF
with the "WHEN<I> expression</I>" option. Add this instruction to the method
code at the point where exclusive use of the variable pool becomes conditional.
When processing reaches this point, REXX evaluates<I> expression</I> to
determine if it is true or false.
<P>
For example, if you specify "GUARD OFF WHEN<I> expression</I>," the issuing
method waits until<I> expression</I> becomes true. To become true, another
method must assign or drop an object variable that is named in<I> expression.
</I>Whenever an object variable changes, REXX reevaluates<I> expression.
</I>If<I> expression</I> becomes true, exclusive use of the variable pool
is released (because GUARD OFF was specified) and the issuing method resumes
with the next instruction.
