<H1>Types of Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 74 -->
<P>
In REXX there are three class types:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Object classes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Abstract classes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Mixin classes<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An<I> object class</I> (the default) can create instance objects in response
to receiving a NEW or ENHANCED message. An<I> abstract class</I> serves
mainly to organize other classes in the hierarchy and define their message
interface, rather than create objects. A<I> mixin class</I>, through multiple
inheritance, can be designated as an additional superclass to a class. The
mixin class typically possesses methods useful to the class that inherits
it, but these must be<I> specifically added</I> because they lie outside
the class's normal line of inheritance.
<P>
The following sections explain these class types in more detail.
