<H1>Queue Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 299 -->
<P>
Application programs can use the REXX Queue Interface to establish and manipulate
named queues. Named queues prevent different REXX programs that are running
in a single session from interfering with each other. Named queues also
allow REXX programs running in different sessions to synchronize execution
and pass data. These queuing services are entirely separate from the OS/2
Inter-Process Communications queues.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> See the<I> Object REXX Reference</I> for more information
about named and unnamed queues.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
