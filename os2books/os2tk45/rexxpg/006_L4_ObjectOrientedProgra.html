<P>
Object-oriented extensions have been added to traditional REXX, but its
existing functions and instructions have not changed. The Object REXX interpreter
is actually an enhanced version of its predecessor, but with new support
for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Classes, objects, and methods<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Messaging and polymorphism<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inheritance and multiple inheritance<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CORBA-compliant access to OS/2 System Object Model
(SOM) objects (CORBA is the Common Object Request Broker Architecture)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Object REXX supplies the user with a base set of classes. These are ALARM,
CLASS, ARRAY, LIST, QUEUE, TABLE, SET, DIRECTORY, RELATION, BAG, MESSAGE,
METHOD, MONITOR, STEM, STREAM, STRING, and SUPPLIER. Object REXX is fully
compatible with earlier versions of REXX that were not object-based.
