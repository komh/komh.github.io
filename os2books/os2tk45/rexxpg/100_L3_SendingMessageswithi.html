<H1>Sending Messages within an Activity</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
REXX makes one exception to sequential processing--when a method sends a
message to itself. Say method M1 has been given exclusive access to object
O, and then tries to run a second,<I> internal</I> method M2, also belonging
to O. Internal method M2 would try to run, but REXX would delay it until
original method M1 finished. Yet M1 would be unable to proceed until M2
ran. The two methods would become deadlocked. In actual practice REXX intervenes
by treating internal method M2 like a subroutine call. In this case, REXX
will run method M2 immediately, then continue processing method M1.
<P>
The mechanism controlling this is the activity. Typically, whenever a message
is invoked on an object, the activity acquires exclusive access by<I> locking
</I>the object's scope. Any other activity sending a message to the object
whose scope is locked must wait until the first activity releases the lock.
The situation is different, however, if the messages originate<I> from the
same activity.</I> When an invocation running on an activity sends<I> another
</I>message to the same object, the method is allowed to run because the
activity has already acquired the lock for the scope. Thus, REXX permits
nested, non-concurrent method invocations on a single activity. No deadlocks
occur because REXX treats these additional messages as subroutine calls.
