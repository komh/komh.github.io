<H1>A Quick Tour of Traditional REXX</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
Because this guide is for OS/2 programmers, we expect you are already familiar
with the programming techniques of at least one other language. To speed
up your involvement with REXX, this section will quickly cover the basic
rules and show you how REXX is like or unlike other languages you may already
know. The idea is to help you assimilate REXX more quickly and make you
productive fast.
<P>
If more detail is what you want, consult the<I> Object REXX Reference</I>.
It contains a full description of the REXX language. You may want to keep
a copy nearby or online to look up any instruction or function not completely
defined here. Think of the<I> Object REXX Reference</I> as a "technical
dictionary for REXX" and this guide as "a get-you-going digest of REXX rules,
key OO concepts, programming approaches, and examples."
