<P>
If you are unsure about whether to employ REXX's object-oriented features,
here are some tips to help you decide.
<P>
Object-oriented technology reinforces sound programming practices: hide
your data from code that doesn't have to use it (encapsulation and polymorphism);
partition your program in small, manageable units (classification and data
abstraction); reuse code wherever possible and change it in one place (inheritance
and functional decomposition), and so on.
<P>
Other advantages often associated with object technology are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Of course, with Object REXX in particular you get REXX usability in an object-oriented
language. You also get access to SOM technologies and frameworks like the
OS/2 Workplace Shell, IBM Multimedia Presentation Manager, the OpenDoc architecture,
and objects written in other SOM-enabled languages.
<P>
If you want to import or use OS/2 SOM objects, import or extensively manipulate
the OS/2 Workplace Shell (manipulations of a subset of objects<I> can</I> be
accomplished procedurally using REXX utilities), script OpenDoc parts, or
create composite applications from REXX-enabled programs, Object REXX is
a good way to go. It's a state-of-the-art scripting language. And OS/2 TCP/IP
now provides an OS/2 Sockets API and an OS/2 FTP API for REXX, so you can
script Object REXX clients and servers, and even run them on the Internet.
If you've been waiting to test the waters of object-oriented programming,
there couldn't be a better time or more accommodating language.
