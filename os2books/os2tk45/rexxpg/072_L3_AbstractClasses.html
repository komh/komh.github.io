<H1>Abstract Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 76 -->
<P>
An<I> abstract class</I> defines methods its subclasses can inherit, but
typically has no instances. Rather, it serves to organize other classes
in the hierarchy. An abstract class can be used to "filter out" a group
of shared methods from a number of subclasses, so they do not have to exist
in two places.
<P>
An abstract class pushes common elements farther up the hierarchy, thus
providing a higher level of organization. By filtering out and moving common
methods upwards, the abstract class refines the message interface for its
subclasses. This lays the groundwork for polymorphism, creating well-defined
interfaces for users of the hierarchy. Abstract classes inherit the instance
methods of the Class class.
<P>
You can create a new abstract class the same way you create an object class.
Just use a simple ::CLASS directive; no options are required. While abstract
classes are not intended for creating instances, REXX does not prevent you
from doing so.
