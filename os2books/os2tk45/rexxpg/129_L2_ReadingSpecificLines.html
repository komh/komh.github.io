<H1>Reading Specific Lines of a Text File</H1><!-- entering slot 136 -->
<P>
You can read a specific line of a text file by entering a line number as
an argument on the LINEIN method. In this example, line 3 is read from CONFIG.SYS:

<PRE>/* Read and display line 3 of CONFIG.SYS */
infile=.stream~new('c:\config.sys')
say infile~linein(3)
</PRE>

<P>
You don't necessarily reduce file I/O by using specific line numbers. Because
text files typically do not have a specific record length, REXX must read
through the file counting line-end characters to find the line you want.
