<H1>Meet Object REXX</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
If you already know how to write conventional programs in a high-level language
like Basic, C, or Pascal, the following information could be for you. Maybe
you are familiar with REXX, maybe not. Maybe you have done some object-oriented
programming and maybe you haven't. But if you want to learn more about object-oriented
(OO) programming using one of the simplest, most powerful, most popular
languages ever made available, you have come to the right place.
