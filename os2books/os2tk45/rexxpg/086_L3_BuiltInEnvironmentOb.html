<H1>Built-In Environment Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
REXX provides some other environment objects all programs can use. To access
these<I> built-in objects,</I> you use the special environment symbols whose
first character is `.'.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>methods<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> The .methods environment symbol identifies
a directory of methods that ::METHOD directives in the currently running
program define. The directory indexes are the method names. The directory
values are the method objects. Only methods that are not preceded by a ::CLASS
directive are in the .methods directory. If there are no such methods, the
.methods symbol has the default value of `.METHODS'. Here's an example:

<PRE>use arg class, methname
class~define(methname,.methods['a'])
::method a
use arg text
say text
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>.rs<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> .rs is set to the return
status from any executed command (including those submitted with the ADDRESS
instruction). The .rs environment symbol has a value of -1 when a command
returns a FAILURE condition, a value of 1 when a command returns an ERROR
condition, and a value of 0 when a command indicates successful completion.
The value of .rs is also available after trapping of the ERROR or FAILURE
condition.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Commands executed manually while tracing interactively do
not change the value of .rs. The initial value of .rs is 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
