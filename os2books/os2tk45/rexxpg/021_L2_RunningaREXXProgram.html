<H1>Running a REXX Program</H1><!-- entering slot 21 -->
<P>
REXX programs on OS/2 should have a file extension of CMD, just like Batch
facility files. Here is a typical REXX program named GREETING.CMD. It prompts
the user to type in a name and then displays a personalized greeting:
<PRE>/* GREETING.CMD -- a REXX program to display a greeting. */
say 'Please enter your name.'    /* Display a message    */
pull name                        /* Read response        */
say 'Hello' name                 /* Display greeting     */
exit 0                   /* Exit with a return code of 0 */
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that the program begins with a comment. In OS/2, the first line of
a REXX program must start with a comment in column 1. If you omit the comment,
OS/2 thinks the program is a Batch facility program, and will try to run
it as such. Naturally, all sorts of errors will result.
<P>
SAY is a REXX instruction that displays a message (like PRINT in Basic or
printf in C). The message to be displayed follows the SAY keyword. The single
quotes are necessary to delimit a character string. In this case, the character
string is<I> Please enter your name</I>. You can use double quotes (") instead
of single quotes if you wish.
<P>
The PULL instruction reads a line of text from the standard input (the keyboard),
and returns the text in the variable specified on the instruction. In our
example, the text is returned in the variable<I> name</I>.
<P>
The next SAY instruction provides a glimpse of what can be done with REXX
strings. It displays the word "Hello" followed by the name of the user,
which is stored in variable<I> name</I>. REXX substitutes the value of<I> name
</I>in the expression and displays the resulting string. You do not need
a separate format string as you do with C or Basic.
<P>
The final instruction, EXIT, ends the REXX program. Control returns to OS/2.
EXIT can also return a value. In our example, zero is returned. The EXIT
instruction is optional.
<P>
You run a REXX program just as you would run a Batch facility program. Type
the file name of the program at an OS/2 command prompt. OS/2 follows its
usual search rules when trying to find the program. That is, OS/2 looks
for the program in the current directory. If OS/2 cannot find the command,
it searches the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
<P>
You can stop a REXX program by pressing the Control (Ctrl)+Break keys. REXX
stops running the program and control returns to OS/2.
