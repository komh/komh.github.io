<H1>Building SOM classes for Use within REXX</H1><!-- entering slot 154 -->
<P>
To build SOM classes for use in REXX, you need to use the SOMobjects Developer
Toolkit, Release 2.1 or later, or the Warp Toolkit. You must build the classes
into a DLL that can be dynamically loaded, and the loading of the DLL should
result in the building of all SOM classes within that DLL. The<I> SOMobjects
Users Guide</I> explains how to do this. It is necessary because REXX calls
the somFindClass on the SOMClassMgrObject to locate the SOM classes on import.
The dllname modifier must be in your IDL file so that SOMClassMgrObject
knows which DLL to load for the class.
<P>
You also need to define the class in the Interface Repository, so that REXX
can get information about the class's methods, method parameters, and return
types.
