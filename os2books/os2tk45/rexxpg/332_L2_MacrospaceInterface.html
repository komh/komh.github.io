<P>
The macrospace can improve the performance of REXX procedures by maintaining
REXX procedure images in memory for immediate load and execution. This is
useful for frequently-used procedures and functions such as editor macros.

<P>
Programs registered in the REXX macrospace are available to all processes.
You can run them by using the RexxStart function or calling them as functions
or subroutines from other REXX procedures.
<P>
Procedures in the macrospace are called the same way other REXX external
functions are called. However, the macrospace REXX procedures can be placed
at the front or at the very end of the external function search order.
<P>
REXX procedures in the macrospace can be saved to a disk file. A saved macrospace
file can be reloaded with a single call to RexxLoadMacroSpace. An application,
such as an editor, can create its own library of frequently-used functions
and load the entire library into memory for fast access. Multiple macrospace
libraries may be created and loaded.
