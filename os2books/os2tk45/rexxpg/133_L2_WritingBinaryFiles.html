<P>
To write a binary file, use CHAROUT. CHAROUT writes only the characters
that you specify in an argument to the method. CHAROUT does not add carriage-return
and line-feed characters to the end of the string. Here is an example:
<PRE>/* JACK.CMD -- demonstrate that CHAROUT does not add new-line characters */
filebin=.stream~new('binary.dat')   /* Create a new stream object       */
filebin~open('replace')             /* Open the file for replacement    */
do i=1 to 50                        /* Write fifty strings              */
  filebin~charout('All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ')
end
filebin~close                  /* Close the file so we can display it   */
'@echo off'                    /* Suppress echo of OS/2 commands        */
'type binary.dat'              /* Use OS/2 TYPE command to display file */
</PRE>

<P>
Because new-line characters are not added, the text displayed by the TYPE
command is concatenated.
<P>
CHAROUT writes the string specified and advances the write pointer. If you
want to position the write pointer before writing the string, specify the
starting position as a second argument:
<PRE>filebin~charout('Jack is loosing it.',30) /* start writing at character 30 */
</PRE>

<P>
In the example, we explicitly open and close the file. If you don't open
the file, REXX attempts to open the file for both reading and writing. If
you don't close the file, REXX closes it when the procedure ends. If you
omit the CLOSE method in the above example, the OS/2 TYPE command won't
type the file. To OS/2, the file doesn't yet exist because it is not yet
closed.
