<H1>Sample REXX Programs</H1><!-- entering slot 379 -->
<P>
The following sample programs are included with REXX as .CMD files. Using
the online version of this guide, you can view these samples from the OS/2
Toolkit REXX Samples directory. To view a sample REXX program, click on
a highlighted program name. The command file will be displayed using the
OS/2 system editor.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
CCREPLY.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> A concurrent programming example.

<P>
This program demonstrates how to use reply to run two methods at the same
time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> COMPLEX.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> A
complex number class.
<P>
This program demonstrates how to create a complex number class using the
::CLASS and ::METHOD directives. An example of subclassing the complex number
class (the Vector subclass) is also shown. Finally, the Stringlike class
demonstrates the use of a mixin to provide some string behavior to the complex
number class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FACTOR.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> A
factorial program.
<P>
This program demonstrates a way to define a factorial class using the subclass
method and the<I> .methods</I> environment symbol.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> GREPLY.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>An example contrasting the GUARDED and UNGUARDED
methods.
<P>
This program demonstrates the difference between GUARDED and UNGUARDED methods
with respect to their use of the object variable pool.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> GUESS.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>An animal guessing game.
<P>
This sample creates a simple node class and uses it to create a logic tree.
The logic tree is filled in by playing a simple guessing game.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> KTGUARD.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>A GUARD instruction example.
<P>
This program demonstrates the use of the START method and the GUARD instruction
to control the running of several programs. In this sample, the programs
are controlled by one 'guarded' variable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MONTH.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>An example that displays the days of the month
for January 1994.
<P>
This program is similar to the MONTH1.CMD exec found in the<I> OS/2 2.0
REXX User's Guide.</I> This version demonstrates the use of arrays to replace
stems.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> PIPE.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> A pipeline
implementation.
<P>
This program demonstrates the use of ::CLASS and ::METHOD directives to
create a simple implementation of a CMS-like pipeline function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> QDATE.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>An example that types/pushes today's date and
moon phase, in English.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> QTIME.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> An
example that lays or stacks time in real English, and also chimes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SEMCLS.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>An Object REXX semaphore class.
<P>
This file implements a semaphore class in Object REXX.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> STACK.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>A stack class.
<P>
This program demonstrates how to implement a stack class using ::CLASS and
::METHOD directives. Also included is a short example of the use of a stack.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>USECOMP.CMD</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> A simple
demonstration of the complex number class.
<P>
This program demonstrates use of the ::REQUIRES directive, using the complex
number class included in the samples.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> USEPIPE.CMD
</A><!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>Sample uses of the pipe implementation in PIPE.CMD.

<P>
This program demonstrates how you could use the pipes implemented in the
pipe sample.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
