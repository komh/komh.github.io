<H1>Metaclasses</H1><!-- entering slot 78 -->
<P>
A<I> metaclass</I> is a class you can use to create another class. REXX
provides just one metaclass, the "Class" class. We've said that a class
is a factory for creating<I> instances,</I> and the "Class" class is a factory
for creating<I> factories.</I> Whenever you create a new factory, or class,
the new class is an instance of Class. The<I> instance</I> methods of Class
provide the operations needed to run the new factories. These instance methods
are inherited by the new factory as its<I> class</I> methods.
<P>
The classes REXX provides do not permit changes or additions to their method
definitions. As a result, all new factories inherit these unchangeable actions
from the "Class" class, and thus operate the same way. So if you want to
create a new class--a new<I> factory</I>--that behaves differently from
the others, you can do one of two things:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Write additional class methods for the new class,
using the ::METHOD directive with the CLASS option<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use a metaclass<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You can always do 1, and most of the time you will only want to do 1. But
if you plan to create many factories with the same operational changes,
you might elect to do 2.
<P>
Any metaclass you create will be a subclass of the Class class. To make
your own metaclass, specify class as a SUBCLASS option in the ::CLASS directive:

<PRE>/* Create a new metaclass  */::class <I>your_metaclass</I> subclass class
</PRE>

<P>
The instance methods of<I> your_metaclass</I> will ultimately become the
class methods for any new class created using<I> your_metaclass.</I> For
example, you could create a metaclass called InstanceCounter that includes
instance methods for tracking how many instances the class creates:
<PRE>/* Create a new metaclass that will count its instances        */
::class InstanceCounter subclass class
  ::method init
   .
   .
   .
</PRE>

<P>
Now, instead of having to add instance-counting class methods to other new
classes you write, you can make InstanceCounter their metaclass. When you
create the new class, just specify InstanceCounter as a METACLASS option
in the ::CLASS directive. If you were creating a Point class, it might look
like this:
<PRE>/* Create a public Point class using the InstanceCounter metaclass  */
::class point public metaclass InstanceCounter
  ::method init
   .
   .
   .
</PRE>

<P>
Instance methods in your new InstanceCounter metaclass will become the class
methods of the Point class, and any other classes you create using a similar
directive. Here is a complete example:
<PRE>/* a metaclass example */

a = .point~new(1,1)                   /* Create point instances       */
say 'Created point instance' a        /* a, b, and c                  */
b = .point~new(2,2)
say 'Created point instance' b
c = .point~new(3,3)
say 'Created point instance' c

                                      /* Ask the Point class how many */
                                      /* instances it has created     */
say 'The point class has created' .point~instances 'instances.'

                                      /* Create a new metaclass that  */
                                      /* will count its instances     */
::class InstanceCounter subclass class
  ::method init                       /* Create an INIT method to     */
    expose instanceCount              /* initialize instanceCount     */
    instanceCount = 0                 /* Forward INIT to superclass   */

    .message~new(self, .array~of('INIT',super), 'a', arg(1,'A'))~send

  ::method new                        /* Create a NEW instance method */
    expose instanceCount              /* Create a new instance        */
    instanceCount = instanceCount + 1 /* Bump the count               */

                                      /* Forward NEW to superclass    */
    return .message~new(self, .array~of('NEW',super), 'a', arg(1,'A'))~send


  ::method instances                  /* Create an INSTANCES method   */
    expose instanceCount              /* Return the instance count    */
    return instanceCount

                                      /* Create Point class using     */
                                      /* InstanceCounter metaclass    */
::class point public metaclass InstanceCounter
  ::method init                       /* Create an INIT method        */
    expose xVal yVal                  /* Set object variables         */
    use arg xVal, yVal                /* as passed on NEW             */

  ::method string                     /* Create a STRING method       */
    expose xVal yVal                  /* Use object variables         */
    return '('xVal','yVal')'          /* to return string value       */
</PRE>
