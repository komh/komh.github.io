<P>
An object class is like a factory for producing instances. An object class
creates instances and provides methods that these instances can use. At
the time of its creation, an instance acquires all instance methods of the
class it belongs to. If a class adds new methods later, existing instances
do not acquire them. Instances created after the new methods do acquire
them.
<P>
Because classes define methods for their instances, and methods define the
variables instances use, object classes are a complete blueprint for creating
REXX instances. The Array class is an example of an object class.
