<H1>Modularizing Data</H1><!-- entering slot 37 -->
<P>
In conventional, structured programming, actions like PRINT are often isolated
from the data by placing them in subroutines or modules. A module typically
contains an operation for implementing one simple action. You might have
a PRINT module, a SEND module, an ERASE module. These actions are independent
of the data they operate on.

But with object-oriented programming, it is the data that is modularized.
And each data module includes<I> its own</I> operations for performing actions
directly related to its data.

In the case of<I> report,</I> the<I> report</I> object would contain its
own built-in PRINT, SEND, ERASE, and FILE operations.
<P>
Object-oriented programming lets you model real-world objects--potentially
very complex ones--precisely and elegantly. As a result, object manipulation
becomes easier within the computer's programming. Computer instructions
become simpler, and can be modified later with minimal effort.
<P>
Object-oriented programming<I> hides</I> any information that need not be
known in order to act on an object, thereby concealing the object's complexities.
Complex tasks can then be initiated simply, at a very high level. It's like
moving your arm. To do so, you do not have to know about the many electrical,
chemical, and mechanical interactions that must occur in the bones, muscles,
tissues, and systems involved. These operations occur at lower levels. You
just<I> move your arm.</I>
