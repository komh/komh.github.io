<H1>Creating Classes Using Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 69 -->
<P>
We mentioned that you can create a class using messages as well as directives.
Though classes are available only to the program that creates them, there
are occasions when this is useful and public availability is not required.
Hence we demonstrate the message technique here, using the Savings Account
example we showed using directives.
