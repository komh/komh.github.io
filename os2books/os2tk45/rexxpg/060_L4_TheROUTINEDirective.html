<H1>The ::ROUTINE Directive</H1><!-- entering slot 64 -->
<P>
Use the ::ROUTINE directive to create a named routine within a program.
The ::ROUTINE directive starts the named routine and another directive (or
the end of the program) ends the routine.
<P>
The ::ROUTINE directive is useful for defining lower-level routines that
are called by several methods. These methods might be in unrelated classes
or in different applications. Use ::ROUTINE when you have some useful utility
that you don't want to surface as a method.
<P>
The ::ROUTINE directive includes a PUBLIC option for making the routine
available to programs outside its containing REXX program, and the outside
program must reference the routine by using a ::REQUIRES directive.
<P>
Only one ::ROUTINE directive can appear for any routine name within a program.
