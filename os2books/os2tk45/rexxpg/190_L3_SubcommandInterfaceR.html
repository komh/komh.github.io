                                   name registered in another process,
                                   or a DLL handler with the same name
                                   registered in another DLL.  (To
                                   address this subcommand you must
                                   specify its library name.)

                                   RexxRegisterSubcomDll); the
                                   subroutine environment is not
                                   registered (other REXX subcommand
                                   functions).

                                   a dynalink library; most commonly, a
                                   missing dynalink library file causes
                                   the error.
