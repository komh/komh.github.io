<H1>Initializing Instances Using INIT</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
Recall that object classes are those that can create instance objects. When
these instances require initialization, you'll want to define an INIT method
to set a particular starting value or initiate some startup processing.
REXX will look for an INIT method whenever a new object is created; if INIT
is there, REXX runs it.
<P>
The purpose of initialization is to ensure that the variable is set correctly
before using it in an operation. If an INIT method is defined, REXX runs
it after creating the instance. Any initialization arguments specified on
the NEW or ENHANCED message are passed to the INIT method, which may use
them to set the initial state of object variables.
<P>
If an instance has more than one INIT method (for example, INIT is defined
in multiple classes), each INIT method must forward the INIT message up
the hierarchy and run the topmost version of INIT, to properly initialize
the instance. An example in the next section demonstrates use of INIT.
