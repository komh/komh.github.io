<H1>How the "Play and Display" File Works</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
Now let's take a look at how CDNOTES uses the classes. CDNOTES reads a script
file as input. The script file contains lines of text and the amount of
time (in seconds) that must pass before each line is displayed. For our
example, we used "Digging in the Dirt" from Peter Gabriel's "Us" CD. We
determined the times for each line by playing back the CD using OS/2's CD
player, and jotting down the displayed time when each line started.
<P>
CDNOTES also has a ::REQUIRES directive for the OREXXMM.CMD, which contains
the class definitions for Multimedia and Script.
<P>
CDNOTES accepts one argument: a number of a track on the CD to play. It
uses the track number as an extension for the file identifier. Thus GABRIEL.7
(for track 7) is used as the file name in the sample.
<P>
After retrieving the command line argument, CDNOTES creates a multimedia
script by sending a NEW message to the Script class:
<PRE>script=.script~new('gabriel.'||track)  /* Create script      */
</PRE>

<P>
The name of the file containing the script is passed as an argument on the
NEW message.
<P>
Next CDNOTES creates an instance of the Multimedia class. The NEW message
invokes the INIT method of the Multimedia class. The INIT method expects
to be passed the type of multimedia object being opened. In our case, it
is CDAUDIO:
<PRE>cd=.multimedia~new('cdaudio')    /* Create CDAUDIO object  */
</PRE>

<P>
The next few lines of code determine where the end of the track is. The
SET and STATUS messages cause REXX to run the UNKNOWN method of the Multimedia
class. The UNKNOWN method builds the appropriate MCI string command.
<PRE>cd~set('time format milliseconds')          /* Set the time format  */
startloc=cd~status('position track' track)   /* Set start point      */
if track=cd~status('number of tracks') then  /* Last track?          */
   endloc=''                                 /* Set stop point...    */
else
   endloc='to' cd~status('position track' track+1)
</PRE>

<P>
Now CDNOTES becomes a bit more interesting. To play the CD, we use the START
method of the Object class:
<PRE>done=cd~start('play','from' startloc endloc 'wait')
</PRE>

<P>
The START method sends a message, which is specified in the arguments, to
the CD object. The first argument on the START message is the message to
be sent. The second argument on START are the arguments for the message
being sent. In this case, the message is PLAY, and the argument that is
passed on the PLAY method is the result of the expression:
<PRE>'from' startloc endloc 'wait'
</PRE>

<P>
The START method sends the message and then immediately returns control
to CDNOTES. The PLAY message causes the UNKNOWN method to be processed.
UNKNOWN builds an MCI PLAY instruction to start the CD. We didn't send the
PLAY message directly to the CD object because control wouldn't return to
the CDNOTES program until the CD track finished playing--we wouldn't be
able to synchronize the display of the text.
<P>
After starting the CD, CDNOTES starts the synchronized text display by sending
the START message to the script object:
<PRE>script~start
</PRE>

<P>
START creates message objects and alarm objects for every line in the song,
and returns control immediately to CDNOTES. START is an example of polymorphism.
In the Object class, START sends a message and returns immediately. In the
Script class, START creates message and alarm objects, and returns immediately.
Since the functions are similar, they have the same name.
<P>
Notice that we don't account for processing delays that may occur in creating
the alarm objects or in starting the audio playback. Consequently, the synchronization
won't be perfect. In a real<!-- entering slot 115 --> application, you might
want to adjust the timings in the script file or add an adjustment factor
when creating the alarm objects.
<P>
START doesn't wait for the alarm objects to process before returning to
its caller. Consequently, START returns to CDNOTES well before the CD track
has completed playback. The next line of code closes the CD:
<PRE>cd~close
</PRE>

<P>
So if the CD is still playing, why doesn't CLOSE stop it prematurely? CLOSE
causes REXX to run the UNKNOWN method. The UNKNOWN method runs on the same
object (CD) using the same object variables that are in use because of the
PLAY method. REXX senses that another method is using the object variable,
and blocks the CLOSE until PLAY completes. (You can check this by placing
SAY instructions around the line containing the CLOSE.)
<P>
After closing the CD, CDNOTES frees multimedia resources by sending the
FREE message to the Multimedia class. FREE is a class method.
<P>
As this brief sample shows, REXX's object-oriented features greatly extend
what you can do with the language. And they do so while maintaining the
simplicity and brevity of the traditional REXX. CDNOTES uses objects, concurrent
programming, and multimedia to create a simple computer karaoke in about
70 lines of code.
