<H1>REXX Application Programming Interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 162 -->
<P>
This appendix describes how to interface applications to REXX or extend
the REXX language by using REXX application programming interfaces (APIs).
As used here, the term<I> application</I> refers to programs written in
languages other than REXX. Commonly this is the C language. Conventions
in this appendix are based on the C language. Refer to a C programming reference
manual if you need a better understanding of these conventions.
<P>
The features described here let an application extend many parts of the
REXX language or extend an application with REXX. This includes creating
handlers for subcommands, external functions, and system exits.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Subcommands<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> are commands issued from a REXX program.
A REXX expression is evaluated and the result is passed as a command to
the currently "addressed" subcommand handler. Subcommands are used in REXX
programs running as application macros.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Functions
<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>are direct extensions of the REXX language. An application
can create functions that extend the native REXX function set. Functions
may be general- purpose extensions or specific to an application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> System
exits<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> are programmer-defined variations of the operating
system. The application programmer can tailor the REXX interpreter behavior
by replacing REXX system requests.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Subcommand, function, and system exit handlers have similar coding, compilation,
and packaging characteristics.
<P>
In addition, applications can manipulate the variables in REXX programs
(see <A HREF="277_L2_VariablePoolInterfac.html">Variable Pool Interface</A>),
and execute REXX routines directly from memory (see <A HREF="332_L2_MacrospaceInterface.html">Macrospace
Interface</A>).
