<H1>Using Variables to Build Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 121 -->
<P>
You can use variables to build commands, just as you would use variables
to construct any string. The SHOFIL.CMD program below is an example. SHOFIL
types a file that the user specifies. It prompts the user to enter a file
name and then builds a variable to hold the TYPE command and the input file
name.
<P>
To have REXX issue the command to the operating system, put the variable
holding the command string on a line by itself. REXX evaluates the variable
and passes the resultant string to OS/2:
<PRE>/* SHOFIL.CMD -- build command with variables */

/* prompt the user for a file name            */
say "Type a file name:"

/* assign the response to variable FILENAME   */
pull filename

/* build a command string by concatenation    */
commandstr = "TYPE" filename

/* Assuming the user typed "demo.txt,"        */
/* the variable COMMANDSTR contains           */
/* the string "TYPE DEMO.TXT" and so...       */

commandstr           /* ...REXX passes the    */
                     /* string on to OS/2     */
</PRE>

<P>
REXX displays the following on the screen when you run the program.
<PRE>[C:\]shofil
Type a file name:
demo.txt

This is a sample text file. Its sole
purpose is to demonstrate how
commands can be issued from REXX
programs.
