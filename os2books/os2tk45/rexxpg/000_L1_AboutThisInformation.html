<H1>About This Information</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
The<I> Object REXX Programming Guide</I> describes the Object-based REstructured
eXtended eXecutor, or Object REXX programming language. (When not comparing
it to its traditional predecessor, we just call it REXX.) REXX is an integral
part of IBM Operating System/2 (OS/2).
<P>
This information is aimed at developers familiar with OS/2 who want to use
REXX to do object-oriented programming--or some mix of traditional and object-oriented
programming--with the shortest learning curve possible.
<P>
This information assumes you are already familiar with the techniques of
traditional structured programming, and uses them as a springboard for quickly
understanding REXX and, in particular, Object REXX. This "no frills" approach
is designed to help experienced programmers get involved quickly with the
REXX language, exploit its virtues, and become productive fast.
