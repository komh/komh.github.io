<P>
The instructions to set a trap for errors are SIGNAL and CALL. Example formats
are:
<PRE>SIGNAL ON <I>condition</I> NAME <I>trapname</I>
CALL   ON <I>condition</I> NAME <I>trapname</I>
</PRE>

<P>
The SIGNAL ON instruction initiates an exit subroutine that ends the program.
The CALL ON instruction initiates a subroutine that returns processing to
the clause immediately following the CALL ON instruction. Use CALL ON when
you want to<I> recover</I> from a command error or failure.
<P>
The two command conditions that can be trapped are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
ERROR<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL> Detects<I> any</I> nonzero error code the
default environment issues as the result of a REXX command<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FAILURE
<!-- lm: 0x12 5 -->
<UL>Detects a severe error, preventing the system from
processing the command<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A failure, in this sense, is a particular category of error. If you use
SIGNAL ON or CALL ON to set a trap only for ERROR conditions, then it traps
failures as well as other errors. If you also specify a FAILURE condition,
then the ERROR trap ignores failures.
<P>
With both the SIGNAL and CALL instructions, you have the option of specifying
the name of the trap routine. Add a NAME keyword followed by the name of
the subroutine. If you don't specify the name of the trap routine, REXX
uses the value of<I> condition</I> as the name (REXX looks for the label
ERROR:, FAILURE:, and so on).
<P>
For more information about other conditions that can be trapped, see the
<I>Object REXX Reference.</I>
