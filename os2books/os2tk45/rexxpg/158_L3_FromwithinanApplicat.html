<P>
The REXX interpreter is an dynamic link library (DLL) routine. Any application
can call the REXX interpreter to run a REXX program. The interpreter is
fully re-entrant and supports REXX procedures running on multiple threads
within the same process.
<P>
A C-language prototype for calling REXX is in the REXXSAA.H include file.
