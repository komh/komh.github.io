<H1>Full Inter-Object Concurrency</H1><!-- entering slot 103 -->
<P>
Inter-object concurrency, where objects in a program are actively running
methods at the same time, is provided for by REXX in two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Early reply, by means of the REPLY instruction<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Message objects<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<I>Early reply</I> allows the object sending a message to keep on processing
after the message is sent. Meanwhile, the receiving object runs the method
corresponding to the message. This method contains the REPLY instruction,
which returns any results to the sender, interrupting the sender just long
enough to reply. The sender and receiver continue operating simultaneously.

<P>
Alternatively, an independent<I> message object</I> can be created and sent
to a receiver. One difference in this approach is that any reply returned
does not interrupt the sender. It waits until the sender asks for it. In
addition, message objects can simply notify the sender about the completion
of the method it sent, and even specify synchronous<I> or</I> asynchronous
method activation.
<P>
The chains of execution represented by the sender method and the receiver
method are called<I> activities</I>. An activity is a thread of execution
that can run methods concurrently with methods on other activities. In other
words, activities can run at the same time.
<P>
An activity contains a stack of<I> invocations</I> that represent the REXX
programs running on the activity. An invocation can be:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A main program invocation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An
internal function or subroutine call<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An external function or subroutine call<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An INTERPRET instruction<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A message invocation<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An invocation is pushed onto an activity when an executable unit is invoked.
An invocation is removed (or<I> popped</I>) when execution completes.
