<H1>Public versus Private Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 100 -->
<P>
A method can be public or private. Any object can send a message that runs
a<I> public</I> method. Only a message an object sends to itself (using
the special variable SELF as the message receiver) can run a<I> private
</I>method. Private methods include methods at different scopes within the
same object. (This lets superclasses make methods available to their subclasses
while hiding those methods from clients of the object.) A private method
is like an internal subroutine. It shields the internal workings of an object.
