<P>
Use the NEW method to define an instance of the new class, and then call
methods that the instance inherited from its superclass. To define an instance
of the Savings class named "John Smith," and send John Smith the TYPE and
NAME= messages to call the related methods, enter:
<PRE>newaccount = savings~new
say asav~type
asav~name = 'John Smith'
</PRE>
