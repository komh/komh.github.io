<H1>The ::REQUIRES Directive</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
Use the ::REQUIRES directive when a program needs access to the classes
and objects of another program,<I> program_name.</I> This directive takes
the form:
<PRE>::REQUIRES <I>program_name</I>
</PRE>

<P>
The ::REQUIRES directive must precede all other directives, and the order
of the ::REQUIRES directives determines the search order for the classes
and routines defined in the named programs.
<P>
REXX uses local routine definitions within a program over routines of the
same name accessed through ::REQUIRES directives. Local class definitions
within a program override classes of the same name in other programs accessed
through ::REQUIRES directives. Another directive (or the end of the program)
must follow a ::REQUIRES directive.
<P>
