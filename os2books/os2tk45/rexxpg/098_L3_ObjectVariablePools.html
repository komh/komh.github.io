<H1>Object Variable Pools</H1><!-- entering slot 104 -->
<P>
Every object has its own set of variables, called its<I> object variable
pool.</I> These are variables associated solely with the object--rather
than with any one method belonging to the object. When an object's method
runs, the first thing it does is identify the object variables it intends
to work with. Technically, it "exposes" these variables, using the REXX
instruction EXPOSE. Exposing the object's variables distinguishes them from
variables used by the method itself, which are not exposed. Every method
an object owns--that is, all the<I> instance methods</I>in the object's
class--can expose variables from the object's variable pool.
<P>
Therefore, an object variable pool includes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Variables exposed by methods in the object's class
(call these variables a<I> sub</I>pool)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Variables inherited from classes elsewhere in the
hierarchy (in the form of additional subpools)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Recall that all of a class's variables, together with the methods that expose
them, are called a<I> class scope.</I> REXX exploits this idea of class
scope to achieve concurrency. To explain, the object variable pool is really
a collection of variable subpools. Each subpool is at a different scope
in the object's inheritance chain. As long as the methods running on the
object are at different scopes, they can run simultaneously.
<P>
Let's amplify this point further. Scopes, like objects, hide and protect
data from outside manipulation. Methods at the same scope share the variable
subpools at that scope. The scope shields the variable subpools from methods
operating at other scopes. This lets you reuse variable names from class
to class, without fear the variables could be accessed and possibly corrupted
by a method outside their own class. So class scopes effectively partition
an object's variable pool into subpools that can operate independently of
one another. Multiple methods can use the same variable pool concurrently,
as long as they confine themselves to variables in their own subpools.
