<H1>The Object Class</H1><!-- entering slot 56 -->
<P>
Because the topmost class in the hierarchy is the<I> Object class,</I> everything
below it is an object. Objects, to interact with each other, require their
own actions, called methods. Those methods that encode actions needed by
<I>all</I> objects belong to the Object class.
<P>
As methods of the top class, every other class in the hierarchy inherits
them. For now, think of<I> inheritance</I> as the handing down of methods
from a "parent" class--called a<I> superclass</I>--to all of its "descendent"
classes--called<I> subclasses.</I> Finally, instances<I> acquire</I> methods
from their classes. The Object class, then, is the topmost, or root class,
of the class hierarchy. Any method created for the Object class is made
available to every other class in the hierarchy. From the programmer's standpoint,
this happens automatically; it is handled by the REXX language itself.
