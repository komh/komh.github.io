<H1>Programming for Intra-Object Concurrency</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
You've read that multiple methods can access the same object at the same
time only if they are operating at different scopes. That is because they
are working with separate variable subpools. If two methods in the same
scope try to run on the object, REXX by default processes them on a "first-in,
first-out" basis, while treating internal methods as subroutines. You can,
however, achieve full intra-object concurrency. REXX offers several mechanisms
for this, including:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The SETUNGUARDED method of the Method class and the
UNGUARDED option of the ::METHOD directive, which provide unconditional
intra-object concurrency.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The GUARD OFF and GUARD ON instructions, which permit
switching between intra-object and default concurrency<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When intra-object concurrency at the scope level is needed, you must specifically
employ these mechanisms (see the following section). Otherwise, REXX will
sequentially process the methods when they are competing for the same object
variables.
