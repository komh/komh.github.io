<H1>The ::METHOD Directive</H1><!-- entering slot 63 -->
<P>
After writing a ::CLASS directive, use a ::METHOD directive to create a
method for that class and define the method's attributes. The next directive
in the program, or the end of the program, will end the method.
<P>
Some classes you define will have an INIT method. INIT is called whenever
a NEW message is sent to a class. The INIT method should contain whatever
code is needed to initialize the object.
<P>
While it is not required that a ::METHOD directive be preceded by a ::CLASS
directive, without it the method is only accessible to the executable part
of the program through REXX's .METHODS environment symbol. This symbol identifies
a directory of methods that you can refer to by name. Only one method directive
can appear for any method name not associated with a class.
<P>
As with the ::CLASS directive, the ::METHOD directive has a number of useful
options; in this case they are used for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating a<I> class</I> method for the most-recent
::CLASS directive (the CLASS option)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating a<I> private</I> method; that is, a method
that works like a subroutine and can only be activated by the object it
belongs to--otherwise the method is public by default, and any sender can
activate it (the PRIVATE option)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating a method that can be called while other methods
are active on the same object, as described in <A HREF="102_L3_ActivatingMethods.html">Activating
Methods</A> (the UNGUARDED option)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating a pair of instance methods,<I> method_name
</I>and<I> method_name</I>=, for the preceding ::CLASS directive (the ATTRIBUTE
option)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
