<H1>Workplace Shell Example:  Creating Folders</H1><!-- entering slot 160 -->
<P>
Here is a simple example showing how to create a folder and add objects
to it:
<PRE>/* Add the workplace constants to the global environment         */
call wpconst

/* Create a new folder with title 'My Folder' on the desktop     */
newfolder = .wpfolder~new('My Folder','',.wpdesktop,1)
</PRE>

<P>
You may have to rearrange your windows a little bit to make the new folder's
icon visible.
<PRE>/* Send a message to the new folder object and show the result   */
say newfolder~wpquerytitle

/* Change the title of the new folder                            */
newfolder~wpsettitle('My Excellent Folder')

/* Add a program object to the new folder                        */
.wpprogram~new('REXXTRY','EXENAME=pmrexx.exe;PARAMETERS=REXXTRY',newfolder,1)

/* Open the new folder and make it current                       */
newfolder~~wpopen(0,.wpconst['OPEN_DEFAULT'],0)~wpswitchto(0)
</PRE>

<P>
Now double click the REXXTRY icon to verify that the program was added correctly
and works as expected.
<PRE>/* All done, close the folder                                    */
newfolder~wpclose
</PRE>

<P>
