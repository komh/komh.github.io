<P>
If you don't explicitly close a file, REXX closes the file for you at the
end of the procedure (that is, the end of the CMD file in which the files
were opened). If your procedure is being called as an external procedure
by some other REXX program, REXX will close the files before returning to
the caller. In any case, it's a good idea to explicitly close files when
you are done with them.
