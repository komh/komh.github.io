<P>
Because the Workplace Shell objects are implemented using SOM, REXX provides
very powerful and flexible direct access to the shell objects, but accessing
the shell objects directly requires programmers to have considerably more
knowledge of how the Workplace Shell works. In addition, programming Workplace
Shell objects always involves some risk of damaging the shell in a way that
might require re-installation of OS/2.
<P>
As with other SOM classes, the REXX documentation does not include documentation
for the workplace classes and methods. These are documented in the OS/2
Technical Library, and the documentation for the methods is in the form
of C-language function calls. Before trying any object-oriented REXX programming
of the Workplace Shell, you should read this reference material. REXX provides
interfaces to the objects, but cannot enforce correct Workplace Shell programming.

<P>
Do not use any Workplace Shell methods containing INOUT or OUT parameters
(for example, wpQueryProgDetails).
<P>
Some Workplace Shell objects by default cannot be deleted. You may want
to issue a wpSetup method to the new object and to make it able to be deleted:

<PRE>wpShredder = .wps~import('WPShredder')
xshred = wpShredder~new('myShred','',<I>folder</I>,1)
xshred~wpsetup('NODELETE=NO')
</PRE>

<P>
REXX currently does not support complex Workplace Shell parameters; it supports
only string, integer, or boolean. (For example, it cannot support PPROGDETAILS.)

<P>
REXX Workplace Shell initialization adds a hidden object, OrxInit, to your
desktop. This is a WPZORXINIT object. You will notice this only if you query
the contents of the desktop folder.
