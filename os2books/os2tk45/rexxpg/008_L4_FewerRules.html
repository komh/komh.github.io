<P>
REXX has relatively few rules about format. A single instruction can span
many lines, and you can include multiple instructions on a single line.
Instructions need not begin in a particular column and you can type them
in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. You can skip spaces in a line or
entire lines. There is no line numbering.
