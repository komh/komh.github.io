<P>
Traditional REXX multimedia support provides limited capabilities for synchronizing
multimedia events. Although you can use REXX to start a multimedia object,
REXX is not notified when the processing is complete. This makes multimedia
synchronization an ideal candidate for exploiting concurrency in object-oriented
REXX. This sample also uses .alarm and .message environment symbols from
the directory of public objects mentioned in the previous section.
