<H1>The Default Search Order for Selecting a Method</H1><!-- entering slot 98 -->
<P>
When a message is sent to an object, REXX looks for a method whose name
exactly matches the message string. If the message is ADD, for example,
REXX looks for a method named ADD. Because, in the class hierarchy, there
may be more than one method with the same name, REXX begins its search by
going first to the object specified in the message. If the sought method
is not found there, the search continues up the hierarchy. In order, REXX
searches for:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A method the object itself defines (with SETMETHOD
or ENHANCED)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A method the object's class defines
<P>
An object acquires the methods of its parent class; that is, the class for
which the object was created. If the class subsequently receives new methods,
objects predating the new methods<I> do not</I> acquire them.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A method an object's superclasses define
<P>
As with the object's class, only methods that existed in the superclass
when the object was created are valid. REXX searches the superclass method
definitions in the order that INHERIT messages were sent to an object's
class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If REXX doesn't find a match for the message name, REXX checks the object
for method name UNKNOWN. If it exists, REXX calls the UNKNOWN method, and
returns as the message result any result the UNKNOWN method returns. The
UNKNOWN method arguments are the original message name and a REXX array
containing the original message arguments (see <A HREF="095_L3_DefininganUNKNOWNMet.html">Defining
an UNKNOWN Method</A>). If the object doesn't have an UNKNOWN method, REXX
raises a NOMETHOD condition. Any trapped information can then be inspected
using REXX's CONDITION built-in function.
<P>
REXX searches<I> up</I> the hierarchy so that methods existing higher can
be supplemented or overridden by methods existing lower. Searchingthehierarchyforamethod

<P>
For example, suppose you wrote a program that allows users to look up other
users' phone numbers. Your program includes a class called Phone_Directory,
and all its instances are users' names with phone numbers. You have included
a method in Phone_Directory called NOTIFY that reports some data to a file
whenever someone looks up a number. All instances of Phone_Directory use
the NOTIFY method.
<P>
Now you decide you want NOTIFY, in addition to its normal handling, to personally
inform you whenever anyone looks up<I> your</I> number. To accommodate this
special case for your name only, you create your own NOTIFY method that
adds the new task and replicates the file handling task. You save the new
method as part of your own name instance, retaining the same name, NOTIFY.

<P>
Now, when a NOTIFY message is sent to your name instance, the new version
of NOTIFY will be found first. REXX will look no further up the class hierarchy.
The instance-level version will<I> override</I> the version at the class
level. This technique of overriding lets you change a method used by one
instance without disturbing the common method used by all the other instances.
It is very powerful for that reason.
<P>
