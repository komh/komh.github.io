<P>
Anyone interested in getting a basic understanding of object-oriented concepts
should read this information. Using this information, experienced programmers
can learn about the REXX language and how it is like and unlike other structured
programming languages. Programmers who want to broaden their programming
knowledge can learn object-oriented programming with REXX. Users already
experienced with REXX can learn about object-oriented programming (OO) in
general, and OO programming with REXX in particular.
<P>
Programmers who want to make their applications (typically coded in C) scriptable
by REXX, extend the REXX language, or control REXX scripts from other applications
should consult the application programming interface (API) information in
the appendixes presented here. For those who want to control REXX from<I> OS/2
</I>applications, additional information on the OSA Scripting Components
API is available in the<I> OSA Guide and Reference.</I>
