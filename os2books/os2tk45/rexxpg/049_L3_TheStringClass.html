<H1>The String Class</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
<I>Strings</I> are data values that can have any length and contain any
characters. The ability to manipulate strings in multiple ways is just as
useful as the ability to manipulate I/O streams. There is the need to compare
strings: is one string equal to, greater than, or less than another?
<P>
Strings are subject to logical operations like AND, OR, exclusive OR, and
logical NOT. We need to concatenate and copy strings, reverse them, join
them together and split them apart. When strings are numeric, there is the
need to perform arithmetic operations on them or find their absolute value
or convert them from binary to hex, and vice versa. All this and more can
be accomplished using the<I> String class</I> of objects.
