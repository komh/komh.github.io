<H1>Data Abstraction</H1><!-- entering slot 43 -->
<P>
The ability to create new, high-level data types and organize them into
a meaningful class structure is called<I> data abstraction.</I> Data abstraction
is at the heart of object-oriented programming. Once you model objects with
real-world properties from the basic data types, you can continue creating,
assembling, and combining them into more and more complex objects at will.
Then you can use these objects as if they were part of the original programming
language. You can do most of your coding in a high-level, real-world context
(roll the ball, reverse the pen), instead of the typical low-level, built-in
data-type format (using numbers, characters, and symbols) of conventional
programming.
