<H1>The Environment Object (.environment)</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->The Environment object is a directory of public
objects that are always accessible. To place something in the Environment
directory, use the form:
<PRE>.environment~<I>your.object</I> = <I>value</I>
</PRE>

<P>
Include a period (.) in any object name you use, to avoid conflicts with
current or future REXX entries to the Environment directory. To retrieve
your object, use the form:
<PRE>say .environment~<I>your.object</I>
</PRE>

<P>
To give your object definition limited retrievability, place it in .local,
where the scope is the current process only.
<P>
Use an<I> environment symbol</I> to access the entries of this directory.
An environment symbol starts with a period and has at least one other character,
and its second character cannot be a digit. You have seen environment symbols
earlier; for example in:
<PRE>asav = .savings~new
</PRE>

<P>
.Savings is an environment symbol, and refers to the Savings class. The
classes you create can be referenced with an environment symbol, and there
is an environment symbol for each REXX-defined class, as well as for each
of the unique objects this section describes, such as the NIL object.
<P>
