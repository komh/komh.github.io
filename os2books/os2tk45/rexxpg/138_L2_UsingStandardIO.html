<H1>Using Standard I/O</H1><!-- entering slot 146 -->
<P>
All of the preceding topics dealt with reading and writing files. You can
use the same methods to read from standard input (usually the keyboard)
and to write to standard output (usually the display). You can also use
the methods to write to the standard error stream. In Object REXX, these
default streams are represented by public objects of the Monitor class:
.input, .output, and .error.
<P>
The streams STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are transient streams. For transient
streams, you cannot use any method or method argument for positioning the
read and write pointers. (You can't, for example, use the SEEK method on
STDOUT.)
<P>
Writing to STDOUT has the same effect as using the SAY instruction. However,
the SAY instruction always writes line-end characters at the end of the
string. By using the CHAROUT method to write to STDOUT, you can control
when line-end characters are written.
<P>
The following example shows a modified COUNT program. COUNT was introduced
earlier in this section. We've modified COUNT to display a progress indicator.
For every line processed, COUNT now uses CHAROUT to display a single period.
COUNT doesn't write any line-end characters, so the periods wrap to the
next line when they reach the end of the line in the OS/2 window.
<PRE>/* COUNT counts the words in a file                    */
parse arg path                    /* Get the file name */
count=0                                 /* Initialize the count */
file=.stream~new(path)     /* Create a stream object for the input file */
do while file~lines&lt;&gt;0        /* Process each line of the file */
   text=file~linein           /* Read a line                   */
   count=count+(text~words)   /* Count blank-delimited tokens  */
   .output~charout('.')       /* Write period to STDOUT        */
end
say ''
say count
</PRE>

<P>
Reading from STDIN using LINEIN is similar to reading with the PARSE PULL
instruction:
<PRE>/* INEXAM.CMD -- example of reading STDIN with LINEIN */

/* Prompt for input with SAY and PARSE instructions   */
say 'What is your name?'
parse pull response
say 'Hi' response
say ''

/* Now prompt using LINEOUT and LINEIN                */
.output~lineout('What is your name?')
response=.input~linein
.output~lineout('Hi' response)
</PRE>

<P>
Using character methods with STDIN and STDOUT gives you more control over
the reading and writing of line-end characters. In the following example,
the prompting string is written to STDOUT using CHAROUT. Because CHAROUT
doesn't add any line-end characters to the stream, the display cursor is
positioned after the prompt string on the same line.
<PRE>/* INCHAR.CMD -- example of reading STDIN with CHARIN */
.output~charout('What is your name? ')
response=.input~charin(,10)
.output~charout('Hi' response)
</PRE>

<P>
CHARIN is used to read the user's response. The user's keystrokes are not
returned to your program until the user presses the Enter key. In the example,
a length of 10 is specified. If fewer characters than the specified length
are available, CHARIN waits until they become available. Otherwise, the
characters are returned to your program. As usual, CHARIN does not strip
any carriage-return or line-feed characters before returning the string
to your program. You can observe this with INCHAR by typing several strings
that are fewer than ten characters and pressing Enter after each string:

<PRE>[C:\]inchar
What is your name? John
Q.
Public
Hi John
Q.
Pu
</PRE>
