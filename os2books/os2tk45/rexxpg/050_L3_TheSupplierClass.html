<H1>The Supplier Class</H1><!-- entering slot 54 -->
<P>
Some collections have suppliers: a bakery, for example, may supply certain
breads, cookies, cakes and pies; a financial report may supply certain data,
statistics, tables, and reports. The <I> Supplier class</I> is used to enumerate
items that a collection contained at the time of the supplier's creation.
For example, this class contains methods to verify if an item is available
from a supplier (Does the Pie-by-Night Bakery sell chocolate cake?). Another
method returns the index of the current item in a collection (What is the
position of the<I> apple pie</I> record?). Others return the current collection
item in a collection object, and the next item in the collection.
