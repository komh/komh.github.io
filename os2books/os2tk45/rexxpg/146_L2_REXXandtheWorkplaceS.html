<H1>REXX and the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 155 -->
<P>
If you are an OS/2 user, you are familiar with the Workplace Shell. The
shell provides many objects, including folders, programs, and special-purpose
objects such as the shredder. You can manipulate objects with actions such
as double-click and dragging and dropping one object on another. These actions
send messages to the shell objects. For example, double-click sends a "wpopen"
message. Objects respond to these messages by running methods that perform
the requested actions. The class of the object receiving the message determines
the method used for each action; therefore, opening a folder does something
different than opening a program.
