<P>
The REXX macrospace is placed in shared memory. Only the amount of memory
and swap space available to the system limits the size of the macrospace.
However, as the macrospace grows, it limits the memory available to other
processes in the system. Allowing the macrospace to grow too large may degrade
overall system performance due to increased system swap file access. Try
to place only the most frequently-used functions in the macrospace.
