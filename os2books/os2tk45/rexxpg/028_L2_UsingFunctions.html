<P>
REXX functions can be used in any expression. In this example, the built-in
function WORD is used to return the third blank-delimited word in a string:

<PRE>/* Example of function use                                     */
myname="John Q. Public"   /* assign a literal string to MYNAME */
surname=word(myname,3)    /* assign WORD result to SURNAME     */
say surname               /* display surname                   */
</PRE>

<P>
Literal strings can be supplied as arguments to functions, so the above
program can be rewritten as follows:
<PRE>/* Example of function use                                            */
surname=word("John Q. Public",3) /* assign WORD result to SURNAME     */
say surname                      /* display surname                   */
</PRE>

<P>
Since an expression can be used on the SAY instruction, you can further
reduce the program to:
<PRE>/* Example of function use                                            */
say word("John Q. Public",3)
</PRE>

<P>
Functions can be nested. Suppose you wanted to display only the first two
letters of the third word, Public. The LEFT function can return the first
two letters, but you need to give it the third word. LEFT expects the input
string as its first argument and the number of characters to return as its
second argument:
<PRE>/* Example of function use               */

/* Here is how to do it without nesting  */
thirdword=word("John Q. Public",3)
say left(thirdword,2)

/* And here is how to do it with nesting */
say left(word("John Q. Public",3),2)
</PRE>

<P>
