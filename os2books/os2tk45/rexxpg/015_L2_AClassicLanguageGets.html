<P>
Object-oriented extensions have been added to traditional REXX without changing
its existing functions and instructions. So you can continue to use REXX's
procedural instructions, and incorporate objects as you become more comfortable
with the technology. In general, your current REXX programs will work without
change. But because Object REXX catches more errors at translate time than
traditional REXX, you may have to fix these.
<P>
In object-oriented technology,<I> objects</I> are used in programs to model
the real world. Similar objects are grouped into<I> classes</I>, and the
classes themselves are arranged in hierarchies.
<P>
As an object-oriented programmer, you solve problems by identifying and
classifying objects related to the problem. Then you determine what actions
or behaviors will be required of those objects. Finally, you write the instructions
to generate the classes, create the objects, and implement the actions.
Your main program consists of instructions that send messages to objects.

<P>
A billing application, for example, might have an Invoice class and a Receipt
class. These two classes might be members of a Forms class. Individual invoices
are objects that are<I> instances</I> of the Invoice class.

Objects in a billing application
<BR>

<BR>
                Forms class
<BR>
                   │
<BR>
           ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
<BR>
           │                │
<BR>
        Invoice class          Receipt class
<BR>

<BR>
        invoice #1343
<BR>
        invoice #1344
<BR>
        invoice #1345
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
Each instance contains all the data associated with it (such as customer
name, descriptions and prices of items purchased, and so on). To get at
the data, you write instructions that send<I> messages</I> to the objects.
These messages activate coded actions called<I> methods</I>. For an invoice
object, you might want CREATE, DISPLAY, PRINT, UPDATE, and ERASE methods.
