<P>
The<I> mixin class</I> lets you optionally add a set of instance and class
methods to one or more other classes using inheritance. You use mixins,
therefore, to extend the scope of a class beyond the usual lines of inheritance
defined by the hierarchy. Think of it as widening a class's inheritance
to accept methods from a sibling or cousin, as well as a parent. When a
class inherits from more than just its parent superclass, we call this<I> multiple
inheritance.</I>
<P>
You can add mixin methods to a class by using the INHERIT option on the
::CLASS directive. The class to be inherited must be a mixin class. During
class creation and multiple inheritance, subclasses inherit both class and
instance methods from their superclasses.
<P>
A mixin's first non-mixin superclass is its<I> base class.</I> Any subclass
of a mixin's base class can directly or indirectly inherit a mixin; other
classes cannot.
<P>
To create a new mixin class, use the ::CLASS directive with the MIXINCLASS
option. A mixin class is also an object class and so can create its own
instances.
