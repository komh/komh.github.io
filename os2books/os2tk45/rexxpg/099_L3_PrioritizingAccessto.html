<H1>Prioritizing Access to Variables</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
Even with class scopes and subpool partitioning, a variable is still vulnerable
if multiple methods within the scope try to access it at the same time.
To handle this, REXX rules that once a particular method is activated and
exposes variables from its subpool, that method has exclusive use of the
subpool until processing is through. Until then, REXX delays running any
other method needing the same subpool.
<P>
Thus, within a single scope, if different activities send multiple messages
to the same object, REXX forces the methods to run sequentially. This "first-in,
first-out" processing of methods in a scope prevents them from simultaneously
accessing any one variable, and maybe corrupting the data.
