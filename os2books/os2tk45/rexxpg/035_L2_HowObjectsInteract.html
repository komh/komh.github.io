<H1>How Objects Interact</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
You have seen that the actions within an object are its only interface to
other objects. Actions form a kind of "wall" that encapsulates the object,
and shields its internal information from outside objects. This shielding
is called<I> information hiding.</I> Information hiding protects an object's
data from corruption by outside objects, and also protects outside objects
from relying on another object's private data, which may change without
warning. Because an object's actions are its only interface to the outside,
one object can act upon another (or cause it to act) only by calling that
object's actions. How do they do it? They send<I> messages.</I>
<P>
<I>OO programming in REXX, then, consists of sending messages to objects.
</I>
<P>
Objects respond to these messages by performing an action, returning some
data, or both. A message to an object must specify:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A receiving object<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The "message send" symbol (~), sometimes called the
"twiddle"<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The action and, optionally in parentheses, any parameters
it needs to perform its function<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
So the message format looks like this:
<PRE><I>object~action(parameters)</I></PRE>

<P>
Say the object is the string !iH. Sending it a message to use its REVERSE
action:
<PRE>'!iH'~reverse
</PRE>

<P>
returns the string object Hi!.
