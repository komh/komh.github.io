<H1>Issuing a Command to Call a .CMD File</H1><!-- entering slot 120 -->
<P>
If you are issuing a command to have OS/2 run one of its built-in commands
or other programs, you can call it by name as previous examples showed.
However, to have OS/2 run another .CMD program from your REXX program, you
must call it using a CALL instruction instead of calling it by name. There
are two kinds of calls you can use:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The REXX CALL instruction<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OS/2 CALL command<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The REXX CALL instruction calls other REXX programs. To call a REXX program
named MYSUB1, you could write the CALL instruction:
<PRE>call mysub1</PRE>

<P>
REXX recognizes the CALL instruction, handles the call, and processes MYSUB1
as a REXX program.
<P>
The REXX CALL instruction does not work to call a non-REXX .CMD file. Instead,
you would use the OS/2 CALL command. To call a non-REXX .CMD program named
MYSUB2, you could write the CALL instruction like this:
<PRE>"call mysub2"
</PRE>

<P>
REXX evaluates the expression and passes it to the OS/2 command handler
for processing. The command handler recognizes the CALL command and processes
MYSUB2 as a .CMD program.
<P>
The quotation marks around call mysub2 indicate that this is the OS/2 CALL
command instead of a REXX CALL instruction.
