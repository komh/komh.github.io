<H1>Trapping Command Errors</H1><!-- entering slot 126 -->
<P>
The most efficient way to detect errors from commands is by creating<I> condition
traps,</I> using the SIGNAL ON and CALL ON instructions, with either the
ERROR or the FAILURE condition. When used in a program, these instructions
enable, or switch on, a detector in REXX that tests the result of every
command. Then, if a command signals an error, REXX stops usual program processing,
searches the program for the appropriate label (ERROR:, or FAILURE:, or
a label that you created), and resumes processing there.
<P>
SIGNAL ON and CALL ON also tell REXX to store the line number (in the REXX
program) of the command instruction that triggered the condition. REXX assigns
that line number to the special variable SIGL. Your program can get even
more information about what caused the command error through the built-in
function CONDITION.
<P>
Using the SIGNAL and CALL instructions to handle errors has several advantages;
namely, programs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Are easier to read because you can confine error-trapping
to a single, common routine<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Are more flexible because they can respond to errors
by clause (SIGL), by return code (RC), or by other information (CONDITION
method or built-in function)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Can catch problems and react to them before the environment
issues an error message<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Are easier to correct because you can turn the traps
on and off (SIGNAL OFF and CALL OFF)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For other conditions that may be detected using SIGNAL ON and CALL ON, see
the<I> Object REXX Reference.</I>
