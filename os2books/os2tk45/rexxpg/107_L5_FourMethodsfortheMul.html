<H1>Four Methods for the Multimedia Class</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
For playing the CD, we use the REXX multimedia support currently supplied
with OS/2. We want to "wrap" the support with REXX methods so that we can
take advantage of REXX concurrency support.
<P>
The wrapping involves four methods: INIT, UNKNOWN, MCIRXSENDSTRING, and
FREE. The INIT method initializes the REXX multimedia support and opens
whatever device is passed to it. CDNOTES will pass `cdaudio' to it so that
the audio CD device is opened.
<P>
FREE is a class method. We'll use it at the end of CDNOTES to free the multimedia
resources.
<P>
The most interesting method is UNKNOWN. UNKNOWN is like an "otherwise" clause
for a class. If you send an object a message and there isn't a method by
that name, the UNKNOWN method is invoked.
<P>
In the CDNOTES "play and display" file, we'll be using the MCI string verbs
STATUS, SET, PLAY, and CLOSE for the CD. The MCI string command format for
those verbs is symmetrical: verb, followed by items, followed by 'WAIT'
(required for REXX). We haven't defined these verbs as methods of our Multimedia
class. So if we send these verbs as messages to an instance of our Multimedia
class, the UNKNOWN method will be invoked.
<P>
When REXX invokes the UNKNOWN method, it passes the name of the method as
the first argument, and any arguments that were specified as the second
argument. This second argument is an array of arguments. Our UNKNOWN method
builds an MCI command string from the arguments and then uses the MCIRXSENDSTRING
method to process the string.
<P>
The MCIRXSENDSTRING method calls the mciRxSendString function and returns
RETSTR to the caller.
<P>
