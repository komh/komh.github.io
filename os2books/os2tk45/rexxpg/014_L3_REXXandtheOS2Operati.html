<H1>REXX and the OS/2 Operating System</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
The most vital role REXX plays is as a programming language for OS/2. A
REXX program can serve as a script for the OS/2 operating system to follow.
Using REXX, you can reduce long, complex, or repetitious tasks to a single
command or program.
<P>
REXX is a built-in feature of OS/2, so programs are run directly from a
windowed or full-screen command prompt. There is no installation process
or separate environment. You can run a REXX program anywhere that you can
use an OS/2 command or batch file.
