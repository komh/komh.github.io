<P>
In object-oriented programming, as in the real world, objects interact with
each other. This interaction does not usually happen in isolation. Picture,
for example, throngs of people interacting at rush hour in the business
district of a big city. A program that aspires to simulate the real world
would have to enable many objects to interact at any given time. That could
mean thousands of objects sending messages to each other, thousands of methods
running at once. In REXX, this simultaneous activity is called<I> concurrency.
</I>To be precise, the concurrency is<I> object-based</I> concurrency because
it involves objects, as opposed to, say, processes or threads.
<P>
REXX objects are inherently concurrent, and this concurrency takes two forms:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Inter-object concurrency,</I> where multiple objects
are active--exchanging messages, synchronizing, running their methods--at
the same time<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Intra-object concurrency,</I> where multiple methods
are able to run on the same object at the same time<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Default settings in REXX allow full inter-object concurrency but limited
intra-object concurrency. Some situations will make it desirable to use
special REXX instructions, routines, or classes to make full intra-object
concurrency happen. First, let's look at what is automatic.
