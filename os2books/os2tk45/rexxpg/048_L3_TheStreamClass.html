<H1>The Stream Class</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->
<P>
Input and output streams let REXX communicate with external objects--people,
files, queues, serial interfaces, displays, networks, and the like. In programming
there are many useful stream actions that could be coded as methods for
manipulating the various stream objects. These methods and objects are organized
in the<I> Stream class.</I>
<P>
The methods are used to open streams for reading or writing, close streams
at the end of an operation, move the line-read or line-write position within,
say, a file stream, or get information about a stream. Methods are also
provided to get character strings from a stream or send them to a stream,
count characters in a stream, flush buffered data to a stream, query path
specifications, time stamps, size, and other information from a stream,
or do any other I/O stream manipulation one might find necessary or useful
(see <A HREF="125_L1_InputandOutput.html">Input and Output</A> for examples).
