:p.
The Workplace Shell Object Styler is a sample Workplace Shell SOM
application which demonstrates the basic functionality of a Workplace
Shell SOM application.
The application allows a user to change and save the basic style
attributes of any object that is dropped on it.

:note.
Use this application with care, deselecting all of the items
(especially the Drag) will prevent you from using WPSTYLER again
in order to reinstate the styles.

:p.
:hp2.Title Bar Text:ehp2.
:p.
You can modify the title bar text of the object from the Workplace
Shell Styler in addition to changing the object style.
Changing the title text here has the same effect as changing it
from the General page of the object itself.
