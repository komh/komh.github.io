<P>
The conversion from a .CSC file to an .IDL file is handled by the CTOI program.
For example, to convert the file MYDOG.CSC to an IDL file, make sure all
the CSC, SC, and PSC files referenced by MYDOG.CSC are accessible, and then
invoke the program as shown in the following command line:
<PRE>ctoi mydog.csc
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Converting a Workplace Shell application from a CSC file to
an IDL file requires the SC files from the previous OS/2 Toolkit installed
on your system (in the SC directory), and all the ones that you might have
created. The IDL subdirectory from the OS/2 Toolkit contains the IDL files
for the public Workplace Shell classes and objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
In this example, the CTOI program produces a file called MYDOG.IDL containing
the definitions in IDL format. In many cases, you should be able to compile,
install and run your application without further modification. However,
the following situations will require manual intervention:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any classes that use IDL reserved words as functions
or variable names need to be changed. For example, "string", "context",
"interface".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The SOM compiler no longer generates .SC, .PSC, or
.PH files. Installation and make files that refer to .CSC, .SC, .PSC, or
.PH files need to be changed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The data declaration changes. Public and private instance
variables are converted to attributes. However, structures and arrays require
manual changes, as shown in the following figure:
<PRE><B>OIDL</B>                           <B>IDL</B>

data:
  struct info infoBuffer;      interface: ...   {
                                  typedef struct info info;
                                  ...
                               implementation {
                                  info infoBuffer;
                                  ...
                                  };

data:
  char achMyArray[20];         interface: ...   {
                                  typedef char myarraytype[20];
                                  ...
                               implementation {
                                  attribute myarraytype achMyArray;
                                  ...
                                  };

data:
  unsigned char chFlag;        attribute octet chFlag;

data:
  char    *argv[];             char   **argv;

</PRE>

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->IDL does not permit structures to be passed by value.
Instead, methods must pass a pointer to a structure. Methods can return
a structure, and if a method does so, it should have the modifier<I> struct
</I>attached to it, as shown in the following figure:
<PRE>AStructure resolveMyIdentity(in string pszIdent), struct;
</PRE>

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OIDL private qualifier has been removed. Private
instance data and methods must now be enclosed in a special #ifdef directive,
as shown in the following figure:
<PRE><B>OIDL</B>                             <B>IDL</B>

int x, private;                  #ifdef __PRIVATE__
                                    int x;
VOID mymethod(), private;           VOID mymethod();
                                 #endif
</PRE>

<P>
To include private data and methods in the processing of an IDL file, the
SOM compiler should be invoked with either the -P option or the -D_PRIVATE_
option, as shown in the following command lines:
<PRE>sc -p yourname.idl

sc -d__PRIVATE__ yourname.idl
</PRE>

<P>
Note that there are two underscore ( __ ) characters before and after the
word PRIVATE.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Passthru statement processing has changed. Passthru
statements should only be used to pass #include directives to the language
binding files. In addition:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Information can no longer be directed to the implementation
(.C) file<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Most information directed to implementation Header
(.IH) files should be moved to the implementation (.C) file<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Forward
<!-- entering slot 298 -->references are required in IDL. Thus, classes
and objects must be declared before being referenced. The following figure
shows an example to forward reference the M_Cat class:
<PRE>interface M_Cat;
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Because IDL is strongly typed (unlike OIDL), data structures and constants
should be declared before referencing them, in order to eliminate unnecessary
warning messages during compilation. This is required if an interface repository
(.IR) file is to be created from the IDL file.
