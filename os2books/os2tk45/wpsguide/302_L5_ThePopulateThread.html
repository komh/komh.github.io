<BR>
The<I> Populate thread</I> is created when a folder is opened. It is from
this thread that _wpPopulate is invoked. wpPopulate is responsible for finding
and instantiating from their persistent state all objects that reside in
a particular folder. Because this is very I/O intensive, this is handled
asynchronously. The Populate thread is responsible for sending messages
to the container instructing it to add new records representing the newly
instantiated objects.
