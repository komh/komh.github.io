<H1>About Workplace Shell Processes and Threads</H1><!-- entering slot 311 -->
<P>
The<I> Workplace process</I> is the one under which all the Workplace Shell
classes are loaded and initialized. Therefore, objects representing Workplace
Shell classes and their subclasses must run on this process. The Workplace
process is actually launched from the<I> Shell process</I>, which is the
process indicated in the SET PROTSHELL= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Once the Shell process is running, it starts the Workplace process. It is
the Shell process that is responsible for restarting the Workplace process
in the event that it is ended as a result of a trap. The PROTSHELL= statement
in the CONFIG.SYS file indicates which process is to be launched as the
Shell process. The SET RUNWORKPLACE= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file indicates
which process is to be the Workplace process. In the default configuration,
both the PROTSHELL and RUNWORKPLACE environment variables are set to PMSHELL.EXE.
PMSHELL.EXE is designed to distinguish between being started as the Shell
process versus being started as the Workplace process. The following diagram
illustrates the initialization sequence:
