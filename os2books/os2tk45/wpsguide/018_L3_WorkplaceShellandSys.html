<P>
SOM is the object technology used for the implementation of the Workplace
Shell. It provides a language neutral, object-oriented programming methodology
that you can use to create Workplace Shell objects and bind them to the
Workplace Shell. This chapter describes SOM's architecture, its features
and environment. It describes its methods, classes, and finally provides
an example of its workings. This chapter is not intended to be a SOM programming
guide. It is, however, intended to serve as an introduction to SOM at a
level necessary to write Workplace Shell applications.
