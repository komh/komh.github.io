<H1>About Error Handling Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 126 -->
<P>
The WPObject class provides methods which can be overridden to design your
own error handling system.
<P>
The wpQueryError method obtains the error identity that was set on an object
by the last call to wpSetError. The wpQueryError method can be called at
any time.
<P>
The wpSetError method sets the error identity on an object. Typically, this
method is called prior to returning from a method that is unsuccessful.
The wpQueryError method is then called to identify the error.
<P>
Similar to object errors, class errors can also be queried and set using
wpclsQueryError and wpclsSetError.
<P>
The wpclsQueryError method obtains the error identity that was set on a
class object by the last call to wpclsSetError. The wpclsQueryError method
can be called at any time.
<P>
The wpclsSetError method sets the error identity on a class object. Typically,
this method is called prior to returning from a class method that is unsuccessful.
The wpclsQueryError method is then called to identify the error.
