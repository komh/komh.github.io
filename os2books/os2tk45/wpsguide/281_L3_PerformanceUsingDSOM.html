<H1>Performance Using DSOM</H1><!-- entering slot 302 -->
<P>
In a distributed environment, a designer needs to keep in mind the possible
performance impacts, because IPC communications is always slower than procedure
calls within the same process. Writing a normal Workplace Shell application
that runs within the Workplace Shell's process always perform better than
an application in another process using DSOM.
