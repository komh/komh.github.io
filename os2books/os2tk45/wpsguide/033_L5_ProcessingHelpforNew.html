<P>
When a class defines new items for its pop-up menu, it also must provide
for the processing of the help for these items when the user requests it.
This is accomplished by overriding wpMenuItemHelpSelected inherited from
WPObject. Given the item selected by the user, the method override for wpMenuItemHelpSelected
calls wpDisplayHelp inherited from WPObject to display the Help dialog window
for that item. The wpDisplayHelp method requires the ID for the help panel
associated with the item, as well as the name of the help library where
it resides.

<P>
The implementation of the CAR object also demonstrates the use of:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A release order list in CAR.IDL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->External stem and prefix attributes in the class section
of CAR.IDL. This allows the debugging process to be easier, because method
names are externalized.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message queue for the Workplace Shell. Object code
runs on the Workplace Shell's thread. Windows associated with objects receive
messages through the Workplace Shell's message queue. Objects do not need
their own message queues.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
