<H1>Direct Manipulation on Workplace Shell Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 188 -->
<P>
Common objects are provided by the Workplace Shell for use in applications.
When an icon is dragged over a Workplace Shell object, the target object
sends a message to the source container to enable a direct manipulation
exchange. The message explains what the target object does. Completion of
a drop requires that the source and target objects share a common rendering
mechanism. If the source object is not appropriate for a drop on the target
and the drop is prohibited, a "do-not" symbol is shown. Workplace Shell
handles standard Presentation Manager rendering mechanisms, as well as its
own mechanisms, to allow easy integration of Presentation Manager applications.

<P>
Workplace Shell simplifies implementation of a direct manipulation operation,
handling the filling of data structures, the drag sequence, and notification
of the target when a successful drop occurs. The standard direct manipulation
capabilities of the Workplace Shell include<B> Print</B>,<B> Delete</B> and
<B>File Move/Copy</B>.
