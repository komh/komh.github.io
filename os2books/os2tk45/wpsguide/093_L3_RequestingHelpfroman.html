<H1>Requesting Help from an Application Window</H1><!-- entering slot 99 -->
<P>
When a user requests help from an application window by pressing the F1
key, the wpclsQueryDefaultHelp method should be overridden, as shown in
the following figure:
<PRE>wpclsQueryDefaultHelp(M_MYOBJECT *somSelf,
                      PULONG pHelpPanelId,
                      PSZ HelpLibrary)

where
       pHelpPanelId  - Pointer to the help panel ID
       HelpLibrary   - Help library name returned in the buffer

</PRE>

<P>
This method is called to allow the class object to specify its default help
panel for its instances. This class method is called during the default
processing of wpQueryDefaultHelp. It can be called at any time in order
to determine the default help panel for the object class. The WPObject class
does not process this method other than returning FALSE. Derived classes
can override this method to provide the default help panel ID and help module
name for their object instances. All classes should override this method
to tell the system what help they want displayed when the user selects the
F1 key. In this case, also, the value of ID_HELP_DEFAULT should be the same
as the resid for the default help for MYOBJECT class in the IPF file. The
three following sample codes show how to override wpclsQueryDefaultHelp.
They present the class interface definition (IDL), source code (C), and
make (MAK) files, respectively.
<PRE>passthru: C.ih;
    .
    .
  #define ID_HELP_DEFAULT  256
    .
    .

endpassthru;

//# Class modifiers
    .
    .
wpclsQueryDefaultHelp: override;
    .
    .

</PRE>

<P>
The following sample code shows the source code of MYOBJECT when overriding
wpclsQueryDefaultHelp:
<PRE>/*
 *  METHOD: wpclsQueryDefaultHelp
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *    Process input from the help submenu item that was added.
 */
SOM_Scope BOOL SOMLINK myobjM_wpclsQueryDefaultHelp(M_MYOBJECT *somSelf,
                                                    PULONG pHelpPanelId,
                                                    PSZ pszHelpLibrary)

{
  /* M_MYOBJECTData *somThis = M_MYOBJECTGetData(somSelf); */
  M_MYOBJECTMethodDebug("M_MYOBJECT","myobjM_wpclsQueryDefaultHelp");

  if (pHelpPanelId)    /* Set the default help panel ID */
    *pHelpPanelId = ID_HELP_DEFAULT;

  if (pszHelpLibrary)  /* Copy the help file name */
    strcpy(pszHelpLibrary, szHelpLibrary);

  return (TRUE);
}

</PRE>

<P>
The help library can be created by using the IPFC compiler. The following
figure shows the make file of MYOBJECT:
<PRE>myobject.hlp:  $$(@B).ipf
               ipfc $*.ipf
