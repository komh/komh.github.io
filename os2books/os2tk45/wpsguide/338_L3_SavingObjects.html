<P>
The following sample code shows how to save the state of an object asynchronously:

<PRE>#define INCL_WINWORKPLACE
#include "os2.h"

HOBJECT  Object;
BOOL     fAsync = TRUE;
BOOL     fSuccess

hObject = WinQueryObject("&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;");
if (hObject != NULL)
{
  /* WinQueryObject was successful */
  fSuccess = WinSaveObject(hObject,fAsync);

  if (fSuccess)
  {
    /* The state of the Desktop was saved asynchronously */
  }
  else
  {
    /* Asynchronous save of the Desktop failed */
  }
}

</PRE>
