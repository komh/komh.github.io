<P>
The wpOpen method is called to open a view of this object. The<I> ulView
</I>parameter tells the object whether to open the Settings view, Contents
view, or Help view (and so on), and<I> param</I> is an optional parameter.
Note that both parameters can be zero, in which case the default view of
the object is opened. This instance method is invoked when a user either
double clicks on the object or selects the<B> Settings</B> item from the
pop-up menu. When wpOpen is called as a result of the user selecting the
<B>Open</B> item or clicking on the object, WPStyler will display a usage
message box. OPEN_STYLER is returned as the default view to the<B> Open
</B>item, because wpQueryDefaultView is subclasses and the Styler's ID is
returned as the default view.
