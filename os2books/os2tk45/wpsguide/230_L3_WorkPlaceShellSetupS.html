<P>
The setup strings are used to specify custom attributes for creating Workplace
Shell objects. The keynames can be concatenated together in some cases for
defining the object. The INI.RC file that is located in the OS/2 subdirectory
contain all of the Workplace Shell install objects. These objects are comprised
of the title, class_name, setup string, and object ID. The keynames in the
setup string might have to be set to values such as ON, OFF, YES, or NO.
Every class may define its own set of keynames and values. The<I> Workplace
Shell Reference</I> contains the definition of keynames for all classes.
All keynames for WPObject class are listed in <A HREF="152_L3_WorkplaceShellSetupS.html">Workplace
Shell Setup Strings</A>.
