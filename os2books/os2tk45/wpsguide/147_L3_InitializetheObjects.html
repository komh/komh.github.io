<P>
The wpInitData method is called from WPObject's override of somDefaultInit
immediately after the memory for the object has been allocated. The allocated
memory is zero filled. If the zero initialization is not adequate for the
object instance data for your class, override this method and set the instance
variable values appropriately. The wpInitData method is called whenever
the object is instantiated, whether it be during initial object creation
or awakening it from dormancy. In the latter case, wpRestoreState is invoked
after wpInitData.
