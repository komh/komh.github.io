<P>
The wpSetupOnce method is called during initial object creation following
wpInitData and the creation of the persistent image. It is not called when
an object is awakened from dormancy. The primary purpose of wpSetupOnce
is to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call wpSetup to set the object characteristics and
behaviors based on the setup string input to WinCreateObject.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Perform non-setup string initialization that cannot
be done during the wpInitData processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The non-setup string initialization may have been deferred because it required
existence of the persistent image or because it was data other than instance
data that required initialization. Override wpSetupOnce only if your class
has non-setup string initialization to perform because WPObject wpSetupOnce
calls wpSetup. Override wpSetup if your object class has defined unique
setup string keywords or keyword values.
<P>
The wpSetup method is also invoked as a result of WinSetObjectData being
called on an existing object. The wpScanSetupString method exists as a helper
routine for parsing values from the setup string.
