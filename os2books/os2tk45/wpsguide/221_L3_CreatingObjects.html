                         &lt;setup_string&gt;,

and one of the class WPProgram. The program object MyProgram is inserted
into the Folder MyFolder. The location specified by MyProgram is the same
as the object ID for MyFolder.

call RxFuncAdd "SysLoadFuncs", "rexxutil", "SysLoadFuncs"

say SysCreateObject("WPFolder",,
                    "MyFolder",,
                    "&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;",,
                    "OBJECTID=&lt;Prefix_MyFolder&gt;")
