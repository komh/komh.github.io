<H1>Views of Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 338 -->
<P>
The user also can interact with an object by opening a window that displays
more information about the object. The content of a window is a<I> view
</I>of an object. A view is a way of looking at an object's information.
Different views display information in different forms, just as information
about an object is presented in the real world. An object can have more
than one view.
<P>
The appearance of a window's contents and the kinds of interaction possible
in a window are determined, in part, by the type of view presented in the
window. CUA guidelines describe four basic types of views:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Composed Views
<P>
A<I> Composed view</I> of a data object arranges the object's data in an
order that conveys the data's meaning. If the data is arranged differently
in a Composed view, the object has a different meaning. For example, a graph
or chart object typically is displayed in a Composed view because the arrangement
of the components determines the meaning of the object as a whole. If the
arrangement of the components changes, the meaning of the object changes.

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Contents Views
<P>
A<I> Contents view</I> lists the components of an object. The components
can be ordered or unordered in the view;  the order of the information displayed
in a Contents view does not affect the meaning of the object containing
the information. CUA guidelines describe two kinds of Contents views:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Icon view
<P>
An<I> Icon view</I> displays each object as an icon. Its purpose is to give
the user an easy way to change the position of objects or to otherwise directly
manipulate them. An object usually is represented by only one icon. However,
for some tasks, the user might find it convenient to represent an object
with more than one icon. For example, the user might want a representation
of a printer object in more than one place so that the user can have easy
access to the printer from anywhere. The user can create an additional icon,
known as a<I> shadow</I>, to represent the same printer object. The following
figure shows an Icon view:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_ViewsofObjects_26.gif" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=711 ALIGN=center>

<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Details view
<P>
A<I> Details view</I> combines small icons with text that provides additional
information about objects. The type of information displayed depends on
the type of object and the type of tasks the user wants to perform. A Details
view gives the user access to some of the object's more frequently used
information, without requiring the user to open the object. Small icons
are included in a Details view to provide a way for the user to easily recognize
objects and to directly manipulate each object. The following figure shows
a Details view:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_ViewsofObjects_27.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=244 ALIGN=center><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> 
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Settingsviews
<P>
A<I> Settings view</I> displays information about the characteristics, attributes,
or properties of an object, and provides a way for the user to change the
settings of some characteristics or properties. A Settings view typically
is provided for each type of object. The following figure shows a Settings
view of an objects:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_ViewsofObjects_28.gif" WIDTH=551 HEIGHT=453 ALIGN=center>
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Help views
<P>
A<I> Help view</I> provides information that can assist the user in working
with an object. The type of information displayed in a help view depends
on the type of help the user requests. For example,  the user can request
help for an entire window or for part of a window. The following figure
shows a help view assisting the user in working with an object:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="316_L4_ViewsofObjects_29.gif" WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=317 ALIGN=center><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
