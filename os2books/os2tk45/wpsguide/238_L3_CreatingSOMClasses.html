<H1>Creating SOM Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 257 -->
<P>
The first step in creating a SOM class is to define the class and its relationship
to other classes. In SOM, a class is defined in a formal specification language,
the SOM interface definition language (IDL). IDL has a language-neutral
core (appropriate for any programming language) to which some minor extensions
have been added to simplify programming in C. IDL supports C and C++ programming
languages. The class definition is saved in an ASCII text file with an extension
of .IDL.
<P>
The second step is to process the IDL file using the SOM compiler to produce
a set of language-specific or use-specific binding files for the class.
The binding files are then used to build class libraries that can be used
by client applications; that is, applications that are to create subclasses
or object instances.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Hereafter, any information concerning SOM bindings is specifically
geared toward the SOM C-language bindings, as distinguished from other SOM
language bindings.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
