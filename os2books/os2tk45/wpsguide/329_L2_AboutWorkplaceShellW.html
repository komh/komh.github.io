<H1>About Workplace Shell Win Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 353 -->
<P>
Outside the Workplace Shell environment, objects are DLLs that consist of
data and code that operates on that data when objects are instantiated in
the Workplace Shell run-time environment. Workplace Shell objects have no
meaning outside the Workplace Shell environment. Workplace Shell classes
take form when the class is registered with the Workplace Shell and the
class is instantiated. The Workplace Shell and SOM provide the underlying
code (predefined Workplace Shell objects' methods) that supports an object.

<P>
The Workplace Shell calls the appropriate object's methods when the user
interacts with the object. In this sense, the Workplace Shell is the client
of all Workplace Shell objects. The Workplace Shell manipulates the object
(its code) on behalf of its users.
<P>
On the other hand, applications cannot call Workplace Shell objects' methods
directly. They are not clients of Workplace Shell objects, in the same sense
that applications can be clients of SOM objects. Workplace Shell objects
are derived from the WPObject class, which, in turn, is derived from the
SOMObject class. They share all the features of SOM objects-encapsulation,
inheritance, and polymorphism-but only the Workplace Shell can directly
manipulate them.
<P>
Because there are times when applications might need to effect changes to
the Desktop and objects on the Desktop, the Workplace Shell provides functions
that permit you to proceed these changes.
