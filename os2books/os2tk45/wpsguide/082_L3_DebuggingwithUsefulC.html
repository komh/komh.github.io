<P>
The PROTSHELL= statement specifies the name of the program for the Shell
process of the Workplace Shell. The default is PMSHELL.EXE. This program
loads the Workplace process and handles restarting it, should it fail.
<P>
The SET RUNWORKPLACE= statement specifies the name of the program for the
Workplace process of the Workplace Shell. The default is also PMSHELL.EXE.
PMSHELL recognizes whether it should act as the Shell process or as the
Workplace process. Setting this to be CMD.EXE will cause an OS/2 command
prompt to be started instead of the Workplace Shell process.
<P>
The SET SHELLEXCEPTIONHANDLER=OFF statement disables the Workplace Shell
trap handler. The default is ON, which can mask problems with a Workplace
Shell application.
<P>
The SET RESTARTOBJECTS=NO statement prevents objects from being re-opened
or re-started when the Workplace Shell is initialized. This is useful when
there is an object that is causing a problem in the Workplace Shell.
