<H1>Workplace Shell Container Owner Subclass Procedure</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
Any Workplace Shell object can be inserted into any container control created
on the Workplace process using wpCnrInsertObject. When an object is inserted
into a container via _wpCnrInsertObject, the Workplace Shell subclasses
the owner of the container, and intercept some messages and notifications
from the container. In this way, the Workplace Shell provides support that
maps container records to their WPObject counterparts, and related behaviors.
In other words, using the object's instance methods to insert an object
into a container allows the object to inherit all of the Workplace Shell
features, such as context menu, and Pickup and Drop operation.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Since the Workplace Shell subclasses the container control's
owner, you can only have ONE container control into which you are inserting
objects per owner. This means you may have to expand your window hierarchy.

<P>
When a view is registered, the Workplace Shell subclasses the frame window.
The Workplace Shell adds the viewed object's context menu to the system
menu of the view. The Workplace Shell assumes that the container window
has an ID of FID_CLIENT and that the container's owner is a frame window.
This means that the container window is the client area of a frame window
that was created with WinCreateStdWindow.
<P>
When a view of an object is opened, a USAGE_OPENVIEW item is added to the
object's in-use list. The USAGE_OPENVIEW items are used to automatically
switch to the open view when the user chooses to open the same view again.
This behavior is controlled by wpOpen or wpSwitchTo. For more detail on
the USAGE_OPENVIEW item, see <A HREF="195_L1_ObjectUsageUsageMeth.html">Object
Usage: Usage Methods</A>.
