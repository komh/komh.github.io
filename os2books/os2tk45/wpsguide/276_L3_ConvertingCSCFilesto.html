<H1>Converting CSC Files to IDL Files</H1><!-- entering slot 296 -->
<P>
Object and class definitions written in the OS/2 operating system and prior
to OS/2 operating system Version 3, were defined in IBM object interface
definition language (OIDL) and placed in a class definition file, also called
a CSC file. This file was then used as input to the SOM compiler to generate
language binding files.
<P>
SOM was enhanced to conform with the Object Management Group's (OMG) Common
Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA**) standards. This required changing
the syntax of the class definition language from IBM OIDL to CORBA's interface
definition language (IDL). The bindings created by the SOM compiler were
also changed to make them compatible with the CORBA standards.
<P>
Class definitions written in OIDL and residing in CSC files should be converted
to IDL before being used with the SOM compiler. This conversion allows the
use of multiple inheritance, exception handling, type checking, and automatic
descriptor support. In addition, the programs generated from IDL class descriptions
are significantly smaller and run faster than programs generated from OIDL
class definitions.
