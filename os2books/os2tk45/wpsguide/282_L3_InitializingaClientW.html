<H1>Initializing a Client Workplace Shell Program</H1><!-- entering slot 303 -->
<P>
A DSOM application will not execute if the underlying DSOM support is not
active. Therefore a good client application might query and save the current
state of the DSOM daemon and Workplace Shell DSOM server and start them,
if required before issuing any DSOM calls.
<P>
A client application must declare and initialize the DSOM run-time before
attempting to create or access a remote object. The SOMD_Init procedure
initializes all of the DSOM run-time. A client application must also merge
the SOM class manager with the Workplace Shell class manager and initialize
all application classes used by the program. For each class, the corresponding
&lt;classname&gt;NewClass call should be made. When creating a Workplace
Shell DSOM application, each class referenced in the hierarchy must be initialized.

<P>
