<H1>Obtaining the Object's MINIRECORDCORE Pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
The wpQueryCoreRecord method is used to obtain a pointer to the MINIRECORDCORE
structure associated with a given object. When an object is created, the
Workplace Shell automatically allocates memory for a MINIRECORDCORE structure
and stores a pointer to it in the object's instance data. The following
shows the syntax of wpQueryCoreRecord:
<PRE>#define INCL_WINWORKPLACE
#include &lt;os2.h&gt;

PMINIRECORDCORE wpQueryCoreRecord (WPObject *self);

</PRE>

<P>
The<I> self</I> (WPObject *) paramter is the pointer to the object on which
the method is being invoked. It points to an object of class WPObject.
<P>
The<I> pRecord</I> (PMINIRECORDCORE) parameter is returned. It points to
the MINIRECORDCORE structure for the object.
<P>
Every object has a MINIRECORDCORE structure associated with it so it can
be placed into a container. This method is used to obtain the PMINIRECORDCORE
when the pointer to the object is known. The following figure shows how
to obtain a pointer to the MINIRECORDCORE structure associated with an object:

<PRE>PMINIRECORDCORE pRecord;
WPObject *self;

pRecord = _wpQueryCoreRecord(self);

</PRE>
