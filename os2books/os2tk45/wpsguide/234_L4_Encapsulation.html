<P>
An object has an external or<I> public</I> view that prescribes how other
objects or applications can interact with it. An object also has an internal
or<I> private</I> view that prescribes how data and methods actually are
implemented. Object implementation is hidden or<I> encapsulated</I> from
the public view.
<P>
You can externalize as much of an object's definition as they choose. However,
you should carefully consider what to choose to externalize. Published methods
and instance variables become a permanent part of an object's interface.
Unnecessary externalization of an object's definition might compromise future
compatibility.
<P>
SOM permits changes to an object's internal implementation without affecting
the compatibility of resulting binaries. This means that applications using
SOM objects will not require recompilation when the SOM object definitions
change. Full forward, binary compatibility can be retained when:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
