<H1>The Lazy Writer Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 318 -->
<BR>
The<I> Lazy writer thread</I> is responsible for writing objects' state
in its persistent form. A wpSaveDeferred results in an object subsequently
being processed by this thread. When the Lazy writer thread stores an object,
it will call _wpSaveState. This thread does not have a PM message queue.
Synchronization is controlled by event semaphores that are signaled from
various other threads. The Lazy writer thread detects periods of file system
inactivity, as well as other heuristics, and at such times performs actions
such as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
