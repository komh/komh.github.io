<H1>The Shell Process</H1><!-- entering slot 312 -->
<P>
While the Shell process can be any application (xxx.EXE), PMSHELL.EXE is
the default. This section describes the behavior of PMSHELL.EXE specifically.
The important features of the Shell process are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Starter thread is always running on the main Shell
process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the Starter thread detects that the Workplace process
is not started or has died, it will automatically restart it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The threads in this section are initiated from the Shell process and are
closely tied to the functioning of the Workplace process.
