<P>
The wpUnInitData method is the opposite of wpInitData. It is called by WPObject's
override of somDestruct just prior to freeing the object's memory, during
the process of making the object dormant or destroying it. The object's
instance data, and memory allocated via wpAllocMem, are automatically deallocated.
Override this method if your object has allocated additional resources since
the last time it was awakened.
