A<I> container object</I> holds other objects. Its primary purpose is to
provide a way for the user to group related objects for easy access and
retrieval. To illustrate its importance, consider the example of the design
of a software model of a car dealership. A salesperson needs a car object
to represent each car model on his lot. He also needs a customer object
to represent each customer who purchases a car. He needs a worksheet object
to track sales, profits, inventory, customers, and so on. Finally, he needs
a container objects to group these objects. The following figure shows a
