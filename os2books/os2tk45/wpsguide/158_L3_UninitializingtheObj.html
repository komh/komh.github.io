<H1>Uninitializing the Object</H1><!-- entering slot 167 -->
<P>
The wpUnInitData method is executed just prior to deallocation of the object's
memory during the process of making the object dormant or its permanent
destruction. We want to deallocate all the memory and other resources allocated
during this instantiation of the object. Memory allocated via wpAllocMem()
is freed automatically by one of the Workplace Shell ancestors, so we need
not do it here. As in the override of wpUnInitData, the multiple inheritance
issue should be addressed here as well. The following sample code shows
the use of wpUnInitData:
<PRE>SOM_Scope void SOMLINK stk_wpUnInitData(
                       Stack *somSelf)  // In - pointer to the object
{
  StackData *somThis = StackGetData(somSelf);
  StackMethodDebug("Stack","stk_wpUnInitData");

  if (_bInitialized)
  {
    _bInitialized = FALSE;
    _clsDecObjectCount(_somGetClass(somSelf), STK_AWAKECOUNT);
  } /* Endif */
  parent_wpUnInitData(somSelf);
} // End stk_wpUnInitData

</PRE>
