:i1 id=abtStl.Workplace Shell Stack Object
:p.
The Workplace Shell Stack object is a sample Workplace Shell SOM
application that demonstrates the use of Workplace
Shell setup and cleanup methods.
The application provides a new object class, Stack, whose
instances implement standard programming push down stacks.
WPAbstract is the parent class of the Stack class providing persistence
of the stack entries, via the OS2.INI file.
The Stack class also maintains the number of permanent
object instances and currently awaken objects
(instantiated in memory).
:p.
A Settings notebook page has been added to each object allowing the
user to view a stacks contents, push new items onto the stack, and
pop existing items from the stack.
The awake and total object counts are also displayed on each
object's new notebook page.
