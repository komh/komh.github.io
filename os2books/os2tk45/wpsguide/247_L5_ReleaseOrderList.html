<P>
The default processing order for methods can be overriden, however, by including
a release order list in the implementation section of the IDL file. The
<I>release order list</I> directs the SOM compiler to process the method
definitions in the order specified in the list, as opposed to the order
in the interface section. New methods should always be added to the end
of the release order list to preserve compatibility with client applications.
This allows you to describe the methods in the interface section in any
order. In particular, new methods may be inserted in the middle of the existing
methods without affecting client applications.
