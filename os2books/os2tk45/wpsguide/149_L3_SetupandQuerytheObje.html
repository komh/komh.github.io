<H1>Setup and Query the Object's State</H1><!-- entering slot 157 -->
<P>
One of the last steps of object creation or awakening is setting the object
to the initialized state. The wpIsObjectInitialized method queries the object
for this indication.
<P>
The last step is the invocation of wpObjectReady. This is a notification
to the object indicating completion of the creation or awakening operation.
Override this method if you want to receive this notification. The wpObjectReady
method indicates when it is safe to call wpSaveDeferred on a newly instantiated
object.
