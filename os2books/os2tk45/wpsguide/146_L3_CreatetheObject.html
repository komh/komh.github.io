<P>
When an object is created, by using WinCreateObject for example, wpclsNew
is called. You will likely not be concerned with this method because it
performs functions such as allocating memory for the object, getting SOM
to initialize the object, and creating the persistent image of the object
as file system attributes or .INI file entries. You will be interested in
methods that it invokes. These include wpInitData and wpSetupOnce.
