<H1>Instance Query Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>
The instance query methods are used to define the properties of an instance
of your object. You would normally override these methods to define the
unique properties of the instance of the object. For example, you might
override wpclsQueryStyle if you want to prevent all instances of your object
from being deleted. However, you would override wpQueryStyle to prevent
only certain instances of this object from being deleted, as shown in the
following sample code:
<PRE>ULONG SOMLINK myfdr_wpQueryStyle(MyFolder *somSelf)
{
  ULONG ulStyle;
  ULONG ulAttr;

  MyFolderMethodDebug("MyFolder","myfdr_wpQueryStyle");
  ulStyle = parent_wpQueryStyle(somSelf);
  ulAttr  = _wpQueryAttr( somSelf );

  if (ulAttr &amp; FILE_READONLY)
  {
    ulStyle |= OBJSTYLE_NODELETE;
  }
  return ulStyle;
}

</PRE>
