<H1>Sample Code for Setup/Cleanup Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 169 -->
<P>
This section illustrates a complete setup/cleanup sample program.
<P>
The Workplace Shell Stack object is a sample Workplace Shell SOM application
that demonstrates the use of the setup and cleanup methods. The complete
program provides a new object class, Stack, whose instances implement standard
programming push down stacks. WPAbstract is the parent class of the Stack
class providing persistence of the stack entries, via the OS2.INI file.
The Stack class also maintains the number of permanent object instances
and currently awake objects (instantiated in memory).
<P>
A Settings notebook page has been added to each object allowing the user
to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->View a stack's contents<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Push new items onto the stack<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pop existing items from the stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The awake and total object counts are also displayed on each object's new
notebook page. The following figure shows the Stack Settings notebook:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="160_L2_SampleCodeforSetupCl_20.gif" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=373 ALIGN=center>
