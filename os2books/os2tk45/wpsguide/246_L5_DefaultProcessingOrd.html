<BR>

<P>
The order in which the SOM compiler processes the attributes and methods
described in the IDL file is critical for future compatibility when new
attributes or methods might be introduced in the class definition. By default,
when the SOM compiler processes the IDL file, it builds the internal data
structures for the binding files based on the order in which the attributes
and methods are described in the interface section of the IDL file. If,
at a later date, new data or methods change the original ordering of methods
for the class, the binding files and class library are built differently.
Client applications then must be recompiled.
