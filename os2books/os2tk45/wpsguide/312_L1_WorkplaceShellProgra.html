<P>
The Desktop (which also is an object), the objects that appear on the Desktop,
and the underlying code supporting these objects constitute the OS/2 Workplace
Shell, the default OS/2 user interface. Likewise, methods in the Workplace
Shell are methods that were implemented for the creation of the Desktop
object and its objects. This chapter describes Workplace Shell classes and
characteristic behaviors of Workplace Shell objects. Because Workplace Shell
objects are built using the IBM System Object Model (SOM), the OS/2 Workplace
Shell Programming Interface requires a knowledge of SOM. It assumes a knowledge
of object-oriented programming and design concepts, as well as SOM.
