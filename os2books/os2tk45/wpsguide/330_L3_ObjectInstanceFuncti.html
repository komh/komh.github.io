<P>
Applications can create and destroy object instances of Workplace Shell
classes by calling WinCreateObject and WinDestroyObject. To create an object,
an application must specify the object's:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Class name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Title<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Setup information<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Location on the Desktop.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Each object class defines a set of keynames that can be used to control
the attributes and behavior of its objects. An object's setup information
is processed by wpSetup inherited from WPObject. The wpSetup method is called
when the object is created by WinCreateObject. Every Workplace Shell class
inherits the set of keynames defined for the WPObject class, and can define
additional ones that are unique to that class. Keynames and the values supported
by the WPObject class are listed in the "Workplace Shell Setup Strings"
subsection of the "Object Initialization and Termination: Setup/Cleanup
Methods" section.
<P>
Newly created objects need to be placed somewhere on the Desktop, either
directly on the Desktop or in a folder. All Workplace Shell objects have
object IDs associated with them. The following table shows the object IDs
associated with system folders. When an object is created by WinCreateObject,
an application can specify its location as one of the predefined system
folders.

<P>
WinCreateObject returns a handle to the newly created object. This handle
is persistent and can be used at any time to reference the object. Applications
that did not create the object can get a handle to the object by calling
WinQueryObject. WinQueryObject requires either a full path name for a file
object or an object ID.
<P>
Applications that get a handle to an object can change the behavior or state
of that object by calling WinSetObjectData. This function results in the
Workplace Shell calling the object's wpSetup method. By specifying a value
for keyname variables defined for the object's class, an application, can
effect changes to objects that already exist on the Desktop. The process
of effecting changes to existing objects on the Desktop is summarized in
the following figure:
<PRE>/* Use ObjectID to get the handle to the object */
WinQueryObject(...);

/* Put keyname values in a setup string */
pszSetupString="KEYNAME1=value;...";

/* Change the behavior of an existing object */
WinSetObjectData(...);
