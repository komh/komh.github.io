<H1>Using the Workplace Shell Class List Object Utility</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
The Toolkit provides a Workplace Shell Class List Object that is automatically
installed during the installation of the Toolkit. This object is a tool
that provides a windowed user interface for general Workplace Shell class
registration and object creation activities. It performs all the methods
that a typical Workplace Shell object installation program must provide,
with the exception of copying files from an installation diskette to a hard
disk. It is a fast and easy way to build and test objects in an application
development environment.
<P>
The Workplace Shell Class List Object Utility displays a hierarchical list
of all classes registered with the Workplace Shell. You can add a class
to this list or perform a number of actions on a specific class in the list.
You can also create an instance of the class, replace and unreplace the
class, and delete the class.
<P>
The Workplace Shell Class List Object Utility uses WinEnumObjectClasses
to get the list of all classes registered with the Workplace Shell. WinEnumObjectClasses
returns only the name of the class and the DLL module that contains the
class definition. It does not return information on the class ancestry that
can be used to construct a hierarchical list of classes. Because the Workplace
Shell Class List Object Utility is a Workplace Shell object, it can call
the somParent function to determine parentage of each class and use this
information to construct the list.
<P>
The Workplace Shell Class List Object Utility uses the following methods:

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This tool can be used to delete any Workplace Shell class
other than the predefined Workplace Shell classes provided with the OS/2
operating system Version 2.0. You should understand Workplace Shell classes
and how they are defined so that they can be recovered. Because the general
user may not have this level of understanding, you should not distribute
this tool with their objects to the users. The recommended way of delivering
objects to them is through installation programs or batch files.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
