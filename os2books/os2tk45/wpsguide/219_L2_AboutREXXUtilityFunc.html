<H1>About REXX Utility Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 238 -->
<P>
The power of REXX is often overlooked by many people as to how much benefits
one can receive by using a command based language. REXX which stands for
restructured extended executor was created to offer an easy way to ask the
operating system to perform a special task without writing hundreds or sometimes
thousands of lines of computer code to do the same task. The simplicity
of REXX is by far its strongest point along with its ease of use. REXX provides
the facility for the Workplace Shell to create, modify, and delete objects
in a very simplistic way.
<P>
REXXUTIL is a dynamic link library (REXXUTIL.DLL) that provides specific
functionality to the Workplace Shell, which allows manipulating Workplace
Shell classes as well as objects. A complete description of the commands
can be found  in the<I> OS/2 Command Reference</I> or the online version
which is located in the OS/2 Information folder.
<P>
To use a REXXUTIL function in a REXX program, you must first register the
function using RxFuncAdd. However, you have the choice of either registering
one function using RxFuncAdd or you can register all functions by first
registering SysLoadFuncs using RxFuncAdd. The following example shows how
to register a single function:
<PRE>call RxFuncAdd 'SysSetObjectData', 'RexxUtil', 'SysSetObjectData'
</PRE>

<P>
The function SysSetObjectData is the only function in this case that is
registered by RxFuncAdd. The following example shows how to register all
of the functions using RxFuncAdd:
<PRE>call RxFuncAdd 'SysLoadFuncs', 'RexxUtil', 'SysLoadFuncs'
call SysLoadFuncs
</PRE>

<P>
Using SysLoadFuncs allows all of the OS/2 sessions to use the REXXUTIL functions.
