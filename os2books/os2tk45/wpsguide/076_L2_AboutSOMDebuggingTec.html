<P>
Normally when an application is not working correctly, adding temporary
printf statements or WinMessageBox calls can provide additional debugging
information. SOM provides somPrintf that writes debugging information to
the current stdout device. This is usually not convenient for Workplace
Shell applications, because they are implemented in DLLs.
<P>
To redirect the debugging output to another location, SOM provides a replaceable
procedure called SOMOutCharRoutine. In addition to handling calls from somPrintf,
the SOMOutCharRoutine is also invoked by the &lt;classname&gt;MethodDebug
calls in every method. By replacing this procedure, output can be redirected
from stdout to a more suitable location. When debugging is complete, the
user-defined procedure can be removed or commented-out.
<P>
Debugging information can be written to any number of places:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To stderr<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To a window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To the clipboard<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To a log file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Or any combination of the above.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
