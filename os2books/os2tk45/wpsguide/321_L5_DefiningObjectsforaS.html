<H1>Defining Objects for a Software Model</H1><!-- entering slot 343 -->
<BR>

<P>
To design a software model that serves the needs of the users, the car dealership
example is translated into:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Who are the users?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->What tasks do they perform?<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In this example, the salesperson is the user. The user's tasks can include:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Determining what a customer wants, needs, and can
afford<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Determining what cars are in stock that match the
customer's wants, needs, and budget<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Negotiating an agreement using a worksheet<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Getting approval from the sales manager<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Giving the worksheet information to the finance manager.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
From this analysis, the objects that should be part of our software model
can be identified. These include a car object, car lot object, customer
object, customer list object, worksheet object, worksheet list object, salesperson
object, sales manager object, and finance manager object.
<P>
To simplify this explanation, consider the car object only. Each car object
represents a real car for sale in the car lot. A car object contains descriptive
information about the corresponding real car, such as its year, make, model,
price, factory-installed options, color, and vehicle identification number.
Because the primary purpose of a car object is to convey information, the
car object is a data object.
