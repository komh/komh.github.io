<H1>Designing an Object-Oriented User Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 342 -->
<P>
The following items are key to designing an object-oriented user interface:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Objects and their relationships<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Visual representations of objects<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Interaction techniques and mechanisms.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Objects and their relationships can be defined by answering the following
questions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->What objects does the user require?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>How
are the objects related?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>What properties and behaviors should the objects
have?<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To illustrate the importance of objects and their relationships, consider
the example of the design of a software model of a car dealership. A salesperson
needs a car object to represent each car model on his lot. He also needs
a customer object to represent each customer that purchases a car. He needs
a worksheet object to track sales, profits, inventory, customers, and so
on. Finally, he needs container objects to group these objects.
<P>
The visual representations of objects must ensure consistency with one another
and with the operating system. Visual representations of objects should
address the functional aspects of visual representations, such as usability
and purpose: Does the visual convey the purpose of the object being represented?
Visual representations also should address the aesthetic aspects, such as
shape, size, and color: Is the representation visually pleasing?
<P>
Users should interact with similar objects in similar ways and in ways that
seem natural. Users also should have a choice of interaction mechanisms
that suits their tasks, level of skill, and preferred style of interaction.
In the car dealership example, a salesperson must be able to place information
into a worksheet object in any of several ways. The salesperson can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Place a car object on top of the worksheet object,
thereby transferring information about the car to the worksheet<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Type the information directly into the worksheet object
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select portions of information from the car object
and copy them to the worksheet object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
