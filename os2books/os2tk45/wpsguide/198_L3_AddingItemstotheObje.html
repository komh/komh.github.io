<P>
The wpAddToObjUseList method adds items to the object's in-use list. When
an object's memory is allocated, wpAllocMem calls wpAddToObjUseList to add
a USAGE_MEMORY item to the object's in-use list. The allocated memory immediately
follows the MEMORYITEM data structure. The following figure shows the syntax
of the MEMORYITEM data structure:
<PRE>typedef struct _MEMORYITEM
{
  ULONG   cbBuffer;   /* Number of bytes in memory block */
}MEMORYITEM;

</PRE>

<P>
The wpOpen method calls wpAddToObjUseList to add a USAGE_OPENVIEW item to
the object's in-use list. The wpSwitchTo method scans the in-use list for
USAGE_OPENVIEW items to give focus to an already existing view. In general,
wpViewObject is used instead of wpOpen because wpViewObject considers the
setting in the Object open behavior group-box control on the Window page
of the Settings notebook, and calls either  wpOpen or wpSwitchTo. The following
figure shows the syntax of the VIEWITEM data structure:
<PRE>typedef struct _VIEWITEM
{
  ULONG   view;              /* Object view that this represents */
  LHANDLE handle;            /* Open handle                      */
  ULONG ulViewState;         /* View state flags                 */
  HWND hwndCnr;              /* Used only by system              */
  PMINIRECORDCORE pRecord;   /* Used only by system              */
}VIEWITEM;

</PRE>

<P>
When wpSetLinkToObject is called to link a shadow to the object it points
to, wpAddToObjUseList is called to add the USAGE_LINK item to the original
object's in-use list. The following figure shows the syntax of the LINKITEM
data structure:
<PRE>typedef struct _LINKITEM
{
  WPObject *LinkObj;         /* The link object  */
}LINKITEM;

</PRE>

<P>
When a data file is opened, its associated program is started and a USAGE_OPENFILE
use-item is added to the data file's in-use list. The following figure shows
the syntax of the VIEWFILE data structure:
<PRE>typedef struct _VIEWFILE
{
  ULONG   ulMenuId;          /* Menu id if association or menu page */
  LHANDLE handle;            /* Open handle                         */
  HWND    hwndCnr;           /* Used only by system                 */
  PMINIRECORDCORE pRecord;   /* Used only by system                 */
}VIEWFILE;

</PRE>
