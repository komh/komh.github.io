<H1>Creating and Installing Workplace Shell Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
This chapter walks you through the Car sample which is included in the Toolkit,
and through WPStyler, a complete sample program. The purpose is to provide
detail information on how to create an object. For each sample, the different
Workplace Shell instance and class methods used, along with the new methods
introduced by each of them, are explained. Once objects are created, they
can be installed on the Desktop in two ways: by running an installation
program or batch file, or by using the Workplace Shell Class List Object
Utility. As objects can also reside on the Toolbar, this chapter describes
the different setup strings and methods used with the Toolbar. Finally,
this chapter explains how to support printing the contents of an object
from the Desktop.
