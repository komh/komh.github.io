<H1>About Save/Restore Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 203 -->
<P>
A Workplace Shell object can exist in two states:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Dormant: persistent form of object when it is stored
away on disk. If the object's class is a descendant of WPFileSystem, its
data is stored in the object's extended attributes. If it is a descendant
of WPAbstract, its data is stored in the .INI file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Awakened: object is instantiated as a SOM object that
can have methods invoked upon it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The wpSaveState method will save the value of certain instance variables
to a persistent storage location. The wpRestoreState method will restore
these values for a newly awakened object. The Workplace Shell uses these
methods to maintain important instance data for each object. If you write
a subclass of a Workplace Shell class that includes its own new instance
data, you must override these methods to ensure that the new instance data
values are saved/restored along with the rest of the object's data.
<P>
The following events trigger the Save/Restore methods:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Workplace Shell calls wpRestoreState when an object
is awakened.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The wpSaveImmediate method calls wpSaveState to save
its data to disk.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An application must save an object to disk when a
critical instance variable is changed. The wpSaveImmediate method performs
the save on the Workplace User-interface thread, and is therefore a synchronous
operation. The wpSaveDeferred method causes the save to take place on a
separate thread, asynchronously. Therefore, for performance reasons, wpSaveDeferred
should be used in preference to wpSaveImmediate.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Workplace Shell calls wpSaveDeferred to asynchronously
save the object's state when:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->An object is closed<!-- lm: 0x2 8 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>An
object is made dormant<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The system is shut down.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
If you are implementing a subclass of a Workplace Shell class with its own
instance variables that are supposed to persist, override wpSaveState and
wpRestoreState. In the override for wpSaveState, call wpSaveData, wpSaveLong,
or wpSaveString, for each piece of data you want saved, depending on the
type of each piece of instance data associated with the object. Likewise,
the override for wpRestoreState should call wpRestoreData, wpRestoreLong,
or wpRestoreString, for each piece of data to be restored.
<P>
The wpSaveState and wpRestoreState methods use a key to identify each piece
of data for an object. This key is made up of the class name and a unique
ULONG. Together, this key should uniquely identify a given piece of data
for the object. For user-defined subclass instance data, assign a ULONG
to each piece of data. Supply that ULONG along with your class name to wpSaveData,
wpSaveLong, or wpSaveString, when saving that piece of data. Likewise, supply
that ULONG along with your class name to wpRestoreData, wpRestoreLong, or
wpRestoreString, when restoring that piece of data.
