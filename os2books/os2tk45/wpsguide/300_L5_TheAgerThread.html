<BR>
The<I> Ager thread</I> is responsible for aging notifications for an appropriate
amount of time so that intermediate file system modifications are not unnecessarily
processed by the Workplace Shell. For example, removing the possibility
of a short-lived, application generated file from appearing and then immediately
disappearing from the view of an open folder. When a notification has aged
appropriately, the Ager thread notifies the Object thread that a notification
is ready. The actual processing of the notification takes place from the
Object thread, upon receiving such notification.
