<P>
Distributed SOM (DSOM) provides a framework that allows application programs
to access objects across address spaces. That is, application programs can
access objects in other processes, even on different machines. Both the
location and implementation of an object are hidden from the client which
accesses the object (using method calls) in the same manner regardless of
its location.
