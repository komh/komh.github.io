<P>
For the Workplace Shell to know how to manipulate objects on the user's
behalf, it must know about the object class and the class definition, that
is, its data and methods. Therefore, object classes must be registered with
the Workplace Shell. The following functions enable applications to affect
object classes registered with the Workplace Shell:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WinEnumObjectClasses<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WinRegisterObjectClass<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WinDeregisterObjectClass<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WinReplaceObjectClass.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
WinEnumObjectClasses enables an application to get the list of all Workplace
Shell object classes that have been registered with the Workplace Shell.

<P>
WinRegisterObjectClass and WinDeregisterObjectClass permit an application
to register and deregister Workplace Shell object classes with the Workplace
Shell. WinRegisterObjectClass registers the specified Workplace Shell object
class that is defined in the specified DLL module that was created using
the SOM compiler. The name of the object class must match the library name
specified in the DEF file used to build the DLL. Because all registered
classes are maintained in the OS2.INI file and are cached upon system initialization,
a class should be removed, if it is no longer needed.
<P>
WinReplaceObjectClass is used to replace a registered object class with
another class. The replacement class is a subclass of the class being replaced.
This type of class is useful for modifying the behavior of instances of
a Workplace Shell object class without the instances being aware of the
new class. WinReplaceObjectClass also is used to undo the replacement and
restore the original class that defines the behavior of its instances.
