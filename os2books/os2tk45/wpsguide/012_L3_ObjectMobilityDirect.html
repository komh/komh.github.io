<H1>Object Mobility: Direct Manipulation Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
Direct manipulation refers to the OS/2 object mobility. That is, it refers
to the OS/2 user capability of moving an object from one container to another
by dragging an object icon from a source container and dropping it on a
target container. Direct manipulation methods allow you to specify how objects
that are directly effected by such a move communicate with each other. This
chapter outlines the protocols of direct manipulation with respect to their
interactions with the Workplace Shell.
