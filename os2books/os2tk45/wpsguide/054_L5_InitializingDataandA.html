<P>
The wpclsInitData method is called when an object class is instantiated.
WPStyler first calls its parent, and it then locates the class file by class
name so that it can query the module handle and save it as class data. WPStyler
also loads and saves a pointer to its Desktop icon. If any class data is
allocated in wpclsInitData, then you should override wpclsUnInitData to
free that data when the class is destroyed.
