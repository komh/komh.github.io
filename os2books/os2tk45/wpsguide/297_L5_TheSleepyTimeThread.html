<H1>The Sleepy Time Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 319 -->
<BR>
An object, in its dormant state, consists of a block of data written in
a persistent form, for example, a series of appnames in the INI file, or
a file's extended attributes. Conversely, when an object is awake, it is
instantiated in memory. To reduce the number of objects that exist in memory,
when objects are no longer visually exposed, they are added to a list of
<I>sleeping objects</I>. The<I> Sleepy time thread</I> maintains this list
of objects that may need to be made dormant, and progressively ages them
until they are either removed from the sleepy object list, or until they
need to be made dormant. Incidentally, when an object is locked it cannot
be made dormant. This prevents objects that may not be visibly exposed to
remain in memory on demand. The Sleepy time thread sends a notification
to the Object thread, which will cause the object to be made dormant, when
it has been on the sleepy object list for the OBJECTSNOOZETIME period specified
in the CONFIG.SYS file.
