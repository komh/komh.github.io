<H1>The Workplace Shell: Object-Oriented User/Programming Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell constitutes the interface with which users interact
with the operating system. It represents items that users most frequently
manipulate as familiar objects on a Desktop. As a user interface, the Workplace
Shell conforms to many of the guidelines described by the Common User Access*
(CUA*).
<P>
In addition to being an interface through which a user can organize and
work with the operating system, the Workplace Shell provides its programming
interface to you. This means that applications can blend into the operating
system's user interaction model, allowing users to work with new applications
in the same manner as the operating system itself.
<P>
By exploiting the Workplace Shell's application programming interface, you
can also reuse and build on much of the functionality already implemented
by the Workplace Shell. By using the Workplace Shell methods, an application
can implement its interface so that it includes familiar Workplace Shell
user interaction tools such as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Objects presented to the user on the Desktop<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Common mouse/keyboard interaction techniques<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Settings notebook to manipulate attributes of the
application<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Dynamic context menus to present operational choices
to user<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Object mobility via Drag and Drop operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Application view management with the OS/2 Window list.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to the portion of the functions devoted to managing the presentation
of the application's user interface, the Workplace Shell also provides functions
(methods) to help coordinate the implementation of the application.
