<H1>Creation of New Instances of Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 34 -->
<P>
An object template is the primary user mechanism for creating new instances
of objects. Specifically, a template is a state of an object where the default
Drag operation is<B> Create another</B>, that is, dragging and dropping
the template results in the creation of an instance of the object. The visual
representation of a template is the object's icon on top of a "yellow sticky
pad" with the top sheet slightly peeled up, as shown in the following figure:

<P>
Any object that supports the<B> Create another</B> item can be changed by
the user to and from a template state by selecting the template checkbox
on the General page in the object's Settings notebook. A template is created
automatically when a class is registered, unless the class wpclsQueryStyle
returns CLSSTYLE_NEVERTEMPLATE.
<P>
When the operating system is first installed, template objects reside in
the templates folder on the desktop. The templates folder always contains
a template object for each class of object installed on the system that
supports the<B> Create another</B> item. Any new object registered by WinRegisterObjectClass
that supports the<B> Create another</B> item automatically appears in this
folder. A template for each object class registered using this function
cannot be removed from the templates folder.
