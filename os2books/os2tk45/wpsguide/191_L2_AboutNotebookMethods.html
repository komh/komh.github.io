<P>
WPObject defines a General page in the Settings notebook for all classes
of objects. Because all Workplace Shell objects have general properties
associated with them, therefore, all Workplace Shell objects have a General
page in their Settings notebook. The General page describes all the general
object properties such as the object's title, icon, and whether or not the
object is a template.
<P>
The title or icon of an object can be changed using the General page. For
WPAbstract objects, the title and icon change is saved in the OS2.INI file.
For the WPFileSystem objects, the title change is saved in the .LONGNAME
extended attributes, and the icon change is saved in the .ICON extended
attributes.
<P>
WPObject also defines a Window page in the Settings notebook for all classes
of objects. Most of the Abstract objects have both General and Window pages
in the Settings notebook. Some Abstract objects like mouse and keyboard
do not have a Window page because they have no open views other than Settings.

<P>
Settings notebook pages for Workplace Shell objects are inherited from the
ancestors of the Workplace Shell class. This means that they include pages
that have been added or removed by their ancestor classes, in addition to
the General and Window pages inherited from the root, WPObject class.
<P>
For example, suppose that MyObject is a persistent object derived from the
WPAbstract class. Because WPAbstract is derived from the WPObject class,
MyObject inherits the characteristics and behaviors of WPAbstract and WPObject.
WPAbstract inherits its Settings notebook from WPObject. MyObject, therefore,
inherits WPObject's Settings notebook.
<P>
Now suppose that MyObject class defines two additional pages in its Settings
notebook, MyPage_1 and MyPage_2. This means that the Settings notebook for
MyObject class has four pages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->General<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MyPage_1<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MyPage_2<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Consider that YourObject class is derived from MyObject class. Therefore,
by inheritance, YourObject class defines the following pages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->General<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Window
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>MyPage_1<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>MyPage_2<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
in its Settings notebook. YourObject class defines an additional page in
its Settings notebook, YourPage. The Settings notebook for YourObject class
has now five pages:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
General<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Inherited from the WPObject class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Window
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Inherited from the WPObject class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MyPage_1
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Inherited from MyObject class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MyPage_2
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Inherited from MyObject class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> YourPage
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Defined by YourObject.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The tabs in the Settings notebook for MyObject and YourObject are shown
in the following figure:

<P>
Every Settings notebook in the Workplace Shell should have Undo, Default,
and Help push buttons. Any changes to the Settings notebook takes effect
immediately, although sometimes the changes are delayed until the focus
is changed.
