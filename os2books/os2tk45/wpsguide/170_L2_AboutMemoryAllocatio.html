<H1>About Memory Allocation Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 184 -->
<P>
The wpAllocMem method allocates memory for use by an object. A record of
memory blocks allocated by calls to wpAllocMem is kept by adding USAGE_MEMORY
type items to the object's USEITEM list. The USEITEM list is examined by
wpUnInitData when the object is destroyed or made dormant to free previously
allocated resources.
<P>
Memory that is allocated to an object is de-allocated automatically when
the object is no longer in use, assuming the memory has not already been
cleaned up by the object. wpFreeMem is called to free allocated memory,
even if the object is still in use. This method should be overriden to free
memory that was allocated with an override method of wpAllocMem.
