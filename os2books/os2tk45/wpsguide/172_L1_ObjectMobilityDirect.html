<P>
<I>Direct manipulation</I> is interaction with objects by way of a pointing
device. For example, using direct manipulation, a user can move an object
from one container to another by dragging an object icon from a source container
and dropping it on a target container. Direct manipulation methods allow
you to specify how objects that are directly effected by such a move communicate
with each other. This chapter outlines the protocols of direct manipulation
with respect to their interactions with the Workplace Shell. The following
material is presented as a supplement to information on direct manipulation
in the<I><I> Presentation Manager Programming Guide - Advanced Topics</I>.
