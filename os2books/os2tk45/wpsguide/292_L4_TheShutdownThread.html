<H1>The Shutdown Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 314 -->
<P>
When a shutdown is initiated, the Shutdown thread is created on the Shell
process. The<I> Shutdown thread</I> closes all running applications in the
system. The Shutdown thread creates a PM message queue. It broadcasts to
all applications a message instructing them to save their data, initiates
the closing of all open folders, and so on.
<P>
Each child process of the Shell process will send a WM_APPTERMINATENOTIFY
to the Shell process when it goes away. Unless a shutdown is in effect,
when the Shell process receives such notification for the Workplace process,
it will restart the Workplace process.
