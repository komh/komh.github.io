<P>
This rendering mechanism can be used by various containers, including file
folders and trash cans. These containers allow objects to be dragged and
dropped on white space in the container to accomplish a<B> Move</B> or<B> Copy
</B>operation. They also can allow objects in the same or another container
to be dragged and dropped on objects within the container to accomplish
an operation.
<P>
When you are using DRM_OS2FILE,<I> pDragItemulItemID</I> is not used.
<P>
If the Workplace Shell is to do target rendering,<I> *(pDragItemhstrContainerName)
</I>is specified. It is the name of the directory that contains the file
or the directory being dragged. Leave this field NULL if you want the Workplace
Shell to send DM_RENDER messages, that is, to do source rendering for this
object.
<P>
<I>*(pDragItemhstrSourceName)</I> is the file or directory name being dragged
and must be specified.
<P>
<I>*(pDragItemhstrTarget)</I> is the suggested name of the file or directory
at the target.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If<I> pDragItemhstrContainerName</I> and<I> pDragItemhstrSourceName
</I>are both specified, the Workplace Shell converts the item being dragged
to an object and treats it like a DRM_OBJECT.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
