<P>
REXX combines the simplicity of a programming language such as BASIC with
features that exist in more powerful languages such as C, PASCAL, or PL/1.
Part of the success of REXX has been due in part to having been selected
as the Systems Application Architecture* Programming Language (SAA/PL).
The purpose is to provide a common look and feel across all operating systems.
This is important because CUA is the standard that the Workplace Shell uses
which is also part of SAA* REXX provides the facility for the Workplace
Shell to create, modify, and delete objects. This chapter describes the
REXX functions and how to use them in Workplace Shell applications.
