<H1>Adding and Removing Class Items to a Pop-Up Menu</H1><!-- entering slot 224 -->
<P>
New items are added to the pop-up menu inherited from an object's ancestors
by overriding the object's wpModifyPopupMenu and calling wpInsertPopupMenuItems.
For example, to add<B> New item</B> to MyObject's pop-up menu, the new menu
item is defined in a resource file in the same manner as menus are defined
in PM programs. An ID is assigned to the new menu and to the menu item,
as shown in the following sample code:
<PRE>#define ID_MOREITEMS  WPMENUID_USER+1
#define ID_NEWITEMS   WPMENUID_USER+2

MENU ID_MOREITEMS LOADONCALL MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE
  BEGIN
    MENUITEM "New Item", ID_NEWITEMS
  END

</PRE>

<P>
Menu items can also be deleted by overriding wpModifyPopupMenu and by sending
the MM_DELETEITEM message to the menu.
<P>
User defined menu items must be greater than 0x6500. IDs for class-specific
menus and menu items have a value greater than WPMENUID_USER, so they do
not conflict with IDs for menus and menu items defined by the Workplace
Shell classes, as shown in the following sample code:
<PRE>/* Add a new item to MyObject's pop-up menu */
SOM_Scope BOOL32 SOMLINK MyObject_wpModifyPopupMenu
  (MyObject *somSelf,HWND hwndMenu, HWND hwndCnr, ULONG ulPosition)

/* Remove an item from MyObject's pop-up menu */
WinSendMsg(hwndMenu,
           MM_DELETEITEM,
           MPFROM2SHORT(MY_ITEMID,FALSE),
           NULL);

{
  /* Insert new items in MyObject's primary menu */
  _wpInsertPopupMenuItemsA(somSelf,
                           hwndMenu,
                           ulPosition,
                           hmod,
                           ID_MOREITEMS,
                           WPMENUID_PRIMARY);

  /* Add the items inherited from MyObject's parent */
  return (parent_wpModifyPopupMenu(somSelf,
                                   hwndMenu,
                                   hwndCnr,
                                   ulPosition));
}

</PRE>

<P>
The wpInsertPopupMenuItems method requires:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A handle to the module where the menu resource is
defined<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The ID for the menu resource<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The ID for the menu where the item is being inserted.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In the above sample code, ID_MOREITEMS is the ID for the menu resource that
defines the new menu item being added to the object's primary pop-up menu.
WPMENUID_PRIMARY is the ID for the object's primary pop-up menu, where<B> New
item</B> is being inserted.
<P>
An item can be added to a pop-up submenu or conditional cascaded menu by
specifying the ID for the conditional cascaded menu on the call to wpInsertPopupMenuItems.
For example, to add<B> New item</B> to the<B> Open</B> conditional cascaded
menu, the call to wpInsertPopupMenuItems is modified as shown in the following
sample code:
<PRE>/* Insert new items in MyObject's Open submenu */_wpInsertPopupMenuItemsA(somSelf,
                         hwndMenu,
                         ulPosition,
                         hmod,
                         ID_MOREITEMS,
                         WPMENUID_OPEN);

</PRE>
