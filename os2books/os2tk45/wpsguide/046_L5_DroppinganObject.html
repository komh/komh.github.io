<P>
Once an object is dropped onto the Workplace Shell Styler, wpDrop is called.
It is, at this point, where WPStyler queries from the drag information the
self pointer of the object being dropped and save it in its instance data.
Once the self pointer of the object is acquired, a call to the parent wpOpen
is made open the Settings notebook.
