<B>object</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The elements of data and function
that programs create, manipulate, pass as arguments, and so forth. An object
is a way of associating specific data values with a specific set of named
functions (called<I> methods</I>) for a period of time (referred to as the
<I>lifetime</I> of the object). The data values of an object are referred
to as its<I> state</I>. In SOM, objects are created by other objects called
<I>classes</I>. The specification of what comprises the set of functions
and data elements that make up an object is referred to as the<I> definition
</I>of a class.
<P>
SOM objects offer a high degree of<I> encapsulation</I>. This property permits
many aspects of the implementation of an object to change without affecting
client programs that depend on the object's behavior.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
