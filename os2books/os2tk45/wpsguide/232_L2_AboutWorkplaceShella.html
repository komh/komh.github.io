<H1>About Workplace Shell and SOM</H1><!-- entering slot 251 -->
<P>
The<I> System Object Model</I> (SOM) is IBM's object-oriented programming
model which provides you language-neutral object-oriented programming mechanisms,
a set of run times for the support and management of objects, frameworks
for the implementation of classes and objects, and tools for associated
application development.
<P>
<I>Workplace Shell</I> is the OS/2 user interface and is implemented by
using the SOM functions, methods, and structures. SOM's run-time support
is what allows Workplace Shell applications to run on different levels of
the operating system without having to be recompiled.
<P>
<I>Object-oriented programming</I> is a programming paradigm based on objects,
which are programming constructs designed to reflect items in the real world.
An<I> object</I> consists of both the data necessary to describe a real-world
item and the functions necessary to describe the behavior of the item. This
is in contrast to the structured programming model, which focuses on things
that can be done to the data (the functions) and which treats the data only
as something to be acted on. Objects bind together the data that describes
an item and the functions that act on the data. The data is called the<I> object's
state</I>. The functions that define the object's behavior are called<I> methods</I>.
<I>Objects</I> are instances, or instantiations of a class. A<I> class</I> is
a description of an object. It defines the data that represents the object's
state and the methods that the object supports.
<P>
SOM is designed specifically to support the new, object-oriented paradigm,
and to be usable with both procedural (non-object-oriented) languages and
object-oriented languages. SOM is not a language-it is a system for defining,
manipulating, and releasing class libraries. SOM is used to define classes
and methods, while permitting you to choose a language for implementing
these methods. Therefore, you will be able to use SOM quickly without having
to learn a new language syntax. SOM consists of a run-time library and a
set of utility programs that support building, externalizing, and manipulating
software objects.
<P>
SOM objects are language-neutral. They can be defined in one programming
language and used by applications or objects written in another programming
language.
