<P>
When a class defines new items for its menus, it must provide for the processing
of these items when the user selects an item. This is done by overriding
wpMenuItemSelected inherited from WPObject. Depending on the item the user
selects, the method override for wpMenuItemSelected calls the object's wpOpen
to open the OPEN_CAR view or calls carBeepHorn to beep the CAR's horn.
