<H1>Including Objects in a Container</H1><!-- entering slot 120 -->
<P>
A container represents the standard mode to organize objects you work with.
It simply stores objects and allows them to interact with the user. Sometimes,
however, a container can contain unnecessary objects. For this reason, the
Workplace Shell provides a powerful tool that allows you to filter objects
you want to include in or to exclude from the container. You specify objects
to be included in a container by selecting the Include tab of the Settings
notebook. The filter for this container is specified by the criteria that
tells the system to include, in the container, all objects that match the
criteria. The default criteria is shown in the following figure:
<PRE>I Flags less than --H-

</PRE>

<P>
This criteria means that all objects that do not have the<I> hidden</I> attribute
set will be included in the Open view of the container. The following figure
shows the Include dialog, which is set with the default criteria:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="112_L3_IncludingObjectsinaC_14.gif" WIDTH=505 HEIGHT=373 ALIGN=center>
<P>
The Include dialog provides the following push buttons to manipulate criteria:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Push Button</B><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Add

</UL>Delete<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Deletes the selected
criteria.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Undo<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Resets the
criteria to the state it was in when you opened the Include tab.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Default
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Resets the criteria to the default criteria as shown
in the second previous figure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Help<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Provides
help on the Include tab.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
As an example, to set the criteria to include nothing (exclude everything),
delete the default criteria and add the criteria shown in the following
figure:
<PRE>E  ObjectClass  is equal to  Object
</PRE>
