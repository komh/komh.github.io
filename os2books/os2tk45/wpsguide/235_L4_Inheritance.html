<P>
<I>Inheritance</I> is the derivation of new child classes from existing
parent classes. Child classes inherit the characteristics of their parent
classes. This means that methods defined for a parent class automatically
are defined for the child class. In addition to those they have inherited,
child classes also can add their own characteristics. This means that child
classes can define new behavior in terms of new methods. These child classes
also are known as<I> subclasses</I>.
