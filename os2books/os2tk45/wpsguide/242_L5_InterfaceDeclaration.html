<P>
The interface declaration section describes the interfaces available to
the class. By default, all interfaces defined in this section are public
and available to client programs. These include any new methods defined
for the class, as well as attributes. Additional types, constants, and exception
structures may also be defined in this section. Any declarations defined
in this section are exported by the SOM compiler to the language binding
files. To make parts of the interface private, surround them with the preprocessor
commands as shown in the following sample code:
<PRE>//# Two underscores (__) before and after the word PRIVATE
#ifdef __PRIVATE__

//# Private attributes. constants, types, exceptions, and methods here

#endif
</PRE>

<BR>

<P>
Declaring attributes creates instance data plus two accessor methods:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One to set the value of the attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One to retrieve the value of the attribute.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
