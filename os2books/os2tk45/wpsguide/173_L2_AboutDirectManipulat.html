<H1>About Direct Manipulation Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 187 -->
<P>
Direct manipulation enables the user to visually drag an object (the source
object) and drop it on another object (the target object) causing an interaction,
or data exchange, between the objects. The Workplace Shell tracks an object
being dragged, notifying target objects and windows as the source object
is being dragged over them and when it is dropped on them. The Workplace
Shell notifies a target object by calling the object's direct manipulation
methods that process the source object being dragged and dropped. Direct
manipulation methods initialize the structures that convey information about
objects being moved to the target and describe images to be displayed during
the Drag operation.
