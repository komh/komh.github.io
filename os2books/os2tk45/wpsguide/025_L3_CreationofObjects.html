<H1>Creation of Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
The CAR sample Workplace Shell object included in the Toolkit provides an
example of how to create an object. CAR is a spin-off implementation of
the CAR object example used in the<I> Systems Application Architecture:
 Common User Access Guide to User Interface Design</I>.
<P>
The CAR object has two views:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An Open car view, which is a representation of a CAR
that moves randomly around a window.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A Settings notebook that permits the user to change
the sound of the horn, on the Horn beep page, and the speed of the CAR,
on the Dashboard page.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Horn beep and Dashboard pages in the CAR's Settings notebook are dialog
windows whose contents are defined in a dialog template in the CAR.RC resource
file. The resources are appended to the binary CAR.DLL file. The help panels
associated with the dialogs are defined in the CAR.HLP help library. The
association between the help panels and the dialogs is established with
the dialog template in the resource file.
<P>
CAR is a persistent object but not a part of the file system. Therefore,
it is derived from the WPAbstract class, which is derived from the WPObject
root Workplace Shell class. This means that CAR inherits the methods from
WPAbstract, which, in turn, inherits all of the instance and class methods
from WPObject. CAR defines new methods and overrides some instance and class
methods inherited from both WPAbstract and WPObject. New methods defined
for the CAR class are summarized in the following table:
