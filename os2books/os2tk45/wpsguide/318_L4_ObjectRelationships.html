<P>
An object class can be defined in terms of another object class. It can
be derived from another class, inheriting the same characteristics and behaviors
of the other class, yet having characteristics and behaviors of its own.
The class that it is derived from is called its<I> parent class</I>; the
class itself is referred to as a<I> subclass</I> of its parent class.
<P>
The inheritance relationship between objects is hierarchical. An object
that is lower in the inheritance hierarchy than another object has all of
the characteristics of the object or objects above it and can have new characteristics
of its own.
<P>
Other object relationships also can be hierarchical. For example, objects
can be arranged in a containment hierarchy that illustrates which objects
can contain which other objects.
