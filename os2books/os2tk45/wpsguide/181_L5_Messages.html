The following messages are used by the DRM_OS2FILE:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DM_RENDER
<P>
This message is sent by a target to a source, via wpRender, to request a
rendering for an object. When this message is received, the source determines
if it understands the rendering mechanism and format selected by the target
for the object. It also confirms that it allows the operation selected by
the user for that object. The source must respond to this message before
proceeding with the rendering operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DM_RENDERCOMPLETE
<P>
This message is posted by a source to a target, via wpRenderComplete, to
notify the target that the rendering operation has been completed by the
source, either successfully or unsuccessfully. The source can elect to let
the target retry a successful or an unsuccessful operation. In this case,
it should return to its state at the time of the drop for that object and
indicate, in the message, that a retry is allowed. Support for this message
by a source is optional. If this message is not supported, then:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The source must convey all necessary information
to the target order to allow it to handle the rendering operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->It must always indicate that native rendering is
allowed when replying to a DM_RENDER message.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>DM_ENDCONVERSATION

<P>
This message is sent by a target to a source to notify the source that the
rendering operation is complete and that the conversation is terminated.
When this message is received, the entire Drop operation for the object
is complete. The source can now release any resources it had allocated to
the drop and rendering operations. When the reply is received, the target
can release the resources it had allocated to the operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
