<H1>Object Containers: Container Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 100 -->
<P>
A<I> container</I> is a visual component that holds objects. CUA container
control is the primary way of interacting with Workplace Shell objects.
All objects with which the user interacts are simply records that have been
inserted into a container control. Any Workplace Shell object can be inserted
into any container control created on the Workplace process. This chapter
describes the different views available for containers, and the methods
used to create and manipulate containers in Workplace Shell applications.
