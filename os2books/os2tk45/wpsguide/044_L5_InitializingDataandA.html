<P>
The wpInitData method is called when an object is created or when it is
awakened from the dormant state so that it can initialize all of its instance
variables to a known state. Note that this method is called before the object's
state is known. Initialize instance data and allocate extra memory that
you might need in this method. Any memory allocated in wpInitData should
always be d eallocated in wpUnInitData, which is always called when an object
is destroyed. WPStyler does not override wpUnInitData.
