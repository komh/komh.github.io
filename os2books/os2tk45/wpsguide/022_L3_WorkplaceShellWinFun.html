<P>
Applications cannot call Workplace Shell objects' methods directly. They
are not clients of Workplace Shell objects, in the same sense that applications
can be clients of SOM objects. Workplace Shell objects are derived from
the WPObject class, which, in turn, is derived from the SOMObject class.
They share all the features of SOM objects but only the Workplace Shell
can directly manipulate them. Because there are times when applications
might need to effect changes to the Desktop and objects on the Desktop,
the Workplace Shell provides functions that permit you to proceed these
changes. This chapter describes the Workplace Shell Win Functions.
