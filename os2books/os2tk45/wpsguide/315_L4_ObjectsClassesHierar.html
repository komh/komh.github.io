<P>
An<I> object</I> is any visual component of the user interface with which
the user can work, independent of other items, to perform a task. An object
can be represented by one or more graphic images, called<I> icons</I>. The
user can interact with an object (or its icon) just as the user can interact
with objects in the real world.
