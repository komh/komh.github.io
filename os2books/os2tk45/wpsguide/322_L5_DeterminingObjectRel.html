<P>
The next step in the design of a software model is to determine how each
object interacts with other objects. In the car dealership, information
contained in car objects must be transferable to a worksheet object. The
user should have the option to drag a car object and drop it onto a worksheet
object. The user also should have the option to choose an action to copy
the information from a car object to a worksheet object.
