<BR>
The<I> Wheel watcher thread</I> is responsible for catching notifications
from the file system regarding the<B> Move</B>,<B> Copy</B>,<B> Delete</B>,
<B>Rename</B>, ... commands. Only the Workplace process in the operating
system can receive these notifications. File system notifications are then
added to a system queue, which is monitored by another thread on the Workplace
process, the Process queue thread. The Wheel watcher thread does not maintain
a PM message queue.
