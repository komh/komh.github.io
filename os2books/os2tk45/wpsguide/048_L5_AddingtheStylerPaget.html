<P>
The wpAddSettingsPages method allows each object class to insert its own
settings pages into the Settings notebook for an object. WPStyler introduces
the InsertObjectStylePage instance method. InsertObjectStylePage is called
from the wpAddSettingsPages override to insert the new dialog page into
the existing Workplace Shell Settings notebook. InsertObjectStylePage simply
fills the PAGEINFO data structure to point to the Styler dialog window and
procedure, and it then inserts that page into the notebook by calling wpInsertSettingsPage.
InsertObjectStylePage is called only if the notebook is opened for an object
that was dropped on the Styler. This method is not called when displaying
the Settings notebook for WPStyler.
