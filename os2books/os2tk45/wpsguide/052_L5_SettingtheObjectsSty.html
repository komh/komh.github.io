SetObjectStyle is a new instance method introduced by WPStyler. SetObjectStyle
queries the current state of the dialog checkboxes and then sets the style
of the dropped object accordingly, using wpSetStyle to set the style of
the object and wpSaveDeferred to save that state permanently back to the
system .INI file. SetObjectStyle also queries and sets the title text of
the object.
