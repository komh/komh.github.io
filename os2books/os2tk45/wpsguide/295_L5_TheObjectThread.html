<H1>The Object Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 317 -->
<BR>
The<I> Object thread</I> represents the Workplace object window. It is not
visible. It is used to offload I/O intensive operations from the main user-interface
thread. The Object thread has a PM message queue. It utilizes an event semaphore,
which it uses to signal the Sleepy time thread when the object thread is
idle. The Sleepy time thread uses this event semaphore to throttle itself
so that it does not fill the Object thread's message queue with make dormant
messages, which would implicitly keep the Object thread's priority higher
than the main User-interface thread's priority, and cause visibly noticeable
delays in response time.

Some of the notifications received and processed by the Object thread are
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
