<H1>Classes of Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 339 -->
<P>
Objects can be classified by similarities in characteristics and behaviors.
Each class of objects has a primary purpose that distinguishes it from other
classes, and all three types of objects can contain other objects. CUA guidelines
define three object classes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Container objects
<P>
A<I> Container object</I> holds other objects. Its primary purpose is to
provide a way for the user to group related objects for easy access and
retrieval. The following figure shows a Container object:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="317_L4_ClassesofObjects_30.gif" WIDTH=423 HEIGHT=137 ALIGN=center>

<I>Data objects</I> convey information, such as text or graphics, audio
or video information. The following figure shows a Data object:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="317_L4_ClassesofObjects_31.gif" WIDTH=428 HEIGHT=196 ALIGN=center>

A<I> Device object</I> often represents a physical object in the real world.
For example, a mouse object can represent the user's pointing device, and
a modem object can represent the user's modem. Some device objects represent
a logical object in the user's computer system rather than a physical object.
For example, a shredder object can represent a logical object that disposes
of the user's other objects. Some device objects can contain other objects.
For example, a printer object can contain a queue of objects to be printed.
