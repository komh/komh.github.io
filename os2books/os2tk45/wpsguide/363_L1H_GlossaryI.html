</UL><B> icon
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>In SAA Advanced Common User Access architecture,
a graphical representation of an object, consisting of an image, image background,
and a label. Icons can represent items (such as a document file) that the
user wants to work on, and actions that the user wants to perform. In the
Presentation Manager, icons are used for data objects, system actions, and
minimized programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> icon area</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

the Presentation Manager, the area at the bottom of the screen that is normally
used to display the icons for minimized programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL><B> image font</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A
set of symbols, each of which is described in a rectangular array of pels.
Some of the pels in the array are set to produce the image of one of the
symbols. Contrast with<I> outline font</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

choices and controls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> information device context
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A logical description of a data destination
other than the screen (for example, a printer or plotter), but where no

can produce online documentation and context-sensitive online help panels
for their applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> inheritance</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The
technique of specifying the shape and behavior of one class (called a<I> subclass</I>)
as incremental differences from another class (called the<I> parent class
</I>or<I> superclass</I>). The subclass inherits the superclass' state representation
and methods, and can provide additional data elements and methods. The subclass
also can provide new functions with the same method names used by the superclass.
Such a subclass method is said to override the superclass method, and will
be selected automatically by method resolution on subclass instances. An
overriding method can elect to call upon the superclass' method as part
of its own implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

such as a mouse or the keyboard. (2) The position in the<I> active window
