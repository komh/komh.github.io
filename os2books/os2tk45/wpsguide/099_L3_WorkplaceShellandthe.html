<H1>Workplace Shell and the Container Control</H1><!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
CUA container control is the primary key of interacting with Workplace Shell
objects. All objects with which the user interacts are simply records that
have been inserted into a container control.
<P>
The container control uses RECORDCORE and MINIRECORDCORE structures to represent
the items that it holds. Memory for these structures is allocated by sending
the container a CM_ALLOCRECORD message. When memory is allocated, the records
may be inserted using the CM_INSERTRECORD message. The Workplace Shell provides
object instance methods that perform all of this for you.
<P>
When an object is created, the Workplace Shell automatically allocates memory
for the MINIRECORDCORE structure and stores the pointer in the object's
instance data. Only one MINIRECORDCORE per object is used even if the object
exists in multiple views.
<P>
The wpQueryCoreRecord method can be used to obtain the pointer to the MINIRECORDCORE
structure that was allocated when the object was created. You would use
this method to obtain a pointer to the MINIRECORDCORE structure that the
container is using to represent the object. This may be necessary if you
need to perform a task and no instance method for that task exists. If the
container can perform the task, the application can use _wpQueryCoreRecord
to obtain the PMINIRECORDCORE and send the container a message explicitly.
The OBJECT_FROM_PREC macro performs the inverse function of _wpQueryCoreRecord
and is used to obtain a pointer to the object (self) when the pointer to
the MINIRECORDCORE structure is known.
