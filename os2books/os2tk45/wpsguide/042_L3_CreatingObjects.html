<P>
In order to illustrate what is required to create a complete Workplace Shell
object that you can use constructively, a complete Workplace Shell SOM program
is included in <A HREF="066_L2_SampleCodeforCreatin.html">Sample Code for
Creating Objects</A>. The example program is a usable Workplace Shell object
that provides the facility to change the normally unchangable style flags
of any Desktop object dropped on it. When you drop an object onto the Workplace
Shell Styler, WPSTYLER will open the Settings notebook and display a Style
settings page. On this page, you will see the current styles of the object
and be able to change them. Using the Workplace Shell Styler, you can change
the title in addition to the following behaviors: Copy, Delete, Drag, Drop,
Move, Print, Rename, Shadow and Template.
<P>
The class name is called WPStyler and is derived from WPAbstract, which
is derived from the WPObject root Workplace Shell Class. The implementation
of the WPStyler object consists primarily of overrides to instance and class
methods inherited from the WPObject and WPAbstract classes.
