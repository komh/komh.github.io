<H1>About Setup/Cleanup Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 153 -->
<P>
Setup and cleanup methods support object initialization and termination.
The setup methods are used to set up object characteristics during creation
of the object. The cleanup methods are used to ensure that memory and other
resources allocated to an object are freed when the object is no longer
in use.
