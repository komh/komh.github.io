<P>
The following sample code shows how to open an object in the Settings notebook:

<PRE>#define INCL_WINWORKPLACE
#include "os2.h"

HOBJECT hObject;
ULONG   ulView;
BOOL    fFlags
BOOL    fSuccess;

hObject = WinQueryObject("&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;");
if (hObject != NULL)
{
  /* WinQueryObject was successful */
  fSuccess = WinOpenObject(hObject,OPEN_SETTINGS,TRUE);

  if (fSuccess)
  {
    /* If concurrent views are off and a Settings notebook of the
     * Desktop already exists, then it was successfully resurfaced.
     *
     * If concurrent views are on, then another Settings notebook
     * of the Desktop was successfully opened.
     */
  }
  else
  {
    /* WinOpenObject failed */
  }
}

</PRE>
