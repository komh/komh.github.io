<H1>Exception Handler Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 842 -->
<P>
Exception handlers are passed four parameters. The interface for writing
a 32-bit exception handler is:
<PRE>    ExceptionHandler (ExceptionReportRecord,
                      ExceptionRegistrationRecord,
                      ContextRecord,
                      DispatcherContext);
</PRE>

<P>
The exception handler returns XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION to indicate that the
exception has been handled and is to be dismissed, or XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH
to indicate that the exception has not been handled and is to be passed
to the next exception handler on the chain.
<P>
Note that there are no invalid exception numbers; if a handler does not
recognize an exception number, it simply returns XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH.
<P>
In addition to handling exceptions, exception handlers are used in<I> unwind
operations</I>. An unwind operation simply calls and removes exception handlers
from the exception handler chain of the thread. Unwind exceptions are not
actually being delivered to the handlers, so the individual return codes
are irrelevant, and they do not affect the unwind operation.
<P>
A single exception handler can be used to handle all the exceptions that
you choose to handle. It is not necessary to have a separate exception handler
for each exception.
<P>
A handler is not required to return to the system; it can handle the exception,
and then continue thread execution directly. For example, when an application
executes a longjmp(), the C language compiler adds code that essentially
performs an unwind operation to clean up the stack. Execution then resumes
at the point where the target setjmp() occurred.
<P>
For synchronous exceptions, an exception handler can alter the contents
of the interrupted thread's context, except for the fields that cannot normally
be altered during thread execution. For asynchronous exceptions (signal
and termination) changes made to the context of the thread are ignored.

<P>
Some exceptions are<I> continuable</I>; if the thread's exception handler
handles the exception, execution can continue. If the exception condition
is such that execution cannot be continued safely, the exception is said
to be<I> noncontinuable</I>. If an exception is noncontinuable the EH_NONCONTINUABLE
bit is set in the exception structure, and it is an error to indicate the
exception has been handled. Returning XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION causes an
XCPT_NONCONTINUABLE_EXCEPTION exception to be raised.
<P>
Generally, exception handlers can use any function while they are handling
an exception. However, while handling a process-termination exception, an
exception handler must not call<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 FC --> DosCreateThread</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC -->DosExecPgm</A>, or<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>,
because unpredictable results can occur. A handler also must not call<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 45 --> DosExit
</A>while handling a process-termination exception, because this request
will cause the exception to be dispatched as a nested exception to the current
thread's entire chain of handlers.
