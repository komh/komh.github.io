<P>
Naming conventions for character devices are similar to those for naming
files. The OS/2 operating system has reserved certain names for character
devices supported by the base device drivers. These device names are listed
below:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
CLOCK$<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Clock<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>COM1-COM4<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> First through fourth serial ports
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CON<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Console keyboard and screen<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>KBD$<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Keyboard<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>LPT1<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> First parallel printer<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>LPT2<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Second parallel printer<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>LPT3<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Third parallel printer<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>MOUSE$<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Mouse<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>NUL<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Nonexistent (dummy) device<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>POINTER$<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Pointer draw device (mouse screen
support)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>PRN<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> The default printer, usually LPT1<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>SCREEN$<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Screen<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These names can be used with DosOpen to open the corresponding devices.
Reserved device names take precedence over file names; DosOpen checks for
a device name before checking for a file name. Do not use a file name which
is the same as a reserved device name; the file will never be opened, because
the command will open the device instead.
<P>
COM1 through COM4 are reserved device names only when the ASYNC (RS-232C)
device driver is loaded. The same is true for POINTER$ and MOUSE$, which
are reserved only when a mouse device driver is loaded.
<P>
An application can call DosQueryFHState to verify that a file or device
has been opened. See <A HREF="920_L3_DeterminingandSettin.html">Determining
and Setting the State of a File or Device Handle</A> for more information
on getting the state of a file handle.
