<H1>Supported Bit Rates on 16450 and Compatibles</H1><!-- entering slot 996 -->
<P>
The NS 16450 and other compatible UART devices (including the 8250- and
16550-Series UARTs) incorporate a Programmable Baud Generator feature that
is driven as a function of the following constants:
<PRE>컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
</PRE>

<PRE>
    CLOCK     = 1843200    ; crystal frequency
    CLOCK/16  = 115200     ; after divider

</PRE>

<PRE>컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
</PRE>

<P>
Given these constants, the algorithm for determining which rates are supported
is explained in the following examples:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If 900 bps is specified, the bit rate is exactly 900
because it divides evenly into 115200 (115200/900 = 128). Bit rate, returned
by IOCtl <A HREF="1122_L3_ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE61h.html">ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE</A>,
is 900.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If 901 bps is specified, the bit rate does not change,
and the IOCtl fails with an invalid parameter error because it cannot be
supported within .01% (115200/901 = 128, 115200/128 = 900, which gives a
.1111% error).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If 907 bps is specified, the bit rate is 907.0866
because it can be supported within .01% (115200/907 = 127, 115200/127 =
907.0866, which gives a .0095% error). Bit rate, returned by <A HREF="1122_L3_ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE61h.html">ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE</A>,
is 907.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If 110 bps is specified, the bit rate is 110.0287,
even though the error is over .01% (115200/110 = 1047, 115200/1047 = 110.0287,
which gives a .0260% error). Bit rate, returned by <A HREF="1122_L3_ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE61h.html">ASYNC_GETBAUDRATE</A>,
is 110.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Where division is performed and the quotient is not a whole
integer, an integer result is obtained by rounding off the fractional part
of the quotient.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
