<P>
Debugging is the process of detecting, diagnosing, and eliminating errors
in programs. A debugger application is designed to interact with and control
the application that it is debugging. Because of the protected mode architecture
of OS/2, special steps must be taken to enable a debugger application to
perform its functions in the application being debugged (for example, to
examine and manipulate memory locations in the address space of another
process).
