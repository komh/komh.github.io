<H1>Asynchronous (RS232-C) Communications Physical Device Driver</H1><!-- entering slot 988 -->
<P>
The Asynchronous Communications (ASYNC) device driver enables OS/2 applications
to utilize the Serial Communications (RS232-C) device hardware. The physical
device driver allows an application program in OS/2 session to support duplex
communications while the device driver:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Services the RS232-C port in an interrupt-driven manner
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides transmit and receive queues<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides different automatic control modes for the
modem control signals<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides logical data stream flow control (XON/XOFF)
for transmit and receive operations<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The user will normally want to use the physical ASYNC device driver either
in conjunction with the spooler (for serial printers only) or with an application
program that uses the RS232-enabling capabilities of the physical ASYNC
device driver coupled with a serial device attached to the system.
<P>
The user installs the physical ASYNC device driver by adding a DEVICE= statement
to the CONFIG.SYS file.
