<H1>Using IOCtl Functions to Access Devices</H1><!-- entering slot 793 -->
<P>
Many OS/2 functions communicate with devices. Usually, this communication
is transparent to the application (the application has no knowledge of how
the communication actually occurs). At times, however, an application requires
more direct access to a device. To accommodate this need, OS/2 furnishes
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC -->DosDevIOCtl</A>. Applications can
use<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 2D --> DosDevIOCtl</A> to send commands
and data to a device driver; the device driver interprets these commands
and sends the appropriate instructions to the physical device.
<P>
As an example, some devices have several operating modes. A communications
port can operate at one of a number of bit rates and have several data-word
formats. The actual commands to set these parameters might vary, depending
on the communications hardware.
<P>
Named constants have been defined for the categories, functions, and commands
that are passed to a device driver, to make it easier for application programmers
to use<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC --> DosDevIOCtl</A>. These named
constants are defined in the file BSEDEV.H. This file must be included in
your application when you use the constants. This file also contains data
structure definitions for the parameter and data packets commonly used with
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC -->DosDevIOCtl</A>. The following examples
use the communications port to demonstrate how<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 2D --> DosDevIOCtl
</A>works.
