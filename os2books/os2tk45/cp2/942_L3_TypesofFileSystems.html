<H1>Types of File Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 965 -->
<P>
The OS/2 operating system has two file systems: the<I> file allocation table
(FAT) file system</I> and the<I> high performance file system</I> (HPFS).
These file systems define how information is organized on the storage devices.

<P>
A user can choose to install either or both file systems. An application
must be able to work with any file system. The OS/2 operating system provides
a common set of file system functions that are not dependent on a particular
file system.
<P>
Both of these file systems support:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Existing logical file and directory structure<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Existing naming conventions<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multiple logical volumes (partitions)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multiple and different storage devices<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Redirection or connection to remote file systems<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Extended attributes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Metacharacter file-name processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Additionally, HPFS supports:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Long file names<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An
extendable application interface.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The High Performance File System is an example of a class of file systems
called<I> installable file systems</I>. Installable file systems are installed
by the user (by changing CONFIG.SYS) and are loaded by the operating system
during system initialization.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system permits users to have multiple file systems active
at the same time; for example a FAT file system for one hard disk and HPFS
for another.
