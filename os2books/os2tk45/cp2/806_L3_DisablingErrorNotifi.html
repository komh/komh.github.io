<H1>Disabling Error Notification</H1><!-- entering slot 823 -->
<P>
A hard error is typically an error (such as the opening of a disk-drive
door while a diskette is being read, or any similar kind of device error)
that cannot be resolved by software. When a hard error occurs, the system
default action is to prompt for user input by displaying a message in a
pop-up window.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C3 21 -->DosError</A> disables the default
action, foregoing the displayed message and causing an appropriate return
value to be returned to whichever control-program function was running when
the hard error occurred. The application must determine the appropriate
response by referring to the return value.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C3 21 -->DosError</A> also enables the application
to disable end-user notification if either a program exception or an untrapped
numeric-processor exception occurs. However, if one of these exceptions
occurs while user notification is disabled, the application will still be
ended.
<P>
As with hard errors, the system default is that user notification for these
exceptions is enabled.
