<H1>File Handles</H1><!-- entering slot 922 -->
<P>
OS/2 identifies each open file by assigning it a file handle when the application
opens or creates the file. The file handle is a unique 32-bit integer. The
application can use the handle in functions that read from and write to
the file, depending on how the file was opened. The application can continue
to use the handle until the file is closed.
<P>
The default maximum number of file handles for a process is 50. An application
can change this maximum by using<A><!-- external link: 1D EE C3 FC --> DosSetMaxFH</A>.
When this call is made, all currently open file handles are preserved.
<P>
In the past, the maximum number of file handles was 20. If you previously
had code that increased the maximum file handles from 20 to less than 50,
you can now remove this code.
<P>
When an application starts, it inherits all open file handles from the process
that starts it. If the system's command processor starts an application,
file handles 0, 1, and 2 represent the standard input, standard output,
and standard error files. The standard input file is the keyboard; the standard
output and standard error files are the screen. An application can read
from the standard input file and write to the standard output and standard
error files immediately; it does not have to open the files first.
<P>
An application can create a duplicate file handle for an open file by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C3 FC -->DosDupHandle</A>. A duplicate handle
is identical to the original handle. Typically, duplicate handles are used
to redirect the standard input and standard output files. For example, an
application can open a disk file and duplicate the disk-file handle as handle
0. Thereafter, an application reading from the standard input file (handle
0) takes data from the disk file, not from the keyboard.
<P>
When devices and pipes are accessed through the file system functions (using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC -->DosOpen</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>,
and so on), the devices and pipes are treated as files and are identified
using file handles. The standard file handles can be redirected to a device
or pipe.
