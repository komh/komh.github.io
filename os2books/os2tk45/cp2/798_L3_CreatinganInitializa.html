<H1>Creating an Initialization/Termination Function</H1><!-- entering slot 812 -->
<P>
It might be necessary for a DLL to perform some tasks before an application
accesses a DLL or after an application finishes accessing a DLL.  For example,
the library might need to allocate a heap or open a device prior to using
a DLL, or deallocate a heap or close a device after using a DLL.  You can
handle these tasks in an initialization/termination function.  The initialization/termination
function can be called to perform initialization tasks when the DLL is first
loaded or each time a new process accesses the DLL, depending on the LIBRARY
statement in the module-definition file.  If you specify INITGLOBAL in the
LIBRARY statement, the initialization/termination function is called only
once, when the DLL is first loaded into memory.  This is the default setting.
 If you specify INITINSTANCE, the library function is called each time the
DLL is accessed by a new process.  In the same way, the initialization/termination
function can be called on to perform termination tasks. If you specify TERMINSTANCE,
the library function is called each time the DLL is freed for each process
that accesses the DLL.
<P>
When a thread calls DosLoadModule to load a DLL, the initialization routines
of the loaded DLL (and the initialization routines of the DLLs that it loads)
will run on the thread that called DosLoadModule. This initialization will
complete before DosLoadModule returns.
<P>
The prototype for the _DLL_InitTerm function is:
<P>

<PRE>unsigned long _DLL_InitTerm (unsigned long modhandle, unsigned long flag);
</PRE>

<P>
If the value of the<I> flag</I> parameter is 0, the DLL environment is initialized.
 If the value of the<I> flag</I> parameter is 1, the DLL environment is
ended.  The<I> modhandle</I> parameter is the module handle assigned by
OS/2 for this DLL.  The module handle can be used as a parameter to various
OS/2 API calls. For example, DosQueryModuleName can be used to return the
fully-qualified path name of the DLL, which tells you where the DLL was
loaded from.
<P>
The return code from _DLL_InitTerm tells the loader whether the initialization
or termination was performed successfully.  If the call was successful,
_DLL_InitTerm returns a nonzero value.  A return code of 0 indicates that
the function failed.  If a failure is indicated, the loader will not load
the program that is accessing the DLL.
<P>
Before you can call any C library functions, you must first initialize the
C run-time environment.  To initialize the environment, use the function
_CRT_init.  The prototype for this function is:
<P>

<PRE>int _CRT_init (void);
</PRE>

<P>
If the run-time environment is successfully initialized, _CRT_init returns
0.  A return code of -1 indicates an error.  If an error occurs, an error
message is written to file handle 2, which is the usual destination of stderr.

<P>
To properly terminate the C run-time environment, use the function, _CRT_term.
 The prototype for this function is:
<P>

<PRE>void _CRT_term (unsigned long)
</PRE>

<P>
Because _DLL_InitTerm is called by OS/2, it must be compiled using the system
linkage.  In the IBM C Set/2 compiler, the following #pragma directive is
used to specify the system linkage:
<P>

<PRE>#pragma linkage (_DLL_InitTerm, system)
</PRE>

<P>
The initialization/termination function must have a specific entry point.
 You cannot create a function with a specific entry point in the C programming
language, so the initialization function must be written in assembly language.
 However, you can write a very simple initialization function in assembly
language and have it immediately jump to a C function. The following figure
shows an Assembler language initialization function entry point.

<P>
The following figure shows a sample initialization/termination function
written in C.  This code was written using the IBM C Set/2 compiler.  If
you use another compiler, some of the #pragmas or keywords might need to
be changed.

You also can write the initialization/termination function entirely in assembly
language, without jumping to a C function.  For this case, the library initialization
registers are defined as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<B>Note: </B> All 32-bit protected memory library modules will be given
a GDT selector in the DS and ES registers (ProtDS) that addresses the full
linear address space available to an application.  This selector should
be saved by the initialization routine.  Non-protected memory library modules
will receive a selector (FlatDS) that addresses the same amount of linear
address space as an application's EXE file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

A 32-bit library can specify that its entry point address is the 16-bit
object code.  In this case, the entry registers are the same as for entry
to a library using the segmented EXE format.  This means that a 16-bit library
can be relinked to take advantage of the benefits of the linear EXE format
(such as more efficient paging).
