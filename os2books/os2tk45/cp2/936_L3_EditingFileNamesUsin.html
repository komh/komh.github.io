<H1>Editing File Names Using Metacharacters</H1><!-- entering slot 959 -->
<P>
Metacharacters in a source name simply match files and behave just like
any other search metacharacter.
<P>
Metacharacters in a target name are copy-edit commands and work as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A question mark (?) copies one character unless the
character it would copy is a period (.), in which case it copies 0 characters.
It also copies 0 characters if it is at the end of the source string.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An asterisk (*) copies characters from the source
name to the target name until it finds a source character that matches the
character following it in the target.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A period (.) in the target name causes the source
pointer to match the corresponding "." in the target. They count from the
left.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Editing is case-insensitive. If a case conflict between the source and editing
string arises, the case in the editing string is used, thus:
<PRE>    copy file.txt *E.tmp</PRE>

<P>
results in file.txt being copied as filE.tmp.
<P>
DosEditName provides applications with the ability to transform a file object
name into another name, using an editing string that contains global characters.
