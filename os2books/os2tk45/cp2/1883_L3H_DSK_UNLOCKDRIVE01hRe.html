<P>
This function releases a lock on a volume in a drive, thereby allowing I/O
from other processes to that volume again.  The locked volume represented
by the file handle on which this function is issued, must be in the drive.

<P>
Notice that this function must be called after accessing a drive that was
locked with  <A HREF="1869_L3_DSK_LOCKDRIVE00hLock.html">DSK_LOCKDRIVE</A> before
closing the drive with DosClose.
