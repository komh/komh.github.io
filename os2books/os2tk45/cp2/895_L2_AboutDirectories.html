<H1>About Directories</H1><!-- entering slot 916 -->
<P>
When an application starts, it inherits the current directory and drive
from the application that starts it. An application can determine which
directory and drive are current by using<A><!-- external link: 1D BC C3 1E --> DosQueryCurrentDir
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D BD C3 FC --> DosQueryCurrentDisk</A>. An
application can change the current directory and drive of the file system
by using<A><!-- external link: 1D E3 C3 20 --> DosSetCurrentDir</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D E5 C3 FC -->DosSetDefaultDisk</A>.
<P>
When an application creates a new file, the system adds a file entry to
the specified directory. Each directory can have any number of entries,
up to the physical limit of the disk. An application can create new directories
and delete existing directories by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 1A --> DosCreateDir
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC --> DosDeleteDir</A>. Before a
directory can be deleted, it must be empty; if there are files or directories
in that directory, they must be deleted or moved. An application can delete
a file by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C3 1B --> DosDelete</A> or move
a file to another directory by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9E C3 FC --> DosMove</A>.
