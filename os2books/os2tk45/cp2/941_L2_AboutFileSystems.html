<H1>About File Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 964 -->
<P>
A file system is the combination of software and hardware that supports
storing information on a storage device. In the OS/2 operating system, the
file system specifies how data is organized on the mass storage devices
of the computer, such as hard disks and floppy disks.
<P>
Each drive is assigned a unique letter to distinguish it from other drives.
A single hard disk can also be divided into two or more<I> logical drives</I>.
A logical drive represents a portion of the hard disk and, like a physical
drive, is assigned a unique letter to distinguish it from other physical
and logical drives.
<P>
The file system organizes disks into volumes, directories, and files. A
volume is the largest file system unit. It represents all the available
storage on the logical drive. An optional volume name identifies the volume.

<P>
Volumes are subdivided into directories, which contain files and other subdirectories.
Each volume has a root directory, which contains file and directory entries.
All other subdirectories trace their ancestry back to the root directory.
Each directory entry identifies the name, location, and size of a specific
file or subdirectory on the disk. A file is one or more bytes of data stored
on the disk. Subdirectories provide an additional level of organization
and, like the root directory, can contain files and directory entries.
<P>
The file system also enables users and applications to access certain non-disk
devices as if they were files. An example of such a device would be the
printer, which can be accessed through the file system by using the printer's
logical name, PRN, as a file name.
