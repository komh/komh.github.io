<P>
The device driver does not provide any capabilities of event notification.
For example, the only way for an application to know that RI changed state
or that a Break condition occurred is to poll that status with the IOCtl
<A HREF="1212_L3_ASYNC_GETCOMMEVENT72.html">ASYNC_GETCOMMEVENT</A>. This
should not be a problem for those applications that can use the automatic
control modes of the physical device driver during the course of a communications
dialog (for time-critical control functions). Polling could be adequate
for non-time-critical event monitoring.
