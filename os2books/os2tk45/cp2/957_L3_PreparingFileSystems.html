<P>
At any time during normal system operation, data destined for a disk might
be in a cache. If this information is not written to disk before the system
powered-off, the disk can become corrupted. To prevent this, applications
call<A><!-- external link: 1D F9 C3 36 --> DosShutdown</A> to ensure that
the operating system writes the data in the cache to the disk and prevents
any further data from being cached. The user can then safely power-off the
system.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This call prepares all file systems and device drivers for
system shutdown. Therefore, it must be called only when system shutdown
is about to occur. The user and applications will no longer have access
to their storage devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The following code fragment locks out changes to all file systems, and writes
system buffers to the disk in preparation for turning off power to the system.

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    ULONG   ulReserved;   /* Reserved, must be zero        */
    APIRET  ulrc;         /* Return code                   */

    ulReserved = 0;       /* Reserved, must be set to zero */

    ulrc = DosShutdown(ulReserved);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosShutdown error: return code = %ld", ulrc);
        return;
    }
