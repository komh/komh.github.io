<H1>Output Handshaking Using CTS, DSR, DCD</H1><!-- entering slot 1024 -->
<P>
This mode of the physical device driver can be controlled independently
for each modem control signal. When this mode is enabled, the physical device
driver does not give data to the transmit hardware if the modem control
signals are OFF (disabled). Data is not transmitted unless all the lines
enabled for output handshaking are up.
<P>
If one of these modes is enabled, Error Alerts might be generated when the
OS/2 Logging Facility is enabled. If an external device causes CTS, DCD,
or DSR to become inactive, transmission is blocked while the device driver
waits for the respective line to become active again. If the line does not
become active before the Write Timeout period expires, an Error Alert is
generated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Initial Value<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Output handshaking using CTS and DSR
is enabled. Output handshaking using DCD is disabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> No effect.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Mode
Utility<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> User interface to enable/disable this mode
of the physical device driver for CTS and DSR (independently). Mode always
disables this mode of operation of the physical device driver for DCD.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Automatic
Override<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> When Output Handshaking using DSR, CTS,
or DCD is enabled, the physical device driver responds to the dropping modem
line within a single character time. That is, Automatic Protocol Override
controls the Extended Hardware Buffering capability so that only one character
at a time is given to the transmit hardware (Transmit Buffer Load Count
is set to 1). The Receive Trigger Level is unaffected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
