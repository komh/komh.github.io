<P>
This function is supported by the physical screen device driver.  A 32-bit
physical address and 16-bit length are passed to the device driver.  The
physical device driver returns an LDT selector and offset for that area
of memory.
<P>
Read/Write access is granted to any data areas completely contained in the
range of addresses from A0000 to BFFFF.  Read-Only access is granted for
all other data areas completely contained in the range of addresses from
00000 to FFFFF.  Requests for any other data areas result in a return code
of ERROR_I24_INVALID_PARAMETER.
