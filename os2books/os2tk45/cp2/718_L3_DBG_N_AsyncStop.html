<B>Debug Notification -11 - Asynchronous Stop Notification</B>
<P>
This notification returns:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>

Cmd<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= DBG_N_AsyncStop<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Value<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

</UL>
<P>
An Asynchronous Stop request has been detected.
<P>
The asynchronous stop command is used to get the attention of some debuggee
thread, so that the debugger can again control the process. Because any
notification results in the debuggee's coming under control of the debugger
again, the asynchronous stop notification becomes redundant in that case,
and is not returned.
<P>
The asynchronous stop request will be overridden and ignored if another
notification can be performed instead, at the same time. An asynchronous
stop notification never becomes a "pending" notification, in the sense that
a library load notification becomes pending.
