<H1>Classifying Return Values</H1><!-- entering slot 822 -->
<P>
When a control-program function has been successfully completed, a return
value of 0 is returned to the calling thread. A non-zero return value indicates
that an error has occurred.
<P>
Each non-zero value corresponds to a symbolic error identifier that indicates
the cause of the error. For example, a return value of 2 from<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 1D --> DosOpen
</A>(indicating that the file was not found) corresponds to the symbolic
identifier ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 81 C3 1C -->DosErrClass</A> helps applications
deal with non-zero return values by taking a return value as input and returning
both an error classification and a recommended action. Depending on the
application, the recommended action could be followed, or a more specific
recovery routine could be executed.
