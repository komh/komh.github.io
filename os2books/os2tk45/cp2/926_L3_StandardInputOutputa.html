<H1>Standard Input, Output, and Error File Handles</H1><!-- entering slot 949 -->
<P>
As OS/2 starts an application, it automatically opens the three standard
files and makes the file handles-numbered 0, 1, and 2-available to the application.
Applications can read from and write to the standard files as soon as they
start.
<P>
<B>Standard Input</B>
<BR>
File handle 0 is the standard input file. This handle can be used to read
characters from the keyboard with<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>.
The function reads the specified number of characters unless the user types
a<I> turnaround character</I>-that is, a character that marks the end of
a line (the default turnaround character is a carriage-return/linefeed character
pair).
<P>

<P>
As<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 39 --> DosRead</A> reads the characters,
it copies them to the buffer you have supplied, as shown in the code fragment
below.
<P>
In this example,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 39 --> DosRead</A> copies
the number of characters read from standard input to to variable<I> cbRead</I>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 39 -->DosRead also copies the turnaround
character, or characters, to the buffer</A> If the function reads fewer
than 80 characters, the turnaround character is the last one in the buffer.

<P>
<B>Standard Output</B>
<BR>
File handle 1 is the standard output file. This handle can be used to write
characters on the screen with<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.
The function writes the characters in the given buffer to the current line.
If you want to start a new line, you must place the current turnaround character
in the buffer.

             &amp;ulWritten);

<P>
<B>Standard Error</B>
<BR>
File handle 2 is the standard error file. This handle, like the standard
output handle, enables applications to write characters on the screen. Most
applications use the standard error file to display error messages, enabling
the application to redirect standard output to a file without also redirecting
error messages to the file.
