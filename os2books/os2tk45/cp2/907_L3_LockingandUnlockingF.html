<P>
Because OS/2 permits more than one application to open a file and write
to it, it is important that the applications not write over each other's
work. An application can protect against this problem by temporarily locking
a region in a file.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D EA C3 2E -->DosSetFileLocks</A> provides a simple
mechanism that temporarily prevents access by other processes to regions
within a file. DosSetFileLocks specifies a range of bytes in the file that
is locked by an application and that can be accessed only by the application
locking the region. The application uses the same function to free the locked
region.
<P>
Locking and unlocking regions in a file enables sharing processes to coordinate
their efforts. A process can lock a region in a file so the process can
read and update the file region. A sharing process that attempts to lock
the region before the other process finishes its update and unlocks the
region receives an error code. When a lock is unsuccessful because a lock
is already in place, ERROR_LOCK_VIOLATION is returned.
<P>
A lock that extends beyond end-of-file is not considered an error. However,
a locked region cannot overlap another locked region, nor can it encompass
a locked region. Any such conflicting locks must be cleared before a region
can be locked.
<P>
When a file handle is duplicated, the duplicate handle has access to any
locked regions currently being accessed by the original handle. Although
a child process created with<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 2D --> DosExecPgm
</A>can inherit the file handles of its parent process, it does not inherit
access to locked regions in effect for a file handle unless the file handle
is duplicated and passed to it.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> File locks are intended to be in effect for only short periods
of time.
<P>
When a file with locks is closed, the locks are released in no defined order.
