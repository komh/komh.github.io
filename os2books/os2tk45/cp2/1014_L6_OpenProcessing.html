<P>
The physical device driver does not claim the interrupt level the port is
on until the port is open. If the interrupt level is not available, the
OPEN request packet fails. The interrupt level is claimed exclusively on
the ISA bus machines. The interrupt level is claimed shareable on the Micro
Channel architecture machines.
<P>
On PS/2 machines, a First Level Open causes the physical device driver to
attempt to obtain a Logical ID. If this fails (which indicates another physical
device driver might be using the device), a general failure is returned.
If the Logical ID is obtained, but the open fails for some other reason,
the Logical ID is freed. Other physical device drivers that coexist with
the OS/2 physical ASYNC device driver perform similar processing.
<P>
If a timer tick handler is not available during First Level Open processing,
the Open request can fail. If the physical device driver receives an OPEN
request packet and the COM device is not already open (from a previous open
without a close), this is called a<I> First Level Open</I>, and the physical
device driver does special processing. See <A HREF="981_L4_StatesoftheASYNCDevi.html">States
of the ASYNC Device Driver</A>. If a subsequent Open request is issued before
a previous First Level Open request has completed, the device driver might
process the OPEN request packets in an order different from the one in which
they were issued. This could cause the First Level Open to take effect at
a time different from what the application expected.
<P>
An Open request should never be issued until a previous Last Level Close
request has completed. Otherwise, the function performed by a Last Level
Close and a First Level Open might not occur. If the port is not already
open (First Level Open), the physical device driver attempts to clear out
any data in the<I> receive</I> hardware. On the IBM PS/2 system, if the
port is not already open (First Level Open), the physical device driver
relies on the<I> Reset/Initialize</I> Advanced BIOS function to reset and
clear the UART receive hardware.
