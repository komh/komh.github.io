<H1>Using the Debugging Function</H1><!-- entering slot 677 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 54 -->DosDebug</A>  provides a set of commands
that permit one process to control another process for debugging.
<P>
In the following code fragment, the calling process uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 54 --> DosDebug
</A> to modify a word in a controlled process. All the necessary steps have
already been taken so that the calling process controls the second process-the
process identifier of the controlled process has been placed into<I> PID</I>,
the address of the word to be modified in the controlled process has been
placed into<I> Addr</I>, and the value to be substituted in the controlled
process has been placed into<I> Value</I>.
<P>
(Due to the size of the<I> debug_buffer</I> data structure, the code fragment
has been divided into two figures. If you were actually entering this into
a program, the information would be together as if it were all one figure.)

<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</PRE>

<P>
The<I> Cmd</I> field in the debug buffer is used for two purposes. On input,
the<I> Cmd</I> field is used to pass the commands that direct<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> DosDebug</A>'s
activities. On output, the<I> Cmd</I> field is used by<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 26 --> DosDebug
</A>to return a notification indicating the events and activities that occurred
during the call.
<P>
If<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 26 --> DosDebug</A> returns no error,
a notification resides in the<I> Cmd</I> field of the debug buffer. The
data returned with the notification varies, depending on the command passed
in the<I> Cmd</I> field of the debug buffer data structure when<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 26 --> DosDebug
</A>was called.
<P>
Not all fields in the debug buffer have to be defined on every<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 26 --> DosDebug
</A> command. The same field can have a different meaning in different<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 26 --> DosDebug
</A>commands.
<P>
Some notifications (such as DBG_N_ModuleLoad and DBG_N_NewProc) might require
multiple returns to the debugger. These additional, pending notifications
will be returned before the process being debugged is permitted to execute
any more user code, and will be returned on the Go, Single Step, or Stop
commands.
<P>
Additional notifications can be pending at any time, so a debugger must
be ready to handle any notification any time a Go, Single Step, or Stop
command is called.
