<H1>Extended Attribute Naming Conventions</H1><!-- entering slot 890 -->
<P>
Because many applications use text, bit maps, and other binary data in extended
attributes, standard names have been adopted to help identify these formats.
An application is not limited to these Standard Extended Attributes but
should use them when many applications will be accessing the same data.

<P>
Standard Extended Attributes (SEAs) have a dot (.) as a prefix. This identifies
the extended attribute as a SEA. The leading dot is reserved, so applications
should not define extended attributes that start with a dot. Also, extended
attributes that start with the characters $, @, &amp;, or + are reserved
for system use.
<P>
To ensure that its extended attributes are unique, an application should
use the name of the company and the name of the application (or suitable
abbreviations of each) as a prefix for application-specific extended attributes.

<P>
For example, Company A has an OS/2 Application, B, that defines extended
attributes STUFF, MORE_STUFF, and STILL_MORE_STUFF for its file objects.
The names of these extended attributes could be represented by the following
entry:
<PRE>    AB.STUFF   AB.MORE_STUFF   AB.STILL_MORE_STUFF

</PRE>
