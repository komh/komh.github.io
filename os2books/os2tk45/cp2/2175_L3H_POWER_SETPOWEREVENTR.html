<P>

<P>
A set of Power Management resources is allocated when an application calls
this IOCtl. This resource set consists of a queue that holds Power Management
event messages. Only one resource set (event queue) can be created per file
handle.
<P>
If a semaphore is established, the caller is notified (that is, the semaphore
is cleared) each time a Power Management event message is added to the queue.
It is the responsibility of the calling application to reset the semaphore.
Because different applications might be interested in different event messages,
<I>EventMask</I> can be tailored to specify only those event messages the
application is interested in processing. The resource set is freed when
DosClose is performed on the associated file handle.
<P>
If the resource set is defined without a semaphore, the IOCtl 61h interface
must be polled to determine whether any events have occurred (that is, if
any event messages are in the queue).
<P>
If a SemRemoval request (Bit 1 is set) attempts to release a semaphore with
a bad handle, or to release a handle to a semaphore that is different from
the handle provided in the SemSetup request (bit set to 0), then PowerBadSemHandle
is referenced in the<I> ReturnCode</I> field.
<P>
When a semaphore handle has been provided, all subsequent Setup requests
for that resource set fail with a ReturnCode value of PowerSemAlreadySetup
unless a corresponding SemRemoval request has been processed.
<P>
If an input semaphore handle value is rejected by the DevHlp semaphore management
functions, the request fails with a ReturnCode value of PowerBadSemaphore.
