<UL> The physical device
driver returns this information if a general failure error is not returned
to the application. See the <A HREF="1204_L3_ASYNC_GETCOMMERROR6D.html">ASYNC_GETCOMMERROR
</A>for COMERR definition.  The COM device error information is not cleared
by this action.  At device driver initialization, the device driver turns
<I>off</I> DTR and RTS for the COM devices that it owns.
<P>
When the COM device is not already open (from a previous Open without a
Close), the OPEN request packet causes DTR and RTS to be set according to
the DTR Control mode and the RTS Control mode.  See Note 1 of <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the port will not be open after processing a CLOSE request
packet (Last Level Close), DTR and RTS are turned<I> off</I> by the device
driver.  This occurs after the transmit hardware has completely transmitted
(at the physical RS232 interface) all the data that it has been given by
the physical device driver and time for at least 10 additional character
transmissions has elapsed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
