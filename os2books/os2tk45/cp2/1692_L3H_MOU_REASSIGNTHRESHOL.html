<P>
For each mouse event, the count of physical units moved is compared against
the 1st and 2nd level thresholds. If the count is greater than the 2nd level
threshold, the 2nd level multiplier will be used; if the count is greater
than the 1st level but less than the 2nd level, the 1st level multiplier
will be used. If the count is less than the 1st level threshold, no multiplier
will be used. These calculations are done separately for the X- and Y-axis.
