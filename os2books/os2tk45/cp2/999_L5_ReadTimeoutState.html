<P>
When the physical device driver processes a READ request packet, it can
be with Normal, No-Wait, or Wait-For-Something Timeout processing. With
<I>Normal</I> Timeout processing, if no data is received in the specified
period of time, the request is completed. With<I> No-Wait</I> Timeout processing,
the request obtains whatever data is available in the physical device driver
receive queue (at the time the request is processed by the device driver)
and returns. With<I> Wait-For-Something</I> Timeout processing, the request
acts like No-Wait Timeout processing. However, if no data is available when
the device driver processes the request, the physical device driver waits
until some data is available or until the request times out due to Normal
Timeout processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
