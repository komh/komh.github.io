<H1>About Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 883 -->
<P>
<I>Level 1 file information</I> is the basic information describing files
that is stored by the file system. Level 1 file information includes the
size of the file, and the date and time it was created, last written, and
last accessed. A subset of this information is typically displayed by entering
the DIR command on the OS/2 command line. Applications can obtain Level
1 file information by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C3 4E --> DosQueryPathInfo
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C3 FC --> DosQueryFileInfo</A>. Applications
can set Level 1 File Information by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F2 C3 50 --> DosSetPathInfo
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D E9 C3 FC --> DosSetFileInfo</A>.
<P>
Applications can attach additional information to a file object in the form
of an<I> extended attribute</I> (EA). Extended attributes can be used to
describe the file object to another application, to OS/2, and to the file
system that is managing that object.
<P>
This information can be used to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Store notes on file objects (for example, the name
of the file creator)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Categorize file objects (for example, source, samples,
icons, bit maps)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Describe the format of data contained in the file
object (for example, a data record)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Append additional data to the file object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application uses extended attributes to provide a description of a file
or directory but the application does not place the description in the file
or directory itself. Extended attributes associated with a file object are
not part of the file object or its data. They are stored separately from
the file they are linked to and the file system manages the storage and
maintenance of the EA.
<P>
Each extended attribute has two parts, a name and a value. The name is a
NULL-terminated string; any convenient name can be chosen. EA names are
restricted to the same character set as file names.
<P>
The value of the EA can be text, a bit map, binary data, anything at all.
OS/2 does not check data that is associated with an EA. The application
that creates the extended attributes and the applications that read them
must recognize the format and meaning of the data associated with a given
EA name.
<P>
Applications can examine, add, and replace extended attributes at any time.
Any application can read the extended attributes by using the<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C3 4D --> DosQueryFileInfo
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C3 4E --> DosQueryPathInfo</A> function.
Applications can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 4A --> DosFindFirst
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 4B --> DosFindNext</A> to search
for files that have specific extended attributes.
<P>
A file can have any number of extended attributes. Each extended attribute
can be up to 64KB  in size. The sum of all extended attributes for a file
must not exceed 64KB.
<P>
So that extended attribute data can be understood by other applications,
conventions have been established for naming EAs and indicating the type
of data they contain.
<P>
In addition, a set of Standard Extended Attributes (SEAs) have been defined.
SEAs define a common set of information that can be associated with most
files (for example, file type and file purpose). Through SEAs, many applications
can access the same, useful information associated with files.
<P>
Applications are not limited to using SEAs to associate information with
files. They can define their own application-specific extended attributes.

<P>
Extended attributes associated with a file object are not part of the file
object or its data.
<P>
Extended attributes are supported by the OS/2 High Performance File System
(HPFS) and by the OS/2 FAT file system.
<P>
Applications define and associate extended attributes with a file object
through file system functions. The file system functions that use and manipulate
EAs are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
