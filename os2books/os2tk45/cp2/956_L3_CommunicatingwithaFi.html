<H1>Communicating with a File System</H1><!-- entering slot 980 -->
<P>
An extended standard interface between an application and a file system
driver is provided by<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> DosFSCtl</A>.
This function is similar to DosDevIOCtl, which provides a standard interface
between an application and a device driver. An application sends a request
to the file system driver by specifying a particular function code. Data
is exchanged through data areas and parameter lists.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 4C -->DosFSCtl</A> can be used to establish
open connections to file system drivers that are not attached to a name
in the operating system's name space. (A name space is a set of names that
are known to the file system. For example, CON and PRN are always in the
OS/2 file system's name space.)
<P>
The following code fragment demonstrates how a process can communicate with
a file system driver (FSD). Assume that the calling process has placed an
appropriate file handle into<I> FileHandle</I>. Assume that the specified
file system recognizes a function code of hex 8100, and that the function
code accepts an ASCII string as input, requires no specific command parameter
list, and returns a string of ASCII characters to the caller.

<P>
In this example, the the<I> DataArea</I> buffer is used to store the ASCII
string sent by the file system in response to the function request, and
the<I> DataLengthInOut</I> variable is used to store the number of bytes
placed in the buffer by the file system.
