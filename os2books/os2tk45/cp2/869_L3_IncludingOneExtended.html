<P>
Extended attributes (EA) can contain pointers to data stored in other places.

<P>
This data type indicates that the data contained in another EA associated
with the file object should be included into the current EA.
<P>
For example, the following EA value contains the string "Hello", followed
by the data in the EA named AB.STUFF, followed by the string "Bye".
<PRE>    EA_MVMT 0000 0003 EAT_ASCII 0005  Hello
                      EAT_EA    0008  AB.STUFF
                      EAT_ASCII 0003  Bye

</PRE>
