<H1>DLL Side Effects</H1><!-- entering slot 818 -->
<P>
Dynamic link routines are not processes.  They run on the thread of the
calling process and therefore do not own resources.  Any resource that they
obtain or use is owned by the calling process.  Authors of DLLs should be
careful not to needlessly allocate resources until the resource is required
by the calling process to perform the requested function. They also should
free the resource as soon as that resource is no longer required.
<P>
A dynamic link routine that obtains and uses resources should attempt to
minimize the use of a process's resources.  For example, stack space should
be conserved. If an application redirects file handle 5 and calls a DLL
entry that expects file handle 5 to be an open handle to an associated device
driver, unpredictable results can occur.
<P>
If the routine opens an abundance of file handles, it might consider increasing
the maximum number of file handles, so that the process maximum is not exceeded.
 However, increasing the maximum number of file handles for a process also
increases the maximum number of file handles for all processes created by
the current process.  This will cause additional memory to be consumed and
could cause problems for an application that assumes a limit of 20 file
handles. Also, it should be noted that applications have the ability to
redirect file handles.
<P>
Dynamic link routines also should not make system calls that affect the
calling process environment.  If a DLL changes a process's current directory,
another thread running under the same process could fail a file I/O call
if it assumes a given working directory.
<P>
Applications and DLLs should not make calls to other DLLs, including system
DLLs, within a critical section.  Since DLLs can use semaphores to synchronize
threads within a process or between processes, calling a DLL within a critical
section could cause application deadlocks. This would occur if the DLL requests
a semaphore on behalf of the calling thread and another thread within the
process owns the semaphore.  Because the calling thread is in a critical
section and is the only thread within the process that is permitted to execute,
the semaphore will never be freed, causing a deadlock.
