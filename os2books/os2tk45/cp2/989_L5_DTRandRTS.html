<H1>DTR and RTS</H1><!-- entering slot 1017 -->
<P>
This is the value of the modem control signals Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
and Request To Send (RTS) put out by the communications hardware. Each signal
is controlled independently and can be either ON or OFF. See IOCtls <A HREF="1067_L3_ASYNC_SETMODEMCTRL46.html">ASYNC_SETMODEMCTRL
</A>and <A HREF="1170_L3_ASYNC_GETMODEMOUTPUT.html">ASYNC_GETMODEMOUTPUT</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Initial Value<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> When the physical device driver starts
the port during device driver initialization, their values are turned OFF.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>First Level Open<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The signals
are normally turned ON, but there are many conditions that can cause the
signals to be affected differently. See IOCtls <A HREF="1067_L3_ASYNC_SETMODEMCTRL46.html">ASYNC_SETMODEMCTRL
</A>and <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A> for
a complete explanation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Close Considerations<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> A
Close request packet causes DTR and RTS to be turned OFF after the transmit
hardware has completely transmitted all the data sent by the physical device
driver. After processing this Close request, the port is no longer open
from another OPEN without a CLOSE. In addition, at least 10 additional character
times must have elapsed (or one second, whichever is less).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Mode
Utility<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Not applicable for direct control. Indirect
effects through altering processing modes of the physical device driver
are possible.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
