This function plays the selected audio tracks until the selection is played
or until a Stop Audio command (Category 81h, Function 51h) is received.
 If the ending sector number is reached, or if the end of the disc or the
end of the audio section is reached, the drive will stop playing.  This
is not considered an error.
