If Break Replacement Character Processing is enabled and the device driver
detects a break condition, it places the break replacement character in
the physical device driver receive queue. If Break Replacement Character
Processing is disabled, the physical device driver does not place any character
in the physical device driver receive queue when it detects a break condition.
