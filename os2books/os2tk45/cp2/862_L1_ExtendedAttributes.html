<P>
OS/2 file systems maintain a standard set of information on file objects.
This standard set of information is referred to as<I> Level 1 file information</I>.
Level 1 file information includes the name and size of the file object,
and the date and time the file object was created, last accessed, and last
written to.
<P>
Applications can attach additional information to a file object in the form
of an<I> extended attribute</I> (EA). There can be many EAs associated with
a file object and, because of their flexibility, almost any information
about the file can be stored in one.
