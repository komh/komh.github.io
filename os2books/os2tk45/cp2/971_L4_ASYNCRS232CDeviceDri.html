<H1>ASYNC (RS232-C) Device Driver Features</H1><!-- entering slot 997 -->
<P>
The device driver supports the ASYNC interface in an interrupt-driven manner.
This allows the multitasking capabilities of the OS/2 operating system to
be supported while ASYNC data reception and transmission are taking place.

<P>
<B>Warning:</B> With any supported hardware, the physical device driver
cannot absolutely guarantee accurate function, as there is a dependency
on the hardware being driven. It is known, for example, that INS 8250 and
INS 8250-B UART devices exhibit a number of deviations from their hardware
specifications. In some cases, these deviations have been compensated for
in the physical device driver design. Some of these deviations, however,
cannot be resolved in software. The user must be familiar with the limitations
and restrictions associated with such hardware.
<P>
When data is given to the transmit hardware, it has not yet been physically
transmitted (at the RS232 interface). The data is considered completely
transmitted by the transmit hardware at the physical RS232 interface when
the transmit shift register of the UART is empty. The IOCtl <A HREF="1162_L3_ASYNC_GETLINESTATUS6.html">ASYNC_GETLINESTATUS
</A>can be used to determine this information.
<P>
The device driver<I> transmit</I> queue is a memory buffer between the operating
system and the<I> transmit</I> hardware. The device driver<I> receive</I> queue
is a memory buffer between the operating system and the receive hardware.
Both are considered to be owned by the physical device driver because the
physical device driver controls the data movement in and out of the transmit
and receive queues. Algorithms for this data movement can change between
releases of the physical device driver. Changes in the ASYNC hardware can
cause changes in the data movement algorithms and external interfaces.
<P>
Data that applications send (made available by Write requests) is placed
in the physical device driver transmit queue. When an interrupt occurs to
tell the physical device driver that the hardware is ready for more data,
the driver gives the transmit hardware more data from the transmit queue.

<P>
When an interrupt occurs to tell the physical device driver that the hardware
has received data, that data is placed in the physical device driver receive
queue. When the physical device driver gets a Read request (READ request
packet) from the application, it fills the Read request from the receive
queue.
<P>
At high bit rates, such as 19200 bits-per-second, a serial device supporting
full-duplex asynchronous I/O can generate an interrupt every 260 microseconds
(at 10 bits-per-character and one interrupt-per-character transmitted and
received). This leads to excessive interrupt-time overhead in the multitasking,
interrupt-driven, device driver.
<P>
To address this problem, serial devices with Extended Hardware Buffering
capabilities (FIFO or First-In-First-Out buffers) have been developed. However,
many serially-attached devices that support the RS232-C interface, have
been designed to operate with specific protocols that assume the system
processes all data I/O one character at a time. The ASYNC physical device
driver employs a software mechanism that automatically controls parameters
to utilize the Extended Hardware Buffering capability, while compatibly
supporting devices that use existing ASYNC device driver protocols.
<P>
The Automatic Protocol Override (system default) mode for Extended Hardware
Buffering support partially utilizes only these performance advantages,
while remaining fully compatible with the behavior of existing ASYNC device
driver protocols (for example, Input Sensitivity using DSR). Applications
and subsystems can disable certain device driver default settings in order
to fully use the Extended Hardware Buffering capabilities. This results
in a<!-- entering slot 998 --> significant reduction of serial device interrupt
processing overhead, and greatly increases the aggregate bit rates that
can be supported across multiple active COM ports.
<P>
The size of the receive and transmit queues are available from the following

<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The physical device driver services each communications port independently.
Requests issued to a given port have no effect on any other communications
ports that the physical device driver might be servicing. The physical device
driver processes READ and WRITE request packets independently for a given
port. An application can be written to support simultaneous reception and
transmission of data. In addition, the device driver can process an IOCtl
request simultaneously with outstanding Read and Write requests.
<P>
The physical device driver does not schedule the processing of IOCtl requests.
It processes the IOCtl request when received, regardless of what else it
is doing. This can cause unexpected results if, for instance, the bit rate
is modified while data reception or transmission is taking place. The application
should issue only one IOCtl request at a time. If it issues another IOCtl
request before the first IOCtl request is completed, the results are UNDEFINED.

<P>
The device driver queues multiple READ and WRITE request packets independently
and always begins processing the READ request packets in the order they
are received. It also begins processing the WRITE request packets in the
order they are received.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The operating system does not guarantee that file system requests
will be delivered to a device driver in the order in which they are issued
by an application. This means that a request by one thread can get blocked
in the operating system, thus allowing a subsequent request by a different
thread for the same function (for example, DosWrite) to pass through and
arrive ahead of the first thread at the physical device driver. This is
true for synchronous operations performed by multiple threads or asynchronous
operations performed by the same thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Because of thread-priority considerations and the system dynamics, the order
observed by the application of completing requests of the same type might
not be the order in which they were received by the device driver. The physical
device driver always keeps the data in the same order in which the READ
and WRITE request packets (of the same type) were received. There is no
ordering or timing between different types of request packets.
<P>
The concept of a<I> First Level Open</I> is described in the section on
<A HREF="981_L4_StatesoftheASYNCDevi.html">States of the ASYNC Device Driver</A>.
A First Level Open occurs when the device driver receives an OPEN request
packet for the port and the port is not already open (from a previous open
without a matching close). A CLOSE request packet causing the physical device
driver to process the next OPEN request packet as a First Level Open is
called a<I> Last Level Close</I>. Because the requests that an application
issues sometimes get out of order before they reach the device driver, an
application cannot consider a close a Last Level Close until the CLOSE completes.
If the application issues an Open request to the COM port before a previously
issued Close request is completed, then the results are UNDEFINED.
<P>
A Flush request can be completed before all the appropriate request packets
(which have been queued by the device driver) have been flushed. The appropriate
request packets eventually are flushed and return to the caller, based on
their priority and the system dynamics. Once the Flush request has been
processed, the appropriate request packets do not cause data to be incorrectly
transmitted (or received data to be moved).
<P>
The device driver supports different timeout processing characteristics
and timeout settings for the Read and Write requests. Only the physical
device driver is informed of when a given character is<!-- entering slot 999 --> being
transmitted or received at the hardware interface. Therefore, an application
cannot expect to provide real-time flow control of data (in the middle of
data transmission or reception) based on logical characters (XON/XOFF),
or based on the state of the modem control signals by manually:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<UL>Monitoring the queue status<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Monitoring data moving across the link<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Alternatively, the physical device driver provides optional modes of operation
to control the data flow through the RS232-C port automatically. OS/2 applications
use IOCtls to select which protocols are to be made active.
