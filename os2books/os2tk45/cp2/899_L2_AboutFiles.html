<H1>About Files</H1><!-- entering slot 920 -->
<P>
A file is one or more bytes of data, usually stored on a disk. While the
application that creates the file determines the format of the file, the
file system determines how the file is stored on the disk and what actions
can be performed on it. The file system also stores information about the
file in file attributes and extended attributes.
<P>
Files are accessed through the file system using file handles. File handles
are returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 1C --> DosOpen</A> when the
file is opened and are used for all subsequent accesses to the file. Files
can be be opened, read from, written to, closed, copied, moved, deleted,
renamed, and locked. Files can be searched for based on a metacharacter
template.
<P>
Each open file has a file pointer that indicates the current reading or
writing location within the file. The file pointer moves automatically with
each read or write operation on the file and can be moved manually by the
application.
