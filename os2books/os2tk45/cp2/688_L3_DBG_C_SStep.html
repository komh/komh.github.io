<P>
<B>Debug Command 9 - Single Step Command</B>
<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Process ID of debuggee<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Tid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Thread ID of thread to single-step<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Cmd<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= DBG_C_SStep<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If Tid is zero, all threads will be marked to single-step at once, and the
first thread to be scheduled to execute user-space code will single-step.
No other threads will single-step.
<P>
<B>Returns</B>
<P>
Usually, the <A HREF="714_L3_DBG_N_Exception.html">DBG_N_Exception</A> notification
is returned, but any notification may be returned. See <A HREF="710_L2_DosDebugNotification.html">DosDebug
Notifications</A> for more information.
<P>
Callgates that result in a privilege level transition to ring 0 will appear
to single-step as a single instruction, with the single-step occurring just
after the function completes. This hides ring 0 execution from debuggers.

<P>
Attempting to single-step any thread that is frozen results in an error.

<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
The DBG_C_SStep command has two modes of operation, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If Tid is zero, the current thread is single-stepped
while allowing all other threads to execute.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If Tid is nonzero, a specific thread is selected for
single-stepping. Only that thread is executed, even if it is single-stepping
a kernel function that can potentially cause a deadlock condition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The single-step exception (XCPT_SINGLE_STEP) is not lost if the single-step
operation causes a notification to be sent to<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 FC --> DosDebug</A>.
In this case, the single-step exception is queued.
<P>
The single-step operation is not lost if other notifications were queued
before the DBG_C_SStep command was issued. The Debug <A HREF="705_L3_DBG_C_Continue.html">DBG_C_Continue
</A>command will clear the notifications one at a time until<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 32 --> DosDebug
</A>has been completely notified. On the last <A HREF="705_L3_DBG_C_Continue.html">DBG_C_Continue
</A>command, the single-step operation will take place as originally requested.

<P>
When a single-step operation is interrupted by an exception, the EIP (instruction
pointer) should be moved to the next RING3 instruction. This may be in ring
3 system code. The single-step notification will be issued at this time.

<P>
The DBG_C_SStep command correctly single-steps most instructions. Single-stepping
some REP instructions may not work correctly due to errors in the 80386
processor.
