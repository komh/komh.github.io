<P>
The Workplace Shell supports copying files with long file names to media
that is managed by a non-installable file system (IFS) and for returning
these files to IFS media with the long name intact.
<P>
When a file with a long name is copied to media that does not support long
file names, the Workplace Shell stores the file's long name in the .LONGNAME
extended attribute. When the file is copied back to a disk that does support
long file names, the Workplace Shell restores the long name from the extended
attribute.
<P>
If the new media does not support extended attributes, files that have long
names cannot be moved to the media without having their names modified or
truncated.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The behavior described above only applies to the Workplace
Shell The command processors, CMD.EXE and COMMAND.COM, do not automatically
save the long file name; they require the user to enter a new file name
that is legal on the new media. The DosCopy command also does not save the
long file name automatically; the programmer must provide the target file
name to DosCopy and the target file name must be a legal file name for the
target media.
<P>
If you choose to store and restore the file's long name, you must do it
yourself in the manner described above.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
