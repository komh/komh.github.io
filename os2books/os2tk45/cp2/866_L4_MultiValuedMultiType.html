<H1>Multi-Valued, Multi-Typed Data Type</H1><!-- entering slot 886 -->
<P>
This data type indicates that the value of a single extended attribute (EA)
contains several pieces of information, each of a different data type. It
is formatted as follows:
<PRE>    EAT_MVMT  Codepage  NumEntries  [DataType Data] ...
    WORD      WORD      WORD         WORD

</PRE>

<P>
The first word indicates that the EA value is multi-valued, multi-typed.
The second word indicates the code page associated with the language in
which the EA value is written. The third word indicates the number of entries
contained in this EA value. The next word indicates the data type for the
first entry in this EA value, followed by the data for the first entry.
The next word, if any, indicates the data type for the second entry in this
EA value, followed by the data for the second entry. The pattern repeats-
data type, followed by data-for any remaining entries.
<P>
For example, an extended attribute can have the following value:
<PRE>    EAT_MVMT  0000  0002  EAT_ASCII   000A Hello John
                          EAT_BINARY  0003 0x12 0x21 0x34

</PRE>

<P>
This is a multi-valued extended attribute with two entries, using the default
code page. The first entry is the string "Hello John", and the second is
the binary data 0x12 0x21 0x34.
<P>
Whether or not the data is length-preceded is a function of the data type.
