<B>Debug Command 10 - Stop Command</B>
<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Process ID of debuggee<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Cmd<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= DBG_C_Stop<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Returns</B>
<P>
The function performed by this command depends on the current state of the
debuggee process, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the debuggee is already stopped:
<P>
If there is a pending notification from the current thread, it is returned.
See <A HREF="710_L2_DosDebugNotification.html">DosDebug Notifications</A> for
information about pending notifications.
<P>
If there is no pending notification from the current thread, <A HREF="711_L3_DBG_N_Success.html">DBG_N_Success
</A>is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the debuggee is executing user code:
<P>
The debuggee is marked to stop before the next time it is ready to execute
user-space (ring 2 or 3) code. This is known as an asynchronous stop.
<P>
Kernel operations will not be interrupted for this DBG_C_Stop That is, threads
blocked in the kernel (via a semaphore or internal operation) will not be
interrupted. However, an infinite loop in user space will be stopped.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The asynchronous variation of the stop command implies a debugger
with a minimum of two threads; one waits for a <A HREF="686_L3_DBG_C_Go.html">DBG_C_Go
</A>or <A HREF="688_L3_DBG_C_SStep.html">DBG_C_SStep</A> command to finish,
and another executes the DBG_C_Stop command.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
