<P>
This request is used by the Session Manager to set a list of keyboard hot
keys, searched for by the physical keyboard device driver.  Up to 16 hot
keys can be defined by the Session Manager for handling by the physical
keyboard device driver.  The new hot key is global (that is, it applies
to all sessions).  A hot key can be redefined by calling this function with
the same Hot Key ID.
<P>
The combination of shift flags in the first WORD and scan codes in the second
allows the Session Manager to set hot key combinations such as Alt+Esc.
 The hot key is triggered on detection of the scan code for the hot key
break.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a DOS application has claimed hardware INT 9 or INT 50,
the hot key is triggered on detection of the break scan code for the required
shift key.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
Hot key definition requests that have identical data definitions (shift
state, make, and break scan codes) but different Hot Key IDs result in an
INVALID_PARAMETER error code returned to the caller. Attempts to define
a new or unique hot key when the maximum number is currently active also
result in an INVALID_PARAMETER error code returned to the caller.
<P>
This IOCtl is successful only if performed by the process that initially
invoked it, unless it is called with a Hot Key ID of<I> -1</I>.  A Hot Key
ID with a value of<I> -1</I> acts like a toggle.  The first time a call
is made with<I> -1</I>, the Ctrl+Alt+Del keystrokes are disabled.  The second
time a call is made with<I> -1</I>, the keystroke sequences are enabled.

<P>
The caller of this interface must use caution in the key combinations selected
because hot key definitions become system property, and any resulting characters
normally produced by that key combination will no longer be available to
applications.
