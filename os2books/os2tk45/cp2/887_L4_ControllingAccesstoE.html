<H1>Controlling Access to Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 908 -->
<P>
Like the file objects they are associated with, extended attributes (EAs)
can have more than one process accessing them at the same time. This means
that one process could be querying EAs for a file object, while another
is setting EAs for the same file object.
<P>
In addition, operations on EAs are not atomic. That is, a query or set operation
might not complete before another query or set operation is performed on
the same object. If an error occurs before an entire list of EAs has been
set, all, some, or none of them may actually remain set on the file object.
This means that EAs may not remain in a consistent state unless the order
in which the operations are performed can be guaranteed.
<P>
Sharing protection is provided so that unpredictable results do not occur
during multiple simultaneous operations on extended attributes. EA manipulation
is associated with the access permission to the related file object (file
or directory).
<P>
<I>Handle-based access permission</I> is controlled by the sharing/access
mode of the associated file object:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the file object is open for read access, querying
EAs (using<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C3 FC --> DosQueryFileInfo</A>) is
permitted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the file object is open for write access, setting
EAs (using<A><!-- external link: 1D E9 C3 FC --> DosSetFileInfo</A>) is
permitted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<I>Path-based access permission</I> is controlled by adding the file object
to the sharing set for the duration of the call: an application requires
read access and file-sharing permission must be set to deny-write.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For setting EAs (using<A><!-- external link: 1D F2 C3 FC --> DosSetPathInfo</A>),
an application requires write access and file-sharing permission must be
deny-read-write.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The functions that set and query EAs fail if another process
holds conflicting sharing rights to the file object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
No explicit EA sharing is performed for<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 FC --> DosEnumAttribute</A>.
Implicit sharing exists if the caller passes the handle of an open file,
since sharing access to the associated file is required to modify its EA.
No sharing is performed if the caller passes the path name. This means that
if some other process is editing the EAs, and changes them between two calls
to<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 FC --> DosEnumAttribute</A>, inconsistent
results might be returned (for example, the same values might be returned
twice, some values might be missed, and so on).
<P>
To prevent the modification of EAs for the handle case, the file should
be opened in deny-write mode before calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 FC --> DosEnumAttribute</A>.
To prevent the modification of EAs for the path name case, the file should
be open in deny-write mode before calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 FC --> DosEnumAttribute</A>.
For the directory name case, no sharing is possible.
