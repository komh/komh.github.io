<P>
An installable file system is a file system in which software is installed
when the operating system is started. The OS/2 operating system supports
installable file systems and permits users to have multiple file systems
active at the same time.
<P>
Users install a file system by specifying the file system components in
the CONFIG.SYS file. The file system software consists of device drivers
and dynamic link libraries. The device drivers access storage devices; the
dynamic link libraries control the format of information on a device and
manage the flow of data to and from the device. The user must use the DEVICE=
command to specify the device driver and the IFS= command to specify the
dynamic link library.
<P>
Installable file system drivers are loaded during system initialization
when an IFS= statement is encountered in the CONFIG.SYS file. The operating
system loads the device driver and dynamic link library and initializes
a specific device for use with a file system.
<P>
These file systems can support file and directory structures different from
the FAT file system.
<P>
An example of an installable file system might be a file system designed
specifically for use on a network server. Another example of an installable
file system is the High Performance File System (HPFS), which is included
with the OS/2 operating system.
