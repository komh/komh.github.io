<P>
In order to take advantage of the capabilities of OS/2 file systems, application
developers must be able to manage the file systems.
<P>
Most of the file system functions work with either the FAT file system or
the High Performance File System (HPFS).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
