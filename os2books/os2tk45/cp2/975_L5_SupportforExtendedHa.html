<H1>Support for Extended Hardware Buffering</H1><!-- entering slot 1003 -->
<P>
Another significant feature of this device driver is its exploitation of
the Extended Hardware Buffering capabilities of the serial communications
devices in many IBM systems and option adapters. Extended Hardware Buffering
refers to the ability of the serial device servicing a COM port to buffer
in hardware several characters, and to release them all at one time on the
occurrence of a single transmit or receive hardware interrupt. This capability
significantly reduces the interrupt-driven I/O processing overhead required
to service Transmit and Receive requests on a given COM port. On the devices
that support the Extended Hardware Buffering capability, this significantly
improves COM I/O throughput and improves data integrity for higher data-transfer
rates.
<P>
The Extended Hardware Buffering capabilities are automatically controlled
under the default modes of the physical ASYNC device driver. Automatic Protocol
Override is a feature of the OS/2 ASYNC device driver that automatically
controls parameters relating to Extended Hardware Buffering. Systems and
Adapters that incorporate the<I> FIFO-mode</I> hardware feature in a manner
fully compatible with the NS-16550A UART are automatically enabled to run
in Automatic Protocol Override mode.
