<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 12 -->DosDevIOCtl</A> has many subfunctions.
These are called generic IOCtl commands and typically are used to retrieve
data from a device driver that is not available through standard OS/2 functions.
For example, an application can use these functions to set the bit rate
of a serial port or read input directly from a sector on a disk.
