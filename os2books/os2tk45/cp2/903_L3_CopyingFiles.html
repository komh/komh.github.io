<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 6C C3 1C -->DosCopy</A> is used to copy files
and subdirectories. Metacharacters (global file name characters) are not
allowed, so only individual files or entire subdirectories can be copied
with this function. The source and target can be on different drives.
<P>
When the source specified is a subdirectory and an I/O error occurs, the
file being copied from the source directory to the target directory at the
time of the error will be deleted from the target directory and DosCopy
will be terminated.

When a file is being copied and an I/O error occurs,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->if the source file name is that of a file to be appended,
the target file is resized to its original size.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 6C C3 1C -->DosCopy</A> will copy the attributes
of the source file, such as date of creation, and time of creation to the
target file. Additionally, DosCopy will copy the extended attributes of
the source file when creating a new subdirectory or a new file, or when
replacing an existing file.
