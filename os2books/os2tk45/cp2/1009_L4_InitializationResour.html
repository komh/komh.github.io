<P>
The device driver is loaded and initialized with a DEVICE= statement in
the CONFIG.SYS file. They physical device driver processes parameters on
the CONFIG.SYS to support COM ports with nonstandard address and IRQ's.
Type<B> help com.sys</B> and read about the parameters.
<P>
During initialization, the physical device driver attempts to free memory
from its data segment for ports it does not need and that do not get initialized.
The physical device driver does not remove device names from its device
driver header for ports that do not get initialized.
<P>
The device driver does not deinstall a device if the system requests it.
If another device driver wishes to support a port already supported by this
device driver, it needs to be initialized<I> before</I> this ASYNC device
driver.
<P>
Shared ownership of a given serial device between multiple device drivers
in a single session of the OS/2 operating system is supported, subject to
certain restrictions. Each driver that installs sharing a serial device
obtains exclusive access to that device when it processes an Open request,
rather than claiming the device during initialization. Each driver also
fully relinquishes control of that device, when it processes a matching
Close request.
<P>
When the physical device driver is initialized, it is enabled by default
for Output Handshaking Using CTS and DSR. This is for compatibility with
existing systems (IBM PC and PS/2 BIOS INT 14H) and the requirements of
supporting an RS232 port. It is also enabled by default for Input Sensitivity
to DSR. This allows a remote device to indicate whether data being received
is valid and is enabled to help ensure compatibility with existing systems.
The initialization default for Extended Hardware Buffering on serial devices
that fully support FIFO mode operations is Automatic Protocol Override.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The ASYNC device driver default protocols provide an upwardly
compatible RS232-C interface for communication with most devices. New communication
applications and devices might not require the default protocols to be enabled.
The user should evaluate these alternatives and consider which protocols
to enable or disable in order to provide the highest possible performance
for support of a given serial device.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
