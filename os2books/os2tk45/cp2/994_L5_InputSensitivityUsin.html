<P>
When the physical device driver is enabled for this mode of operation and
DSR is OFF, the physical device driver discards receive data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> When Input Sensitivity Using DSR is enabled,
the physical device driver responds to the lowering of the DSR line within
a single character time. That is, the Extended Hardware Buffering (Receive
Trigger Level) is adjusted so the device generates an interrupt for each
character received. The full 16-character receive buffer is still available
to help avoid any receive hardware overruns. The Transmit FIFO feature is
also still enabled so that only one transmit interrupt occurs for every
16 characters transmitted.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In situations where DSR can naturally drop from O to OFF at
the end of a communications session, but is not normally toggled during
the session, it is most advantageous to disable Input Sensitivity Using
DSR after the communications data transfer has begun. This achieves a significant
performance benefit (under the control of Automatic Protocol Override),
without the risk of losing valid data upon termination of the session. If,
however, the DSR signal is expected to toggle frequently during a communications
session, Input Sensitivity Using DSR should not be disabled, or<I> potential
data loss can result</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 26 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
