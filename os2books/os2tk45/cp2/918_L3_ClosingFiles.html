<H1>Closing Files</H1><!-- entering slot 941 -->
<P>
You can close a file by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> DosClose</A>.
Since each application has a limited number of file handles that can be
open at one time, it is a good practice to close a file after using it.

<P>
To do so, supply the file handle in<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> DosClose</A>,
as shown in the following code fragment:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File system values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define BUF_SIZE 80

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction;
    BYTE    abBuffer[BUF_SIZE];
    ULONG   ulRead;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen("SAMPLE.TXT",
                   &amp;hf,
                   &amp;ulAction,
                   0,
                   FILE_NORMAL,
                   FILE_OPEN,
                   OPEN_ACCESS_READONLY |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE,
                   (PEAOP2) NULL);

    if (!ulrc) {
        DosRead(hf,
                abBuffer,
                sizeof(abBuffer),
                &amp;ulRead);

        DosClose(hf);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
If you open a file for writing,<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 43 --> DosClose
</A>directs the system to flush the file buffer-that is, to write any existing
data in OS/2's intermediate file buffer to the disk or device. The system
keeps these intermediate file buffers to make file input and output more
efficient. For example, it saves data from previous calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 48 --> DosWrite
</A>until a certain number of bytes are in the buffer then writes the contents
of the buffer to the disk.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 43 -->DosClose</A>  also closes the handle
to the file (or pipe, or device). If one or more additional handles to a
file have been created with<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C3 44 --> DosDupHandle
</A>, the internal buffers for the file are not written to disk, and its
directory entry is not updated, until<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 43 --> DosClose
</A>has been called for all the handles.
<P>
