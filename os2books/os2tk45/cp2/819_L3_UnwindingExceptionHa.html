<H1>Unwinding Exception Handlers</H1><!-- entering slot 837 -->
<P>
In addition to handling exceptions, exception handlers are used to clean
up resources during the execution of a nonlocal GOTO instruction or during
thread termination. (A nonlocal GOTO instruction jumps to a label outside
the current procedure. The label is a procedure address or an address within
a procedure that is on the stack, higher in the call frame chain.)
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 -->DosUnwindException</A> calls and removes
exception handlers from a thread's chain of registered exception handlers
up to, but not including, a specified exception handler. This is known as
an<I> unwind operation</I>.<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>can also be used to unwind all exception handlers from the thread's
exception handler chain and to terminate the thread.
<P>
For example, with the C language setjmp() and longjmp() routines, the setjmp()
would save the address of the current exception handler structure, along
with any other information that is necessary to perform the longjmp() routine.
 (The address of the current exception handler structure is obtained from
the head of the exception handler chain. A pointer to the head of the chain
is located in the Thread Information Block.)
<P>
The longjmp() routine would initiate the unwind of procedure call frames
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException</A> and
passing to it the saved address of the <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>data structure. If the address of the <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>data structure is not found in the chain, then the XCPT_INVALID_UNWIND_TARGET
exception is raised, and the chain is not unwound.
<P>
The machine state at the time of the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>is captured in ContextRecord. The EH_UNWINDING flag is set in the exception
flags field of the <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>data structure. The EH_EXIT_UNWIND flag is also set if the <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>parameter is set to 0 (if the application does not provide its own <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>parameter OS/2 will construct one). A backward walk through the procedure
call frames is then performed to find the target of the unwind operation.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Even though a ContextRecord is used to capture the state of
the machine, unwinding is not considered an exception.  It is simply delivered
through the exception mechanism.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
The first parameter to<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>is the address of an exception handler's <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 -->DosUnwindException</A> will unwind
exception handlers up to, but not including that exception handler. If a
-1 is passed to<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>for this parameter,<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>will unwind all the exception handlers on the chain. If a 0 is passed
to<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException</A> for this
parameter,<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException</A> will
unwind all the exception handlers on the chain and exit.
<P>
There is no return from a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 FC --> DosUnwindException</A>,
unless the stack is invalid. Control is transferred to the specified instruction
pointer address. If<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>encounters an error during its processing, it raises another exception
rather than return control to the caller.
<P>
If the target call frame is reached and an exit unwind is not being performed
(that is, an <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>is not 0), then the computed machine state is restored from ContextRecord
and control is transferred to the address specified by the target-IP address
parameter. Note that the stack pointer is not restored, making it possible
to transfer information on the stack. It is the responsibility of the code
at the target address to reset the stack pointer as necessary.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 -->DosUnwindException</A> is called with
C language calling conventions, which permits the use of a variable number
of arguments. Thus, the caller can pass any amount of information on the
stack, to be picked up at the target-IP address.
<P>
If an exit unwind is being performed (the <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>parameter is 0), then all call frames are unwound until the base of
the stack is reached.
<P>
If the <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>parameter is specified, then each exception handler encountered during
the unwind operation is called, using the specified record. If this parameter
is not specified, then<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 47 --> DosUnwindException
</A>constructs an <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>that specifies the exception XCPT_UNWIND.
<P>
<B>Colliding Unwinds</B>
<BR>
During an unwind operation, it is possible for one unwind to collide with
a previous unwind. This occurs when the scope of the second unwind overlaps
the scope of the first unwind. Following are two situations:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The target frame of the second unwind is a frame that
has already been unwound by the first unwind.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The target frame of the second unwind is a valid frame
that is positioned before or after the target frame of the first unwind.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Either of these situations could occur during the following scenarios:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An unwind handler calls unwind, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An unwind handler hits an exception that has called
unwind.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In the first scenario, the second unwind is attempting to unwind to an invalid
target. This causes the exception XCPT_INVALID_UNWIND_TARGET to be raised.

<P>
In the second scenario, the first unwind is abandoned, and the second unwind
<!-- entering slot 838 -->continues to its target. The second scenario is
far more likely.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A user program that uses high level language exception mechanisms
must never call<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 FC --> DosUnwindException</A>,
because this could create conflicts with the runtime exception strategy
of the high level language. Unwind operations in this case are performed
through language-supported facilities such as the C language longjmp() routine.
