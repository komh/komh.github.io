<P>
Enhanced Flags1.  Bit 1 represents the status of the Enhanced mode. As a
default, the Enhanced mode is enabled and this bit is set to 1.  Bits 2-5
represent the DMA operation options set by the user that have been executed
successfully or the system default, if no user options have been requested
so far.  The setting of bit 1 is meaningful only when bit 0 is set, and
the settings of bits 2-5 are meaningful only when bit 1 is set.
<P>
Bit 6 shows the most recent Receive Operation mode.  If it is set, the receive
operation is in DMA mode.  When the system is initialized and no receive
operation has been done, the state of this bit is meaningless. Bit 7 shows
the most recent Transmit Operation mode.  If it is set, the transmit operation
is in DMA mode.  When the system is initialized and no transmit operation
has been done, the state of this bit is meaningless.
