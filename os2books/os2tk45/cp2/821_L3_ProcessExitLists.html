A process executes any routines registered in its exit list (with<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 FC --> DosExitList</A>)
after the Process Termination exception has been delivered to each thread
in the process and after each thread except Thread 1 has finally been terminated.
If a thread handles the process termination exception, it must eventually
voluntarily terminate, or the exit-list sequence will not finish running
properly. Threads must not use<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 FC --> DosCreateThread</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC -->DosExecPgm</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>,
or<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 10 --> DosExit</A> when they are delivered
a process termination exception.
