<H1>Managing Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 907 -->
<P>
An application can create, query, and set extended attributes (EAs) for
any file object.
<P>
The application can define extended attributes for a file when the file
is created with DosOpen. Similarly, the application can define EAs for a
directory when the directory is created using DosCreateDir.
<P>
An application can define EAs for existing file objects by referencing the
file object by its handle and calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E9 C3 FC --> DosSetFileInfo</A>,
or by referencing the file object by its name and calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F2 C3 FC --> DosSetPathInfo</A>.

<P>
An application can examine the EAs for a file object by referencing the
file object by its handle and calling<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C3 FC --> DosQueryFileInfo</A>,
or by referencing the file object by its name and calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C3 FC --> DosQueryPathInfo</A>.
The application can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C3 FC --> DosEnumAttribute</A>,
using either the file object's handle or its name, to get information about
the file object's EAs.
<P>
In addition, an application can search for file objects and specify that
certain EAs be returned by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 FC --> DosFindFirst</A>.
