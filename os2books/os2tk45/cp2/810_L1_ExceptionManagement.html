<H1>Exception Management</H1><!-- entering slot 827 -->
<P>
An<I> exception</I> is an abnormal condition that can occur during program
execution. Common causes of exceptions include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->I/O errors<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Protection violations<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Math errors<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Intervention by the user or by another process<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Activities that can cause exceptions include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Trying to use memory that you do not have permission
to access<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Dividing by 0<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The user pressing Ctrl+Break<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Exceptions include both unexpected errors (such as a memory protection
violation) and expected errors (such as guard-page exceptions). Exceptions
can be a<I> synchronous exception</I>, that is, caused by an action of the
executing thread, or an<I> asynchronous exception</I>, caused by an event
external to the executing thread (such as the user pressing Ctrl+Break).
When an exception is caused by the user pressing Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C, or
by another process issuing DosKillProcess for your process, the exception
is called a<I> signal exception</I>.
<P>
In most cases, the default action taken by OS/2  when an exception occurs
is to terminate the application that caused the exception. Rather than having
OS/2 default action occur, an application can register its own subroutine
to handle exceptions. These routines are called<I> exception handlers</I>.
Exception handlers enable an application to handle some errors itself, allowing
the application to avoid termination (or at least to terminate gracefully).

<P>
When exception handlers are registered, they are added to an<I> exception
handler chain</I>. The chain starts empty and each new handler is added
to the head of the chain. Exceptions are passed to the exception handlers
in the chain in Last-In-First-Out order, so the last exception handler to
be registered is the first one to get an opportunity to handle each exception.

<P>
Exception handlers have the capability to complete critical code sections
without being interrupted by other asynchronous exceptions; these critical
code sections are called<I> must-complete</I> sections.
<P>
Exception handlers can be removed from the exception handler chains with
<A><!-- external link: 1D 08 C4 FC -->DosUnsetExceptionHandler</A>. Another
way that exception handlers can be removed from the chain is with an<I> unwind
</I>operation. When unwinding an exception handler, the exception handler
is first called, then removed from the exception handler chain.
