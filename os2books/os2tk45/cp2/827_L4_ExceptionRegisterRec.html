<H1>ExceptionRegisterRecord Data Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 846 -->
<P>
The application is responsible for the creation and registration of the
<A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD</A> data
structure. This is the data structure used by the application when it established
the exception handler on the chain.
<P>
The only restrictions are that each pointer in the linked list must either
point directly to the next pointer in the list or contain END_OF_CHAIN (-1),
and the field immediately following the pointer field must be the pointer
to the exception handler code. No fields other than these two will be examined
by OS/2. The application can keep any state information that it chooses
in this data structure, as long as it does not alter either of the fields
used by the system.
<P>
When a procedure begins, it must create an <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>on the stack, fill in the pointer to the exception handler routine,
and link the data structure to the front of the exception handler chain
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C3 FC --> DosSetExceptionHandler</A>.

<P>
Similarly, when the procedure ends, it must remove <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>from the chain by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 08 C4 FC --> DosUnsetExceptionHandler</A>.
This maintains the necessary frame-exception handler correspondence.

<P>
For the benefit of assembly language programmers, the Thread Information
Block (<A HREF="566_L2_TIB.html">TIB</A>) is located at FS:[0]. This speeds
access to the <A HREF="566_L2_TIB.html">TIB</A> data structure.
<P>
Because the FS is used to point to the <A HREF="566_L2_TIB.html">TIB</A>,
applications that use the FS register must restore the original value when
they are finished. Exception handling depends on the FS register pointing
to the <A HREF="566_L2_TIB.html">TIB</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD</A> data
structure must be created on the stack of the application. That is, it must
be a data structure that is local to the routine that registers the exception
handler. It cannot be stored in the application's data segment. The reason
for this is that OS/2 must be able to determine the relative ordering of
ExceptionRegistration records by examining their addresses.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
