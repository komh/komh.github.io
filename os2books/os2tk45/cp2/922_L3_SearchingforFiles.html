<H1>Searching for Files</H1><!-- entering slot 945 -->
<P>
You can locate files with names that match a given pattern by using metacharacters
in<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 4D --> DosFindFirst</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 4E --> DosFindNext
</A>.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 4D -->DosFindFirst</A> searches the current
directory  and locates the first file name that matches the given pattern.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 4E -->DosFindNext</A> locates the next matching
file  name and continues to find additional matches on each subsequent call
until all matching names are found. The functions copy the file statistics
on each file located to a data structure that you supply. The file information
returned by a search includes file dates and times, length of data in the
file, file size, file attributes, and file name.
<P>
To find all files that match the file specification, call DosFindNext repeatedly
until the message ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES is returned. Then call<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C3 4C --> DosFindClose
</A>to close the directory handle.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to find all file names that have the
extension ".C":
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File system values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HDIR         hdHdir;
    ULONG        ulFilenames;
    FILEFINDBUF3 ffbFindBuf;
    APIRET       ulrc;

    ulFilenames = 1;
    hdHdir = HDIR_SYSTEM;

    ulrc = DosFindFirst("*.C",
                        &amp;hdHdir,            /* Directory handle                     */
                        FILE_NORMAL,        /* File attribute to look for           */
                        &amp;ffbFindBuf,        /* Result buffer                        */
                        sizeof(ffbFindBuf), /* Size of result buffer                */
                        &amp;ulFilenames,       /* Number of matching names to look for */
                        FIL_STANDARD);      /* Standard level of information        */

    if (!ulrc) {
        do {
            .
            .     /* Use file name in findbuf.achName */
            .
            ulrc = DosFindNext(hdHdir,
                               &amp;ffbFindBuf,
                               sizeof(ffbFindBuf),
                               &amp;ulFilenames);

        } while (!ulrc);
    }
    DosFindClose(hdHdir);

<P>
In this example,<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 4E --> DosFindNext</A> continues
to retrieve matching file names until it returns an error value (it returns
ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES when it cannot find any more matching files).
<P>
To keep track of which files have already been found, both functions use
the directory handle,<I> hdir</I>.
<P>
This directory handle must be set to HDIR_SYSTEM or HDIR_CREATE before the
call to DosFindFirst. HDIR_SYSTEM (00000001H) tells OS/2 to use the system
handle for standard output, which is always available to the requesting
process. HDIR_CREATE (FFFFFFFFH) tells OS/2 to allocate a new, unused handle.

<P>
The directory handle returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 4D --> DosFindFirst
</A>must be used in subsequent calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 4E --> DosFindNext
</A>; it identifies for DosFindNext the name of the file being sought and
the current position in the directory.
<P>
An attribute parameter for DosFindFirst allows hidden and system files,
as well as normal files, to be included in searches.
<P>
After locating the files you need, use DosFindClose to close the directory
handle. This ensures that when you search for the same files again, you
will start at the beginning of the directory. After DosFindClose is called,
a subsequent DosFindNext fails.
