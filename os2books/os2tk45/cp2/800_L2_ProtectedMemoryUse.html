<P>
OS/2 provides shared library support in the form of 32-bit DLLs.  All 32-bit
dynamic links or APIs are called using near CALL or RET instructions, so
the cost of making dynamic-link calls should be significantly less than
the cost of making the comparable calls in the 16-bit version of OS/2, where
a far CALL is required.  The DLLs execute in the context of the caller.

<P>
All 32-bit DLLs are mapped into the appropriate shared memory region of
the requesting processes at load time and execute at ring 3 without IOPL.
 This model's protection characteristics correspond closest to the ring
3 dynamic-linking model in the 16-bit version of OS/2. The following figure
shows how 32-bit DLLs are implemented in the linear memory model of OS/2.

<P>
A 32-Bit DLL
<P>

<P>
However, since 32-bit EXE programs can address the entire address space
with a 32-bit offset, it is easier for a 32-bit application programmer to
potentially cast a bad pointer to data in the shared region than in the
16-bit segmented addressing scheme.  Since many subsystems have semaphores
and other shared data structures in the shared region, the potential for
an inadvertently errant application to affect another process sharing a
subsystem becomes an issue in the flat environment.  Therefore, OS/2 provides
a mechanism for DLLs to protect their critical shared global data regions
from 32-bit EXEs.  This mechanism prevents a thread in one process from
potentially affecting other processes using the same resources (subsystems),
or potentially taking down the entire workstation if the compromised subsystem
is critical (such as PM).
<P>

<P>
OS/2 enables existing 16-bit DLLs and new 32-bit DLLs to get their shared
global data allocated into a single protected region that is not accessible
by 32-bit EXEs, thereby achieving a level of protection.  There is no provision
for protecting DLLs from each other or from threads executing 16-bit EXE
modules.  The MEMMAN CONFIG.SYS line supports a "PROTECT/NOPROTECT" option,
as follows, for enabling or disabling memory protection:
<PRE>MEMMAN=SWAP,PROTECT
</PRE>

<P>
If neither PROTECT nor NOPROTECT is specified, the default is protection
enabled (PROTECT).
<P>
When protection is enabled, the memory manager reserves a 64M region of
the linear address space below the 512MB line; this is called the<I> protected
region</I>.  Protected objects are allocated within the protected region.
 The following types of memory are considered protected:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DLL Global Data<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Global data that is part of the
DLL image when loaded.  This is only global shared data, not<!-- entering slot 817 --> instance
data.  Although DLL code is shared, it is not allocated in the protected
region since it is read-only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DLL Run-Time Shared
Data<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Global data that is allocated at runtime by
a thread executing in DLL code that is a protected API.  This includes 16-
and 32-bit, named and unnamed, shared memory, and shared memory allocated
with DosAllocSeg with the share flag set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The DS value that is used for the user address space (FlatDS) no longer
references a descriptor with a 512MB limit.  Instead the system exports
another DS value for the user address space called the ProtDS that does
have the 512MB limit-the FlatDS limit is reduced by the size of the protected
region.  When a 32-bit EXE is executing, it runs with the FlatDS and is
unable to access protected objects created by 16-bit, 32-bit, or 16- and
32-bit DLLs.  If the thread calls a 16-bit DLL API entry point, the DLL
will have addressability to the protected region through the LDT.  If the
thread calls a 32-bit DLL entry point that is protected, the 32-bit DLL
entry point contains code to switch to the ProtDS so that the protected
region is accessible-the 32-bit DLL switches back to the FlatDS before completing
service. A switch on the C compiler is used to generate the code sequence
as shown in the following figure.
<PRE>DLLAPI  proc    push    ds
    push    es
    mov     dx, seg FLAT:DGROUP
    mov     ds, dx
    mov     es, dx

    .....

    pop     es
    pop     ds
    ret
DLLAPI  endp
</PRE>

<P>
Although SS is not loaded with the ProtDS, a subsystem that switches stacks
to a protected stack must write some assembler code to change ESP-thus the
subsystem also should set up SS to be the ProtDS when performing the stack
switch.
<P>
When protection is not enabled, FlatDS=ProtDS and the code still works the
same.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The system currently is not sensitive to whether parameters
are being validated relative to the FlatDS or the ProtDS when ring 0 kernel
APIs are called.  Also the 3216 thunks do not probe 32-bit parameters before
converting them and passing them to a 16-bit DLL.
<P>
The grouping of protected allocations can be enabled or disabled on a per
DLL basis.  For 32-bit DLLs, the Linker uses the PROTECT parameter in the
DEF file to provide protection information in the DLL's module flags to
the loader.  All 16-bit modules requiring protection must be specified with
the new PROTECT16 CONFIG.SYS parameter.
<PRE>PROTECT16=DLLNAME1,DLLNAME2,...,DLLNAMEX
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that the DLL suffix is not required.  Only DLL files can get the
protection.
