<P>
Each directory entry includes a set of file attributes. File attributes
specify whether the directory entry is for a file, a directory, or a volume
identifier. The attributes also specify if the file is read-only, hidden,
archived, or a system file.
<P>
A<I> read-only</I> file cannot be opened for writing, nor can it be deleted.
A<I> hidden</I> file (or directory) cannot be displayed by using an ordinary
directory listing. A<I> system</I> file is excluded from normal directory
searches. The<I> archived attribute</I> is for use by special purpose applications
to mark a file that has been changed since the last time the file was examined.

<P>
An application can retrieve and set the file attributes by using<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C3 19 --> DosQueryFileInfo
</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D E9 C3 FC --> DosSetFileInfo</A>.
