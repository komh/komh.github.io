<H1>Creating a Simple DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 808 -->
<P>
DLLs typically are used to provide common functions that can be used by
a number of applications. The following figure shows a C source file, MYPUTS.C,
for a DLL that contains a simple string-printing function.
<PRE>#include &lt;os2.h&gt;

#define HF_STDOUT 1  /* standard-output handle               */

VOID EXPENTRY myPuts(PSZ pszMsg)
{
    ULONG ulWritten;

    while(*pszMsg) {
        DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
                 pszMsg,
                 1,
                 &amp;ulWritten);

        pszMsg++;
    }

}
</PRE>

<P>
The following figure shows the module-definition file, MYPUTS.DEF, for this
DLL.
<PRE>    LIBRARY myputs
    DATA SINGLE SHARED
    EXPORTS
        myPuts
</PRE>

<P>
The LIBRARY statement names the DLL (MYPUTS.DLL).  The DATA statement tells
the system that this DLL will share all data with each process that uses
the DLL.  The EXPORTS statement indicates that the function myPuts can be
used by applications and DLLs.
<P>
The DLL is compiled and linked like any application. You can use IBM's ICC
and LINK386, as shown below, to create MYPUTS.DLL.
<PRE>    icc  /C+ /Ge- myputs.c

    link386 /noi myputs, , nul, OS2386, myputs
</PRE>

<P>
When the DLL has been created, you must copy it to one of the directories
indicated by the LIBPATH environment variable in your CONFIG.SYS file.
