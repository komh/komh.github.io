<H1>Preserving Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 910 -->
<P>
Extended attributes (EAs) are supported in OS/2's FAT file system and High
Performance File System (HPFS). Extended attributes are not supported by
the FAT file system used in versions of OS/2 prior to Version 1.2, nor are
they supported in the DOS operating system.
<P>
EAs associated with a file object are not part of a file object or of its
data, but are maintained separately and managed by the file system that
manages that object. EAs reside on the volume on which the file object resides
and are connected to their file object by pointers from the file object.

<P>
Therefore, EAs belonging to a file object are lost when moving that file
object from a storage device managed by an OS/2 FAT or installable file
system to a storage device managed by the old FAT file system.
<P>
EAs can be lost under other circumstances, as well:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When a program that does not recognize EAs (for example,
an editor written for DOS) performs a non-truncating open on the files with
which the EAs are associated<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the files they are associated with are sent over
COM links<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
So that files with EAs can be manipulated under these circumstances, without
losing their EAs, OS/2 provides a utility called EAUTIL EAUTIL enables users
to separate extended attributes from the specified file object, optionally
disassociating them from the file object. The extended attributes are placed
into a specified HoldFile. This utility also enables users to reattach the
separated extended attributes with their file objects.
<P>
EAUTIL can be applied to subdirectories, as well as to files. It does not
support global file name characters in parameters; it operates on a single
file object at each invocation.
<P>
Users can use EAUTIL to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Strip EAs off files to be edited with a program that
does not recognize EAs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Place the EAs into normal files so they can be dealt
with by old tools (such as backup, restore, and so on) or easily transmitted.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Reattach EAs to files after the files have been brought
back from the systems where EAs are not supported.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
