<P>
Files are accessed through the file system using file handles. File handles
are returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 25 --> DosOpen</A> when the
file is opened and are used for all subsequent accesses to the file. Files
can be be created, opened, read from, written to, closed, copied, moved,
deleted, renamed, and locked. Files can be searched for based on a metacharacter
pattern template.
<P>
Each open file has a file pointer that indicates the current reading or
writing location within the file. The file pointer moves automatically with
each read or write operation on the file and can be moved manually by the
application.
<P>
The standard file handles-standard input, standard output, and standard
error-provide redirectable input and output to applications. The standard
file handles can be used to read input from the keyboard and write output
to the display. Alternatively, they can be redirected to read input from
and write output to a file. To an application reading and writing the standard
file handles, there is no difference between the two.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an <A HREF="001_L2_APIRET.html">APIRET
</A>value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is
returned, an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
