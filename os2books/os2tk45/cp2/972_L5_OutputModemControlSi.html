<H1>Output Modem Control Signals</H1><!-- entering slot 1000 -->
<P>
In addition to allowing the application to directly control RTS and DTR,
the physical device driver has different automatic control modes to control
the value of the output modem control signals:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open and Close processing of DTR and RTS<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Disable/Enable DTR and RTS<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->RTS toggling on transmit<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Input handshaking using DTR and RTS<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These control modes are described in the section on <A HREF="981_L4_StatesoftheASYNCDevi.html">States
of the ASYNC Device Driver</A>, and in the IOCtls description.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The level of support provided by this device driver requires
that DTR and RTS are turned on at least once, even if this puts the physical
device driver in a mode where they will never be turned on again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
