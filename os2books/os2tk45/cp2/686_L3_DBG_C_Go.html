<P>
Pid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<B>Returns</B>
<P>
All non-frozen threads of the debuggee are allowed to execute user code
at once. If all of the debuggee threads are frozen, an error is returned.

<P>
The DBG_C_Go command completes when a<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 20 --> DosDebug
</A>event (such as a Breakpoint) occurs. This event can be any one of the
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 20 -->DosDebug</A> notifications. See <A HREF="710_L2_DosDebugNotification.html">DosDebug
Notifications</A> for more information.
<P>
When the next<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 20 --> DosDebug</A> event occurs,
all threads in the debuggee process are marked to not execute any additional
user code until the next DBG_C_Go command is issued. This provides a stable
environment for debugging.
<P>
When the DBG_C_Go command returns, the register set is automatically updated
to reflect the thread that detected the event.
