<P>
The physical ASYNC device driver does not prevent multiple processes from
concurrently opening the same device name. The physical device driver uses
standard file system contention control. An application or subsystem that
needs exclusive access to the COM device will open it with access rights
set to DENY_ANY. Inheritance of open handles, and sharing of the device
among multiple opens, works in a manner similar to regular files.
