<P>
OS/2 communicates with devices through special programs called<I> device
drivers</I>. A device driver acts as an interface between OS/2, together
with its applications, and a physical device such as the keyboard, mouse,
or printer. The device driver sends data to and receives data from a device,
resolving device-independent requests from applications with the device-specific
attributes of the device.
<P>
The primary method of communication between OS/2 and a device driver is
request packets. OS/2 receives I/O requests from applications and sends
data in the form of request packets to the device driver. The device driver
communicates with the device either directly or through the BIOS and ABIOS
interfaces. (Applications can communicate with device drivers also, by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC -->DosDevIOCtl</A>. See <A HREF="775_L3_IOCtlInterface.html">IOCtl
Interface</A>)
<P>
Devices work differently depending on the device driver installed. For example,
if an application writes to the system console, each byte is interpreted
as a character and is displayed on the screen. If, however, the ANSI display
driver is loaded, some byte sequences direct the system to carry out certain
actions on the screen, such as moving the cursor or clearing the screen.
These byte sequences are called ANSI<I> escape sequences</I>.
<P>
Some devices are available to applications only if the appropriate device
driver is installed. For example, an application cannot open a serial port
unless a communications device driver, such as COM.SYS, has been loaded
by using a DEVICE= command in CONFIG.SYS.
