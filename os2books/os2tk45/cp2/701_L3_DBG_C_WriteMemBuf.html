<B>Debug Command 23 - Write Memory Buffer Command</B>
<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Process ID of debuggee<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Cmd<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= DBG_C_WriteMemBuf<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Addr<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Debuggee address to write to<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Buffer<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Debugger address to copy from<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Len<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Number of bytes to write<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Returns</B>
<P>
The number of bytes specified by Len is copied from the debugger's Buffer
into the debuggee's memory space starting at Addr.
<P>
This command is not serialized with respect to the <A HREF="686_L3_DBG_C_Go.html">DBG_C_Go
</A>command.
<P>
In the case of a write to shared read-only memory, the memory is first converted
to private, and any set dynamic RAS logging points are removed from that
memory, before the write is performed.
<P>
Dynamic RAS logging will continue to function in that area, in the context
of other processes. The area will continue to be shared by other processes,
if any.
<P>
In this way, breakpoints may be set in the debuggee without affecting the
other modules.
<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
You are unable to write to any memory outside user space.
<P>
Both specified memory regions must be currently valid.
