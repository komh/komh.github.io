<H1>Writing Cache Buffers</H1><!-- entering slot 982 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 56 -->DosResetBuffer</A> is used to write
to disk (flush) the file system's cache buffers for a specific file handle.
When called with a value of hex FFFF for the file handle,<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 56 --> DosResetBuffer
</A>writes all files belonging to the requesting process to disk (this usage
should be administered with care, so the user is not burdened with insertion
and removal of a large number of removable media volumes).
<P>
When<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 56 --> DosResetBuffer</A> is called
for single file handle, the directory entry for the file is updated as if
the file had been closed. However, the file remains open.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 56 -->DosResetBuffer</A> can also be called
with the name of a named pipe. The process that calls<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 56 --> DosResetBuffer
</A>is blocked at one end of the pipe until all data it has written has
been successfully read by the process at the other end of the pipe. This
enables communicating processes to synchronize their dialogs.
<P>
The following code fragment opens a file, writes some data to the file's
buffer, then writes the file's system buffer to the disk.
