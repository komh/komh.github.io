<P>
OS/2 enables you to access peripheral devices using file system commands,
and treat those devices as file streams of data. These devices include:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Character devices<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL> COM, clock, console (keyboard
and screen), screen, keyboard, printer, null, pointer, and mouse devices.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Standard I/O devices<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL> Character
devices automatically installed by OS/2 and recognized by the file system
as the standard input, standard output, and standard error devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Pseudocharacter
devices<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL> An application can attach a device name
to a file system and use the file system as a pseudocharacter device (also
called a single-file device). Attaching a device name to a file system allows
an application to open the device associated with the file system as if
it were a character device (for example, a serial port) and read from and
write to the device by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 33 --> DosRead
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.
<P>
In addition, an application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D EB C3 35 --> DosSetFilePtr
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D EA C3 34 --> DosSetFileLocks</A> with a
pseudocharacter device. Also, pseudocharacter devices can be redirected.

<P>
A file system that can be attached to a pseudocharacter device is typically
associated with a single disk file or with a special storage device, such
as a tape drive. The file system establishes a connection with the device
and transfers requests and data between OS/2 and the device. The user perceives
this file as a device name for a nonexistent device.
<P>
This file is seen as a character device because the current drive and directory
have no effect on the name. A pseudocharacter device name is an ASCII string
with the name of an OS/2 file in the form:
<PRE>  \DEV\DEV_NAME
</PRE>

<P>
The "\dev\" is a required part of the name, but there is no actual subdirectory
named "\dev\". This just lets OS/2 know that it is a pseudocharacter device
name.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Logical file devices<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL> The
hard disk or floppy disk drives, or the partitions on the hard disk or floppy
disk drives.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
