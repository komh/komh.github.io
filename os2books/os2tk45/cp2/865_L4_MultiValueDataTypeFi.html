<H1>Multi-Value Data Type Fields</H1><!-- entering slot 885 -->
<P>
In many cases, it is desirable for extended attributes (EAs) to store more
than a single piece of information. For example, an extended attribute can
store a list of names to which a document was sent. The multi-value formats
specify how individual pieces of data are stored.
<P>
Data entries are length-preceded, making it easy to traverse a multi-valued
list.
<P>
In order to allow EAs of different code pages, multi-valued EAs include
a field in which the EA's code page is specified. For example, the code
page field could be used to indicate that the comments for a Kanji file
are written in Spanish. If this value is 0, the file default is assumed.
(Code page data is for use by applications. OS/2 does not examine or use
EA code page information.)
<P>
When the concept of a default applies to a multi-valued EA, the first entry
in the list is assumed to be the default. For example, suppose an EA entry
contains the strings "Text" and "C Code". "Text" is considered the default
type. If "C Code" were the first entry in the list ("C Code" then "Text"),
then "C Code" would be considered the default type.
<P>
There are three multi-valued EA data types:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multi-Valued, Multi-Typed Data<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Multi-Valued, Single-Type Data<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->ASN.1 Data<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
