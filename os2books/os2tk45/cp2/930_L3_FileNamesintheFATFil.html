<H1>File Names in the FAT File System</H1><!-- entering slot 953 -->
<P>
Valid file names in the OS/2 FAT file system have the following form:
<PRE>    [drive:][directory\]filename[extension]
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> drive</I> parameter must name an existing drive and can be any letter
from A through Z. The drive letter must be followed by a colon (:).
<P>
The<I> directory</I> parameter specifies the directory that contains the
file's directory entry. The directory name must be followed by a backslash
(\) to separate it from the file name. If the specified directory is not
the current directory,<I> directory</I> must include the names of all the
directories in the path, separated by backslashes. The root directory is
specified by using a backslash at the beginning of the name.
<P>
For example, if the directory ABC is in the directory SAMPLE, and SAMPLE
is in the root directory, the directory specification is:
<PRE>    \SAMPLE\ABC.
</PRE>

<P>
A directory name can also have an extension, which is any combination of
up to three letters, digits, or special characters, preceded by a period
(.).
<P>
The<I> filename</I> and<I> extension</I> parameters specify the file.
<P>
<B>FAT File-Naming Rules</B>
<BR>
For file objects managed by the FAT file system, the following rules apply:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->File names are limited to 8 characters before and
three characters after a single dot. This is referred to as the 8.3 file
name format.
<P>
The 8 characters before the dot are blank-filled. Embedded blanks are significant,
trailing blanks and blanks immediately preceding the dot are not significant.
Trailing blanks are truncated.
<P>
For example, "FILE.A" is really "FILE   .A  ". "FILE.A" and "FILE   .A  "
are treated as the same file by the operating system and refer to the same
file. Also, "FILE.TXT  " and "FILE.TXT" are treated as the same file.
<P>
Blanks elsewhere in the name are significant-"F I L E.TXT" is not the same
as "FILE.TXT".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Names are not case sensitive. This means that "FILE.TXT"
and "file.txt" refer to the same file. Lowercase and uppercase characters
are folded together for name comparison purposes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Names returned by file system functions are in uppercase.
This means that if "file.txt" is created, DosFindFirst returns "FILE.TXT".
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Directory and file names can be any combination of
up to eight letters, digits, or the following special characters:
<PRE>    <B>$   %   '   -   _   @   {   }   ~   `   !   # (   )</B>
</PRE>

<P>
File extensions can be any combination of up to three letters, digits, or
special characters, preceded by a period.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Invalid characters for directory names, file names,
and volume labels are:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the range 0 - 1Fh<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->and the characters:
<PRE>    &lt;   &gt;   |   +   =   :   ;   ,   .   "   /   \   [   ]
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
