<H1>Obtaining Information about an Attached File System</H1><!-- entering slot 977 -->
<P>
To obtain information about block devices, and all character and pseudocharacter
devices, including the type of device and the name of the file system driver
the device is attached to, use<A><!-- external link: 1D C3 C3 FC --> DosQueryFSAttach</A>.

<P>
The information can be used to determine if the operating system recognizes
that a particular file system is attached to a storage device. This is important
to an application that must guarantee such a state. An application of this
type must handle the situation where the file system driver that formatted
a certain disk was not loaded during system startup.  (The user might have
omitted the IFS= statement in the CONFIG.SYS. file). In such a situation,
the data on the disk could be destroyed because the wrong file system was
attached to the disk by default.
<P>
The following code fragment returns information about an attached file system.

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    UCHAR       ucDeviceName[8];  /* Device name or drive letter     */
                                /* string                          */
    ULONG       ulOrdinal;        /* Ordinal of entry in name list   */
    ULONG       ulFSAInfoLevel;   /* Type of attached FSD data       */
                                /* required                        */
    FSQBUFFER2  fsqDataBuffer;    /* Returned data buffer            */
    ULONG       ulDataBufferLen;  /* Buffer length                   */
    APIRET      ulrc;             /* Return code                     */

    strcpy(ucDeviceName,
           "Y:");  /* Logical drive of the attached file system */

    ulFSAInfoLevel = 1;

    ulDataBufferLen = sizeof(FSQBUFFER2);    /* Data buffer length   */

    ulrc = DosQueryFSAttach(ucDeviceName,
                            ulOrdinal,
                            ulFSAInfoLevel,
                            &amp;fsqDataBuffer,
                            &amp;ulDataBufferLen);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosQueryFSAttach error: return code = %ld", ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
In this example, information was requested about the drive whose name was
specified within the<I> DeviceName</I> variable. After the<A><!-- external link: 1D C3 C3 44 --> DosQueryFSAttach
</A>call, the<I> DataBuffer</I> structure contained a set of information
describing the specified attached file system, and the<I> DataBufferLen
</I>variable contained the size of information within the structure.
