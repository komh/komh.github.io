<P>
The only permitted debugging level number is shown in the following list:

</UL>
<P>
This must be the first<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> command.
No other<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> command will
be accepted until the debugging connection has been established.
<P>
<B>Returns</B>
<P>
This command establishes a debugging connection. It must be the initial
command, since it verifies the buffer format for the rest of the connection.

<P>
Because<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> usually cannot
be ported to new machines without changing the format of the buffer, this
command is needed to establish that the debugger is capable of handling
the desired buffer format.
<P>
If the requested debugging level is not supported, an error is returned,
and the connection is not made. This gives the debugger a chance to try
again, or to automatically start a different debugger process that uses
a different buffer format.
<P>
For this command, only the machine-independent portion of the buffer is
examined. This portion includes the Pid, Tid, Cmd, and Value fields. This
makes it possible to port the<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug
</A>buffer from one machine to another, without returning an error to the
debugger on the initial<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> command.

<P>
The only<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> notifications
that are returned by this command are <A HREF="711_L3_DBG_N_Success.html">DBG_N_Success
</A>and <A HREF="712_L3_DBG_N_Error.html">DBG_N_Error</A>.
<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
If the connection to the debuggee is not established within a reasonable
amount of time, it is assumed that the connection will never be established,
and the debuggee process is terminated automatically.
<P>
The current format level may or may not be supported in future versions.
This is due to the machine dependence of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug
</A>function.
<P>
<B>Remarks</B>
<P>
If<I> Addr</I> is set to 0, the connection between the debugger and the
program being debugged is not severed. If any debuggee threads, other than
the thread that encountered the debug event, are holding system semaphores,
they will be allowed to run until they release the semaphores. They will
then be stopped and the notification will be delivered.
<P>
If the thread encountering the debug event is holding a system semaphore
the debugger/debuggee connection is severed by terminating the debuggee,
and returning a <A HREF="712_L3_DBG_N_Error.html">DBG_N_Error</A> notification
to the debugger with the value field set to 0, and the register set filled
in. No further DosDebug commands will be accepted by the debuggee, nor will
it generate any other notifications.
<P>
If a <A HREF="689_L3_DBG_C_Stop.html">DBG_C_Stop</A> is issued, and a thread
owning a system semaphore is about to generate a <A HREF="718_L3_DBG_N_AsyncStop.html">DBG_N_AsyncStop
</A>notification, it will be allowed to continue execution until it releases
the semaphore. It will then be stopped, and the notification delivered.
This is the only exception to the severing of the debugger/debuggee rule.

<P>
If<I> Addr</I> is set to 0, the connection between the debugger the program
being debugged is severed if a system resource is being held,. in which
case<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 42 --> DosDebug</A> returns:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Tid<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= Thread owning semaphore<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Cmd<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= <A HREF="712_L3_DBG_N_Error.html">DBG_N_Error

</UL>Value<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>= ERROR_EXCL_SEM_ALREADY_OWNED<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the debugger needs to present some information to the user or use the
thread holding the system resource, the debugger must terminate the program
being debugged. Any other action might result in a system halt.
