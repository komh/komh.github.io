<H1>Storage Devices and File Systems</H1><!-- entering slot 972 -->
<P>
OS/2 file systems store information on mass storage devices. These devices
are usually hard disks or floppy diskettes, but can be other media, such
as CD-ROM.
<P>
Each drive (or device) is assigned a unique letter to distinguish it from
other drives. On most personal computers, drive A is the first floppy disk
drive, drive B is the second floppy disk drive, drive C is the first hard
disk drive, and drive D is the second hard disk drive.
<P>
A single hard disk can be divided into two or more partitions, each of which
are then viewed as a separate logical drive. A logical drive, like a physical
drive, is assigned a unique letter to distinguish it from other physical
and logical drives. FDISK is the OS/2 utility used to partition physical
storage devices.
<P>
A personal computer running the OS/2 operating system can have up to 26
logical disk drives.
<P>
Each logical storage device can be managed by a different file system. The
file system attached to a storage device manages that device. A user attaches
a file system to a storage device by:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Loading the file system driver during system initialization
(by including an IFS= statement in CONFIG.SYS).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Formatting the storage device by using the format
options for the file system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>During installation of the OS/2 operating system, users have the option
of formatting hard disks with the FAT file system or with the (HPFS). If
the user chooses to use the HPFS, an IFS= statement is added to the CONFIG.SYS
file so that HPFS is loaded automatically during each system startup. During
formatting, the file system driver is associated with the logical storage
device or drive letter of the hard disk.
<P>
When an application calls a file system function, the operating system directs
the request to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The installable file system managing the storage device,
or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The FAT file system, if no
installable file system is loaded and attached to the storage device.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The file system used to format the storage media manages that media each
time the system is started, as long as the file system is loaded during
system start-up. The operating system directs file system requests for a
storage media to the file system that formatted the media. If no file system
recognizes the format of the media, the OS/2 FAT file system attempts to
manage that media. This might occur when the file system used to format
the storage media is not loaded during system startup (the IFS= statement
was removed from the CONFIG.SYS file after OS/2 installation). If the OS/2
FAT file system cannot recognize the media format (the media might have
a different directory structure), the user receives an error when attempting
to access the media.
<P>
For example, assume a system is configured with diskette drive A and hard
disk drives C and D. During OS/2 installation, the user elects to format
drive C using HPFS. Drive C is, then, managed by HPFS. Drive D was formatted
with the FAT file system, so it is managed by the OS/2 FAT file system,
as is diskette drive A (removable media cannot be formatted using HPFS).
When an application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 40 --> DosOpen
</A>to open a file on drive C, the operating system directs the request
to HPFS. When an application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 40 --> DosOpen
</A>to open a file on drive A, the operating system directs the request
to the OS/2 FAT file system.
<P>
If HPFS is not loaded during system startup, the FAT file system will receive
file system requests made for drive C. However, because HPFS supports a
different directory structure than the FAT file system does, the OS/2 FAT
file system cannot recognize file objects on the disk. The user will receive
an error when attempting to gain access to the disk.
<P>
Users can determine which file system was used to format a storage device
by using the CHKDSK utility. CHKDSK displays a message indicating which
file system manages the specified drive. Because DOS does not use extended
attributes, a user must use CHKDSK in an OS/2 session rather than in a Dos
Session to examine a FAT partition.
