<H1>Initialization Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 1038 -->
<P>
The device driver does not attempt to initialize or support a port if it
does not get the INIT request packet for the port's corresponding device
name. If the physical device driver gets the INIT request packet for a given
device name, it checks to see if a valid I/O address is in the BIOS 40:
data area that corresponds to that device name. COM1 is in 40:0 and COM2
is in 40:2. If the 40: area does not have a valid I/O address, the physical
device driver fails the port and will not support the port. Otherwise, the
device driver attempts to get exclusively the interrupt level that corresponds
to the I/O address for the port. If the interrupt level is not available,
the physical device driver fails to initialize the port and will not support
the port.
<P>
If the interrupt level is available, the physical device driver relinquishes
the interrupt level. The physical device driver also initializes the port
and sets up support for the port during this startup of the operating system.

<P>
In summary, in order for the physical device driver to support a port, the
following must be TRUE:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The device driver must get an INIT request packet
for the device name.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The 40: area that corresponds to the device name must
have a valid I/O address.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The appropriate interrupt level must be available
for exclusive use, even though the physical device driver will not claim
the interrupt level for exclusive use during initialization.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The physical device driver claims ownership of the port by not deinstalling
the corresponding device name. Another device driver can cause this device
driver not to claim a port by initializing<I> before</I> this device driver,
and by doing at least one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Not allowing this physical device driver to receive
an INIT request packet for a given device name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Putting
an invalid I/O address in the corresponding 40: area (for example, 0)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Exclusively owning the appropriate interrupt
level at initialization time<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The device driver does not attempt to initialize or support a port if it
does not get the INIT request packet for the port's corresponding device
name. If the physical device driver gets the INIT request packet for a given
device name, it attempts to claim ownership of the specific LID position
for the ASYNC Device ID that corresponds to the device name being initialized.

<P>
For Micro Channel bus machines, if the LID is not available, the physical
device driver fails to initialize the port and does not support the port.
If the LID is available, the physical device driver initializes the port
and sets up support for the port during this startup of the operating system.
The LID for the port is relinquished; it is reclaimed during Open processing.

<P>
For the AT-bus machine, COM.SYS still installs even though the LID is not
present.
<P>
In summary, for the physical device driver to support a port on an IBM PS/2
computer, the following must be TRUE:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The physical device driver must get an INIT request
packet for the device name.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
ASYNC LID corresponding to the device name must be available.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The physical device driver claims ownership of the port by not deinstalling
the corresponding device name. Another device driver can cause this device
driver not to claim a port by initializing<I> before</I> this device driver
and doing at least one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Not allowing this device driver to receive an INIT
request packet for a given device name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Claiming
the appropriate ASYNC LID<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
