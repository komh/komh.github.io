<H1>Import Libraries</H1><!-- entering slot 807 -->
<P>
A conventional library contains object modules for a number of functions.
The library is a convenient way to manage a large number of modules and
use them in your executable code by linking to the library.  The Linker
uses the external references in your object module to determine which modules
must be pulled out of the library.
<P>
An import library does not contain any object modules.  Instead, the import
library contains information that tells the Linker what DLLs are used by
your application and the location of the functions your application uses
within each DLL.
<P>
Like a conventional library, an import library primarily is a convenience.
 Instead of specifying all the functions your application imports in its
module-definition file, you can link with the import library and let the
Linker resolve the external references in your object module.
<P>
You use import libraries every time you compile and link a program that
uses the OS/2 API.  All the OS/2 functions are implemented in DLLs, and
OS2386.LIB is an import library that tells the Linker where to find each
OS/2 function.
<P>
For more information about module-definition files and import libraries,
see the online Tools Reference in the OS/2 Warp Developer's Toolkit.
