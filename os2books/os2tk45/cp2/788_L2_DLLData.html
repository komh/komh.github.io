<H1>DLL Data</H1><!-- entering slot 802 -->
<P>
Most DLLs will contain some data.  Whereas DLL code is shared by all processes
that use it, DLL data can be shared or not shared by all processes that
use it.  Data that is specific to each process that uses the DLL (that is,
to each instance of the DLL) is called<I> instance data</I>.  Data that
is shared by all processes that use the DLL is called<I> shared</I> or<I> global
data</I>.
<P>
The first time a process references a DLL (and it is loaded or its usage
count is incremented because it is already loaded), a separate copy of the
DLL's instance data is created.  Modifications to the instance data for
one process do not affect the instance data for any other process.  The
system, however, maintains only one copy of a DLL's shared data for all
processes that use the DLL.  Every process that uses the DLL can access
the same data.  If one process modifies the data (increments a count, for
example), the data will be modified for all processes that use the DLL.

<P>
Because changes to shared DLL data by one process are visible to the DLL
code when called by another process, shared data provides DLLs with a mechanism
for tracking processes that use it.  This is crucial to subsystems, which
are DLLs that manage resources (for example, devices, queues, and so forth).

<P>
There usually is only one data and one code object, or segment, defined
in a C source file.  This means that a DLL that has instance and shared
data is built from more than one C source file, with a default automatic
data segment and with named data segments.  How data is defined is determined
by how the DLL is built.  A DLL is built like an application, using a DEF
file.  The DATA statement in a DEF file describes the attributes of application
or DLL data. Following is a list of the available options for the DATA statement:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Options<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Result<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MULTIPLE
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>OS/2 creates a unique copy of the automatic data
segment for each process that uses the DLL.  Modifications made by one process
do not affect any other process.  This is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SINGLE
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>OS/2 creates only one automatic data segment for
all processes that use the DLL.  If one process modifies the data, the data
will be modified for all processes that use the DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> READWRITE
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Enables you to read from or write to the automatic
data segment. This is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> READONLY<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Enables
you to read only from the automatic data segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LOADONCALL
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>The automatic data segment is loaded into memory
as needed.  This is the default.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> PRELOAD<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> The
automatic data segment is loaded as soon as a process accesses a DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
