<H1>Run-Time Dynamic Linking</H1><!-- entering slot 801 -->
<P>
When an application contains a reference to a DLL, the DLL is loaded into
memory when the application is loaded (unless the DLL already is in memory).
 If the application uses functions in several DLLs, all of those DLLs are
loaded into memory.  Some applications might use functions in several DLLs
but use only a few of them at any one time. For example, an application
that supports many different printers or plotters might use functions in
many DLLs but need only one of them at a time, depending on the printer
or plotter the application is supporting. If the user switches to a different
printer or plotter, another DLL will be used, but the first will remain
in memory.  Loading DLLs this way can be very wasteful.
<P>
To avoid this problem, applications can take advantage of run-time dynamic
linking and load and unload DLLs as they are required.  The process of building
a run-time dynamically linked application is similar to the process of building
a load-time dynamically linked application.  However, the EXE file for a
run-time dynamically linked application does not contain a record describing
where the external routines can be found.  Instead, the application explicitly
tells OS/2 when to load and free the dynamic link module.
<P>
Applications load and unload DLLs and call functions whose code resides
in those DLLs by:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Calling DosLoadModule to get a handle to the
DLL module.
<P>
This function also loads the DLL into memory or attaches to it, if it already
is loaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Calling DosQueryProcAddr to get a pointer to
a function within the DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Calling the function indirectly through the pointer
returned by DosQueryProcAddr.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Calling DosFreeModule to free the handle to the
DLL module.
<P>
When all handles to the DLL module have been freed, the DLL is unloaded
from memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application also can request information about a DLL from the system.
 The application can use the DosQueryModuleHandle function to determine
whether a DLL has been loaded into memory already.  The DosQueryModuleName
function returns full path information for the DLL file.
<P>

<P>
Following are the advantages of run-time dynamic linking:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Memory is consumed as needed.</B>
<P>
DLLs can be loaded and unloaded as they are used. Unused DLLs do not have
to be loaded into memory, and memory can be released when the application
has finished using the DLL.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B>Applications can recover from DLL NOT FOUND.</B>
<P>
Applications can make decisions.  If a load-time DLL cannot be found, the
application terminates immediately.  If a run-time DLL cannot be found,
the application receives an error value from the DosLoadModule function,
and it can use another DLL or specify a full path for the DLL.  If a function
is not available, the DosQueryProcAddr function returns an error value,
and the application can take appropriate action.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B>DLL and function names can be variable.</B>
<P>
An application programmer does not have to know the names of the DLLs the
application will be using or the names of the functions within the DLL.
 The application can read the names of the DLL or the functions from a configuration
file or obtain the names from user-supplied input.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B>DLLs can be anywhere.</B>
<P>
The application can specify the full path for the DLL.  Load-time DLLs must
be in a directory in the path specified by the LIBPATH environment variable,
but run-time DLLs can be in other directories.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
