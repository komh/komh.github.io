<P>
A process can send the XCPT_SIGNAL signal exception to another process by
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E2 C3 FC --> DosSendSignalException</A>.

<P>
In order for the specified process to receive the exception, it must have
an exception handler registered for Thread 1, and it must designate itself
as the signal focus for its screen group by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 FC --> DosSetSignalExceptionFocus</A>.

<P>
Presentation Manager applications cannot request exception focus for Ctrl+C
and Ctrl+Break. However, establishing an exception handler for Ctrl+C and
Ctrl+Break is supported for Vio-Window and full-screen applications.
