<H1>IOCtl Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 788 -->
<P>
Many devices have more than one operating mode. For example, a serial port
typically can operate at a variety of bit rates (sometimes called baud rates).
Because the modes are unique to each device, OS/2 does not include specific
functions to set or retrieve these modes. Instead OS/2 provides an I/O Control
(IOCtl) interface to enable applications to control devices by communicating
directly with the device driver.
<P>
The IOCtl interface is a method that an application or subsystem can use
to send device-specific control commands to a device driver. The IOCtl interface
function for OS/2 applications is<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC --> DosDevIOCtl</A>.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 29 -->DosDevIOCtl</A> provides a generic,
expandable IOCtl facility. Applications send commands and data to the device
driver with<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC --> DosDevIOCtl</A>. The OS/2
kernel reformats the generic IOCtl packets into request packets then calls
the device driver. The device driver then carries out the specified action.
IOCtl commands can be sent to both block and character device drivers.
<P>
Before using<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC --> DosDevIOCtl</A>, the
application or subsystem must first obtain the device handle by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 2A -->DosOpen</A> for the device name. The
opened device handle is used to specify the device the command is to go
to.
<P>
Refer to the<I> Control Program Programming Reference</I> for details of
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 FC -->DosDevIOCtl</A>.
