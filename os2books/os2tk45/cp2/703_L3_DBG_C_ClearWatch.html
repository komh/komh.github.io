<B>Returns</B>
<P>
This command clears a currently set or hit watchpoint.
<P>
If the watchpoint is not currently set, an error is returned.
<P>
If a debugger wishes to move a watchpoint from one location to another,
it should clear the old watchpoint before setting the new one, to free any
resources used by currently set watchpoints.
<P>
The watchpoint will be cleared even if it is currently hit, and a notification
is pending. To prevent missing the watchpoint hit in this way, you should
issue the <A HREF="689_L3_DBG_C_Stop.html">DBG_C_Stop</A> command just before
clearing the watchpoint, to pick up any pending watchpoint hit notifications.
