<P>
The module-definition file is an important tool for building DLLs. This
file contains information that tells OS/2 the name of the DLL, when to load
the DLL, how to manage memory for the DLL, and when to initialize the DLL.

<P>
When you create a DLL, the module-definition file must contain a list of
all the functions in the DLL that can be called by an application (or by
another DLL).  You specify these external functions by using an EXPORTS
statement in the module-definition file.
<P>
You also must tell the Linker where to find the external functions in your
application.  If the functions are in a DLL, you can use an IMPORTS statement
in the module-definition file for the application to tell the Linker where
to find the DLL functions.  You also can use an import library to tell the
Linker where to find your DLL functions.
