<P>
An application views a file as a logical sequence of data; OS/2 file systems
manage the physical locations of that data on the storage device for the
application. The file systems also manage file I/O operations and control
the format of the stored information.
<P>
Applications use the OS/2 file system functions to open, read, write, and
close disk files. File system functions also enable an application to use
and maintain the disk that contains the files-the volumes, the directories,
and the files on the disks of the computer. Applications also use OS/2 file
system functions to perform I/O operations to pipes and to peripheral devices
connected to the computer, like the printer.
