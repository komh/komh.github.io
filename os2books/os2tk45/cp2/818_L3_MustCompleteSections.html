<H1>Must-Complete Sections</H1><!-- entering slot 836 -->
<P>
A thread can defer the handling of<I> asynchronous</I> exceptions by creating
a<I> must-complete section</I>. A must-complete section is a section of
code that cannot be safely interrupted; it must be allowed to complete its
execution even if an asynchronous exception occurs while within its boundaries.
For example, a must-complete section can be used:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When modifying shared-memory data structures that
cannot be modified through an atomic operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Across database update operations<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->During a remote communications operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Creating a must-complete section ensures that the execution of critical
instructions will be completed and that resources will be cleaned up before
the thread ends. When used in conjunction with a<I> mutual exclusion (mutex)
semaphore</I>, a must-complete section also ensures that a thread will have
exclusive access to a resource.
<P>
The boundaries of the must-complete section are defined by<A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 3C --> DosEnterMustComplete
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 3D --> DosExitMustComplete</A> requests.
While a thread is executing instructions in a must-complete section, the
system will hold<I> asynchronous exceptions</I>, which include signal exceptions
and asynchronous process terminations.
<P>
The system increments a counter each time<A><!-- external link: 1D 7F C3 3C --> DosEnterMustComplete
</A>is called, and decrements the counter when<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 3D --> DosExitMustComplete
</A>is called.  Any asynchronous exceptions that have been held are dispatched
when the counter reaches 0.  A count greater than 1 indicates the degree
of nesting of the must-complete section. If<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 3D --> DosExitMustComplete
</A>is called when the count is already 0, ERROR_ALREADY_RESET is returned.

<P>
The handling of<I> synchronous</I> system exceptions and user-defined exceptions
is not deferred by the system. To defer the handling of these exceptions,
a procedure typically registers an exception handler (by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C3 FC --> DosSetExceptionHandler</A>)
and initializes a local<I> Raise Exception</I> flag to 0 before entering
the must-complete section. The flag is set to 1, and the information is
stored, if the exception handler receives a synchronous exception that it
wants to reraise later.
<P>
If the value of the<I> raise exception</I> flag is 0 after the thread exits
from the must-complete section, then no exceptions occurred, and the thread
continues its normal operation.
<P>
If the value of the flag is 1 after the must-complete section has been completed,
then an exception occurred, and the thread must call<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 3E --> DosRaiseException
</A>to raise the deferred exception for handling.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A thread must not call a function that is outside the scope
of the must-complete section (for example, a DLL routine), because an error
in the called routine could cause the process to end without returning.
Keep must-complete sections as short as possible.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
