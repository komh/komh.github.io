<H1>Accessing Devices</H1><!-- entering slot 785 -->
<P>
OS/2 applications usually communicate with devices through OS/2. Some devices,
like the screen, have their own set of supporting functions. Most other
devices can be accessed by using the standard OS/2 file system functions-
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC -->DosOpen</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC -->DosWrite</A>, and<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> DosClose</A>.
Using the file system functions, an application can open and access the
device just as it would a disk file. Using the file system also enables
applications to redirect the device's I/O stream.
<P>
Sometimes however, these higher-level approaches do not suffice. For these
situations, OS/2 provides several functions that interface with devices
at a lower level.<A><!-- external link: 1D 79 C3 1E --> DosDevConfig</A> is
used to retrieve information about the devices available.<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C3 21 --> DosPhysicalDisk
</A>can be used to retrieve information about a partitionable hard disk.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7A C3 1F -->DosDevIOCtl</A> is used to send device-specific
commands directly to a particular device driver.
