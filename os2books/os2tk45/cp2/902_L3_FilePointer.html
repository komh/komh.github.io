<H1>File Pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 923 -->
<P>
Every open file has a file pointer that specifies the next byte to be read
or the location to receive the next byte that is written. When a file is
first opened, the system places the file pointer at the beginning of the
file. As each byte is read or written, OS/2 advances the pointer.
<P>
An application can also move the pointer by using<A><!-- external link: 1D EB C3 FC --> DosSetFilePtr</A>.
When the pointer reaches the end of the file and the application attempts
to read from the file, no bytes are read and no error occurs. Thus, reading
0 bytes without an error means the program has reached the end of the file.

<P>
When an application writes to a disk file, the data being written is usually
collected in an internal buffer. OS/2 writes to the disk only when the amount
of data equals (or is a multiple of) the sector size of the disk. If there
is data in the internal buffer when the file is closed, the system automatically
writes the data to the disk before closing the file. An application can
also flush the buffer (that is, write the contents of the buffer to the
disk) by using<A><!-- external link: 1D DC C3 FC --> DosResetBuffer</A>.
