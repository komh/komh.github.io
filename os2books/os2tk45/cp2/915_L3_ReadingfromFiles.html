<H1>Reading from Files</H1><!-- entering slot 938 -->
<P>
Once you open a file or have a file handle, you can read from and write
to the file by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 37 --> DosRead</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC -->DosWrite</A>.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 37 -->DosRead</A> is called with a handle
(obtained with<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>) for a
file, pipe, or device.<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 37 --> DosRead</A> copies
a specified number of bytes (up to the end of the file) from the file object
to the buffer you specify. OS/2 returns, in a parameter, the number of bytes
actually read (which might not be the same as the number of bytes requested
because the end of the file might have been reached).
<P>
To read from a file, you must open it for reading or for reading and writing.

<P>

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to open the file named SAMPLE.TXT
and read the first 512 bytes from it:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define BUF_SIZE 512

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction;
    BYTE    abBuffer[BUF_SIZE];
    ULONG   cbRead;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen("SAMPLE.TXT",
                   &amp;hf,
                   &amp;ulAction,
                   0,
                   FILE_NORMAL,
                   FILE_OPEN,
                   OPEN_ACCESS_READONLY |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE,
                   (PEAOP2) NULL);

    if (!ulrc) {
        DosRead(hf,
                abBuffer,
                sizeof(abBuffer),
                &amp;cbRead);

        DosClose(hf);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
If the file does not have 512 bytes,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 37 --> DosRead
</A>reads to the end of the file and puts the number of bytes read in the
<I>cbRead</I> variable. If the file pointer is already positioned at the
end of the file when<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 37 --> DosRead</A> is
called, the function puts a 0 in the<I> cbRead</I> variable.
