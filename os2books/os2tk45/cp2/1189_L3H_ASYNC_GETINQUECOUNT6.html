<UL> Binary integer
with the number of received characters in the device driver receive queue.
This is a memory buffer between the memory pointed to by the READ request
packet and the receive hardware for this COM device.  The application cannot
assume that there are no unsatisfied Read requests if there are characters
in the device driver receive queue.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The behavior of data movement between the Read request and
the receive queue can change with each release of the physical device driver.
 Applications should not have a dependency on this information.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
