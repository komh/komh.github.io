<P>
A watchpoint has been hit. The Watchpoint ID number identifies the watchpoint
that was hit.
<P>
Multiple watchpoint hits become pending notifications that are returned
on subsequent <A HREF="689_L3_DBG_C_Stop.html">DBG_C_Stop</A>, <A HREF="686_L3_DBG_C_Go.html">DBG_C_Go</A>,
or <A HREF="688_L3_DBG_C_SStep.html">DBG_C_SStep</A> commands. A watchpoint
may be hit at any time, and more than one watchpoint may be hit at the same
time.
<P>
If a watchpoint notification is pending, the resources used by the watchpoint
will not be freed until the watchpoint notification is complete, or the
watchpoint is cleared.
<P>
A watchpoint notification is not always returned by the same thread that
caused the hit. A watchpoint may be hit by one thread, but another thread
may return the notification. The thread ID of the thread that hit the watchpoint
is not necessarily the value passed in the Tid field.
<P>
Data Watchpoint hits are treated as faults, rather than as traps, by the
80386 processor. Therefore, the linearized instruction pointer may not point
to the exact instruction that caused the fault.
<P>
If a watchpoint is hit at interrupt time, the Value, Addr, MTE, and Len
fields are all returned as zero.
