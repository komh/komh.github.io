<H1>Error Alert Generation</H1><!-- entering slot 1008 -->
<P>
The ASYNC physical device driver supports SNA Generic Alerts by generating
Error Alerts, as defined under the OS/2 Logging Facility. Alerts are generated
by the ASYNC driver whenever the OS/2 Logging Facility is enabled by the
user at system initialization time.
<P>
Alerts may be generated only while the COM port is open and is processing
a Write request (transmitting data). Write Timeout mode must be normal.
(If Infinite Timeout mode is enabled, timeouts do not occur.) Error Alerts
can be generated only when a Write Timeout occurs while waiting for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CTS to be asserted, when Transmit is disabled because
CTS is inactive. The Output Handshaking Using CTS mode must be enabled for
this alert-generating condition to occur. This mode is enabled by default
in the physical ASYNC device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DSR to be asserted, when Transmit is disabled because
DSR is inactive. The Output Handshaking Using DSR mode must be enabled for
this alert-generating condition to occur. This mode is enabled by default
in the physical ASYNC device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DCD to be asserted, when Transmit is disabled because
DCD is inactive. The Output Handshaking Using DCD mode must be enabled for
this alert-generating condition to occur. This mode must be enabled by an
application. It is not enabled by default in the ASYNC device driver.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An XON to be received, when Transmit is disabled because
an XOFF is received.  Automatic Transmit Flow Control mode must be enabled
for this alert-generating condition to occur.  This mode must be enabled
by an application.  It is not enabled by default in the ASYNC device driver.
