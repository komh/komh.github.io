<B>Signal Exceptions</B>
<P>
An OS/2 Version 2.X application may receive three signals:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR (Ctrl+C)<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
XCPT_SIGNAL_KILLPROC (<A><!-- external link: 1D 9A C3 4B -->DosKillProcess</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
XCPT_SIGNAL_BREAK (Ctrl+Break).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The signal being sent may be determined by examining the exception information
in the ExceptionReportRecord.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Exception Code:<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> XCPT_SIGNAL (0xC0010003)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

XCPT_SIGNAL is called a "signal exception" and is sent only to thread 1
in the process receiving the exception. This is consistent with 16-bit signals,
and provides greater consistency in the environment of the process for handling
the various asynchronous exceptions. For example, since a repeated typematic
Ctrl+C could possibly cause the thread to recursively process the exception
and consume stack space without ever being able to handle the first "signal",
the exception dispatcher "holds" each exception of the same type until a
handler either returns XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION to the exception dispatcher,
or the process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 4A --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException
</A>for that signal. Only one signal or exception is actually held (they
are not queued by the system).
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 4A -->DosAcknowledgeSignalException</A> indicates
to the system that the process wants to receive the XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR and
XCPT_SIGNAL_BREAK signals. Previously, when a process called<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 4A --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException
</A>the system noted that the process was aware of the particular signal
for which it was registering the handler. When a process called<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 FC --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException</A>,
it became a candidate for the "signal focus" for its session. At any point
in time, the focus for a session is the last process to register a signal
handler for that signal. When the user presses Ctrl+C on the keyboard, the
system delivers an XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR signal to the current keyboard focus.
The user could also press Ctrl+Break to deliver an XCPT_SIGNAL_BREAK signal,
but this would only work if input were in raw mode.
<P>
Note that all exception handlers (on thread 1) must be prepared to "see"
signal exceptions. It is always possible that a previous handler has issued
DosSetSignalExceptionFocus, or that a Dos16SetSigHandler has been issued
by some 16-bit code in the path. They can always be ignored by returning
XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH to the exception dispatcher. Note that signals result
in a call to the 16-bit signal handler (if installed) if all the 32-bit
exception handlers return XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 4C -->DosSetSession</A> performs the function
of assigning the signal focus exactly as if the application had called<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 4A --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException
</A>twice, once for each signal. The process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 4C --> DosSetSession
</A>when it wants to indicate that it expects to receive XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR
or XCPT_SIGNAL_BREAK after it has registered an exception handler to process
the signal when it comes. Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 4C --> DosSetSession
</A>increments a counter in the PTDA of the process. When the system attempts
to send XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR or XCPT_SIGNAL_BREAK to a process, it first checks
to see if either this counter is greater than zero, or if the process has
registered a 16-bit signal handler for that signal. If either of these is
true, the signal will be sent. If the process has registered both 16-bit
and 32-bit handlers, the 32-bit handlers are called first. If they do not
handle the signal, the 16-bit handlers are called. If the 32-bit handlers
are called and do not handle the signal, and there are no 16-bit handlers,
the process is terminated.
