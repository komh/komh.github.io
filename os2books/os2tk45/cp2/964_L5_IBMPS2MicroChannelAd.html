<P>
The physical device driver supports a maximum of four ASYNC ports on a maximum
of two different interrupt levels. The interrupt levels must have ABIOS
support, with one unit per Logical ID (LID) for the ASYNC Device ID. The
only ASYNC devices supported on IBM PS/2 and the Extended Industry Standard
Architecture (EISA) machines are COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4. These devices
correspond to the first four LIDs in the ABIOS common data area that have
the architected ASYNC Device ID. These devices also correspond to the first
four ASYNC addresses in the ROM BIOS 40: data area.
<P>
If a device has capabilities other than ASYNC that cannot be utilized independently
of the ASYNC capabilities (for example, as in the Advanced BIOS separate
LID architecture), and if Advanced BIOS assigns the device the ASYNC Device
ID, then that device can be used only for ASYNC in that power-on session.

<P>
If the device is assigned the ASYNC Device ID, and it has additional capabilities
beyond supporting the RS232-C port (for example, a built-in modem), the
physical device driver does not recognize those additional capabilities
(and potential limitations). Also, the physical device driver does not inform
any application program of those additional capabilities or limitations.
In addition, it does not limit the control of the RS232-C interface or the
device to only those modes that are acceptable to the extended hardware
capabilities of that RS232-C port.
<P>
If the device is not assigned the ASYNC Device ID, it is not supported by
this physical device driver. If an ASYNC device is not supported by the
OS/2 operating system, but is recognized by Advanced BIOS as an ASYNC Device
ID, the physical device driver can recognize and try to use that unsupported
device, if it is COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4.
