<P>
When the physical device driver processes a WRITE request packet, it can
be with Normal or Infinite Timeout processing. With Normal Timeout processing
if no data is given to the transmit hardware within a specified amount of
time, the request is completed. With Infinite Timeout processing, the request
is completed only when all the data from the request has been given to the
transmit hardware.
<P>
Error Alerts can be generated on the occurrence of Write Timeout, if the
OS/2 Logging Facility is enabled. In order for an error alert to be generated
by the physical ASYNC device driver, the appropriate mode of operation must
be enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
