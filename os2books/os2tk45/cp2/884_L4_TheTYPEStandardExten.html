<H1>The .TYPE Standard Extended Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 905 -->
<P>
The .TYPE extended attribute (EA) indicates the file-type of the file object
it is associated with. It is similar to a file name extension.
<P>
The name of this EA consists of the string ".TYPE". The value of this EA
contains the file object's file-type. The following file types are predefined:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Plain text<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
OS/2 command file<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
DOS command file<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Executable<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Metafile<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Bit map<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

Dynamic link library<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

C code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

Pascal code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

BASIC code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
COBOL code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
FORTRAN code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Assembler code<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Library<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Resource file<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Object code<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Data files only require identification of the file type. For data files
without EAs, the file type is derived from the file extension, if there
is one.
<P>
File object types are represented as length-preceded ASCII strings, uniquely
identifying the file object's type. This identifier is referenced within
the application's .ASSOCTABLE EA in order to bind the data file type to
the application. It is important that this name be a unique identifier because
all file type names are public data. For example, if application A and application
B both had a type name of SPREADSHEET, the filing system would not be able
to identify A's SPREADSHEET from B's SPREADSHEET.
<P>
The recommended convention for defining file object types is:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Company_name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Application_name
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Application-specific_name<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example, spreadsheet files generated by My_Application written by My_Company
might have a file object type of the following.
<PRE>    My_Company My_Application Spreadsheet
</PRE>

<P>
Type names must be ASCII characters and case is significant.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The performance of extended attributes is dependent on the
file system. Because some file systems store extended attributes in first-in/first-out
(FIFO) order, it is important to write the .TYPE entry first so OS/2 can
access that information quickly.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
