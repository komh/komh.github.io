<H1>Creating Files</H1><!-- entering slot 934 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 51 -->DosOpen</A> is used to create files,
which  are then read from or written to. To create a file, specify FILE_CREATE
as the sixth argument in the call to the function. DosOpen then creates
the file, if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, the
function returns the error value FILE_EXISTED.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to use DosOpen to create the file
NEWFILE.TXT:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen("NEWFILE.TXT",       /* Name of file to create and open */
                   &amp;hf,                 /* Address of file handle          */
                   &amp;ulAction,           /* Action taken                    */
                   0,                   /* Size of new file                */
                   FILE_NORMAL,         /* File attributes                 */
                   FILE_CREATE,         /* Creates the file                */
                   OPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE,
                   (PEAOP2) NULL);      /* No extended attributes          */

</PRE>

<P>
In this example,<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 51 --> DosOpen</A> creates
the file and opens it for writing only. Note that the sharing method chosen
permits other processes to open the file for any access. The new file is
empty (contains no data).
<P>
When you use DosOpen to create (or replace) a file, you must specify the
attributes the new file is to have. In the preceding example, this value
is FILE_NORMAL, so the file is created as a normal file. Other possible
file attributes include read-only and hidden, which correspond to FILE_READONLY
and FILE_HIDDEN, respectively. The possible file attributes are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
File Attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Defined Constant<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Normal file<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_NORMAL<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Read-only file<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_READONLY<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Hidden file<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_HIDDEN<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>System file<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_SYSTEM<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Subdirectory<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_DIRECTORY<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Archived file<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> FILE_ARCHIVED.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The file attribute affects how other processes access the file. For example,
if the file is read-only, no process can open the file for writing. There
is one exception-the process that creates the read-only file can write to
it immediately after creating it. After closing the file, however, the process
cannot reopen it for writing.
<P>
If you are creating a new file object (a new file or a replacement for an
existing one), you must specify the size of the new file in bytes. For example,
if you specify 256, the file size is 256 bytes. However, these 256 bytes
are undefined. If the file being opened already exists, the file size parameter
is ignored. It is up to the application to write valid data to the file.
No matter what size you specify, the file pointer is set to point to the
beginning of the file so a subsequent call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 53 --> DosWrite
</A>starts writing data at the beginning of the file.
<P>
Extended attributes can be defined by an application when a file object
is created. An application can define an extended attribute for a file when
the file is created during a<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 51 --> DosOpen
</A>call.
<P>
Applications can also control access to specific regions within a file by
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D EA C3 FC --> DosSetFileLocks</A>.
