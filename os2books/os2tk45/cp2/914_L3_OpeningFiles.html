<H1>Opening Files</H1><!-- entering slot 935 -->
<P>
Before performing input or output operations on a file, you must open the
file and obtain a file handle. You obtain a file handle by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.
This function opens the specified file and returns a file handle for it.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 55 -->DosOpen</A> can also be used to create
new  files.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 55 -->DosOpen</A> establishes a connection
betwee n a file object and an application. This connection is in the form
of a 32-bit identifier called a<I> file handle</I>, which is used to refer
to the file object and any information associated with it. DosOpen returns
a handle that is used in other file system calls to gain access to the object.
The file object can be a new file, an existing file, or a replacement for
an existing file. It can also be a character device, a block device, or
the client end of a named pipe. The type of object is determined by the
file name you pass to DosOpen.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the object is a named pipe, it must be in a listening state
for DosOpen to be successful.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment shows the use of DosOpen to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open the existing file SAMPLE.TXT for reading<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Put the file handle into the<I> hf</I> variable<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen("SAMPLE.TXT",       /* Name of file to open      */
                   &amp;hf,                /* Address of file handle    */
                   &amp;ulAction,          /* Action taken              */
                   0,                  /* Size of file              */
                   FILE_NORMAL,        /* File attribute            */
                   FILE_OPEN,          /* Open the file             */
                   OPEN_ACCESS_READONLY |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE,
                   (PEAOP2) NULL);     /* Extended attribute buffer */

</PRE>

<P>
If DosOpen successfully opens the file, it copies the file handle to the
<I>hf</I> variable and copies a value to the<I> ulAction</I> variable indicating
what action was taken (for example, FILE_EXISTED for "existing file opened").
A file size is not needed to open an existing file, so the fourth argument
is 0. The fifth argument, FILE_NORMAL, specifies the normal file attribute.
The sixth argument, FILE_OPEN, directs DosOpen to open the file if it exists
or return an error if it does not exist. The seventh argument directs DosOpen
to open the file for reading only and enables other applications to open
the file even while the current application has it open. The final argument
is a pointer to a structure containing information on extended attributes.
If the file has no extended attributes, this argument must be NULL.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 55 -->DosOpen</A> returns 0 if it successfully
op ens the file. Applications use the file handle in subsequent functions
to read data from the file or to check the status and other file characteristics.
If DosOpen fails to open the file, it returns an error value.
<P>
When you open a file you must specify whether you want to read from the
file, write to it, or both read and write. Also, since more than one application
might attempt to open the same file, you must also specify whether you want
to allow other processes to have access to the file while you have it open.
A file that is shared can be shared for reading only, writing only, or reading
and writing. A file that is not shared cannot be opened by another application
(or more than once by the first application) until it has been closed by
the first application.
<P>
An application defines its file access rights (that is, I/O it needs to
perform on a file) by<!-- entering slot 936 --> setting the appropriate
file access mode field in the file open-mode parameter. An application accesses
a file as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Read-only<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Write-only<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Read/write<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application defines what I/O operations other processes can perform on
a file by setting the appropriate sharing mode field in the<I> OpenMode
</I>parameter. Other processes are granted:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Deny read/write access<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Deny
write access<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Deny read access<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Deny neither read or write access (deny none)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
File sharing requires cooperation between the sharing processes. For example,
if process A calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 57 --> DosOpen</A> to
open a file with Deny Write sharing and process B calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 57 --> DosOpen
</A>to open the same file with Read/Write access, the DosOpen call made
by process B fails.
<P>
You indicate whether or not you want to permit another application to access
your file by combining an OPEN_ACCESS_ value and an OPEN_SHARE_ value from
the following list:

<P>
In general, you can combine any access method (read, write, or read and
write) with any sharing method (deny reading, deny writing, deny reading
and writing, or grant any access). Some combinations have to be handled
carefully, however, such as opening a file for writing without denying other
processes access to it.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For named pipes, the access and sharing modes must be consistent
with those specified by<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>.

<P>
See the DosOpen material in the<I> Control Program Programming Reference
</I>for details of these characteristics.
<P>
After an object has<!-- entering slot 937 --> been opened, its file handle
state flags can be queried by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C3 17 --> DosQueryFHState
</A>and reset by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C3 FC --> DosSetFHState</A>.
See <A HREF="920_L3_DeterminingandSettin.html">Determining and Setting the
State of a File or Device Handle</A> for information on determining the
state of a file handle.
<P>
When a child process inherits a file handle, it also inherits the sharing
and access rights of the file.
<P>
You cannot use metacharacters (global file name characters; * and ?) in
file names you supply to DosOpen.
