<H1>FAT File System</H1><!-- entering slot 966 -->
<P>
The OS/2 FAT file system is based on the DOS FAT file system. This file
system, also used in previous releases of the OS/2 operating system and
in PC-DOS, controls storage of data files for hard and floppy disks.
<P>
The FAT file system is hierarchical, supporting multiple directories on
the disk. Each directory can contain one or more files or subdirectories.

<P>
The FAT file system uses the 8.3 file name convention. Under this convention,
the file name consists of a file name of up to eight characters, a separating
period (.),  and a file name extension of up to three characters.
