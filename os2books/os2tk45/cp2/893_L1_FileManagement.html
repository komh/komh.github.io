<P>
OS/2 provides a standard set of file system functions. This means that applications
can create, open, read, write, copy, and delete files and directories by
using the same functions, regardless of which file system is used. When
an application calls a file system function, OS/2 passes the request to
the dynamic link library that supports the file system. The dynamic link
library carries out most file system processing, such as validating file
names. If an error occurs, the file system returns the error to OS/2, which
then passes it back to the calling application.
<P>
The OS/2 file system functions identify files and directories by their names.
These functions store or search for the file or directory in the current
directory on the current drive unless the name explicitly specifies a different
directory and drive. Occasionally, a file system has control functions in
addition to the standard file system functions. The control functions are
specific to the given file system. An application can call a control function
by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC --> DosFSCtl</A>, which directs
OS/2 to pass the control-function information to the corresponding Installable
File System (IFS).
