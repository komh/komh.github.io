<P>
This function is used to perform the operations specified on the physical
drive in this request.  This is similar to the Category 08h commands, except
that the I/O is done offset from the beginning of the physical drive instead
of from the beginning of the extended volume associated with the unit number
(Category 08h).
<P>
The Track Layout Table passed in the Parameter Packet is used to determine
the sector number, which is passed on to the disk controller for the operation.
 In cases where the sectors are oddly numbered or are non-consecutive, this
request breaks into<I> n</I> single sector operations and writes one sector
at a time. The sector table that is specified provides information that
is used during the WRITE track operation.
