<H1>Creating a Subdirectory</H1><!-- entering slot 917 -->
<P>
To create a new subdirectory, an application calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 6D C3 17 --> DosCreateDir
</A>and specifies a directory path name. If the call is successful, a new
subdirectory is created at the end of the path on the specified disk. If
no path name is specified, a new subdirectory is created at the end of the
current directory for the process. If any subdirectories in the path do
not exist, the subdirectory is not created.
<P>
Because a subdirectory is a file object, an application also can define
an extended attribute for the directory when it is created during this call.
See <A HREF="862_L1_ExtendedAttributes.html">Extended Attributes</A> for
more information on extended attributes.
