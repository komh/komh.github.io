<H1>Kernel Debugger Communications Protocol</H1><!-- entering slot 738 -->
<P>
The Kernel Debugger is essentially a replacement OS/2 Kernel module that
contains a built-in debugger component.  The kernel debugger can be used
to halt system execution, inspect and alter memory and registers, and display
system control blocks.  The kernel debugger is described in detail in<I> The
OS/2 Debugging Handbook - Volume II</I>, IBM publication number SG24-4641.

<P>
Generally the kernel debugger communicates over a serial communications
link with a terminal emulator program running on another machine.  This
allows a user to debug a problem by issuing kernel debugger commands in
the emulator program and seeing the results displayed on the debug console.

<P>
To automate the debugging process, or to provide a high-level language debugging
environment, this interaction with the kernel debugger could instead be
handled by a program running on the other machine.  This<B> debug engine
</B>would interact with the user, convert the user's debugging request to
a series of kernel debugger commands, issue them, and then present the response
from the kernel debugger back to the user in a user-friendly format.
<P>
Communications between the debug engine and the kernel debugger can proceed
in one of two modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
raw (dumb TTY) mode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> ASCII characters are sent to
the kernel debugger one at a time. The kernel debugger echoes each character.
 A carriage return (^M or 0x0d) ends a line.  The kernel debugger returns
data to the debug engine one ASCII character at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> packet
mode<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Packets are sent to the kernel debugger.  A
packet consists of a fixed sized header followed by zero or more bytes of
data.  The kernel debugger returns data to the debug engine in packets.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
