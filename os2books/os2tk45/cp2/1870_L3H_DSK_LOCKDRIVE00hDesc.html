<P>
This function locks a drive and is used to exclude I/O by another process
on the volume in the drive.  The Lock Drive function succeeds only if there
is one file handle open on the volume in the drive (that is, the file handle
on which this function is issued).  This is necessary because the desired
result is to exclude all other I/O to this volume until "Function 01h -
Unlock Drive" is issued.
