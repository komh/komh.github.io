<P>
The achievable performance is very sensitive to the environment. The type
and amount of other system activity determine the achievable performance.
On the IBM PS/2 system, the number of COM ports or other devices on the
same interrupt level significantly affects the achievable performance level.

<P>
Trying to receive data at too high a bit rate could cause<I> hardware overrun
</I>errors or<I> receive queue overrun</I> errors. Receive queue overrun
errors are easily solved by adjusting the communications protocol to the
size of the physical device driver receive queue. Trying to transmit data
at too high a bit rate could also cause the performance of the operating
system to be severely reduced.
<P>
The bit rate can be set with the MODE command or with an IOCtl. The bit
rate should not be set to values that might cause receive overruns or adverse
OS/2 system performance effects.
