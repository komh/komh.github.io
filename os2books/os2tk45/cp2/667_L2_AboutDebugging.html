<H1>About Debugging</H1><!-- entering slot 676 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 1D -->DosDebug</A>  enables one application
to control the execution of another application for debugging purposes.

<P>
An application is selected for debugging when it is started.<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 1E --> DosExecPgm
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 20 --> DosStartSession</A> both have
flags that can be used to specify that the application being started is
to be controlled by the starting application.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 1E -->DosExecPgm</A> starts an application
within a new process.<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 20 --> DosStartSession
</A>starts a new session within which one or more processes can be executing.
See<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 20 --> DosStartSession</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 1E --> DosExecPgm
</A>for details on how to start an application for debugging purposes. For
information on processes and sessions, see<A><!-- external link: 1D 40 C6 49 --> Program
Execution Control</A> in this book.
<P>
Once a process has been selected for debugging,<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 1D --> DosDebug
</A> is used to control its execution and to examine and manipulate its
variables.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 1D -->DosDebug</A>  provides a full set
of debugging commands, including execution control commands-like single
stepping and setting watchpoints-and commands to examine and manipulate
the memory and registers of the process being debugged. The debugger process
can access specific threads within a process being debugged and specific
processes within a session being debugged.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C3 1D -->DosDebug</A>  also has a rich set
of notification messages to keep the debugger application informed of activities
occurring during the execution of the application being debugged.
<P>
The debugger application can use the session and process control functions
described in<A><!-- external link: 1D 40 C6 49 --> Program Execution Control
</A>to control the child process or session being debugged. For example,
the debugger can use<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 1F --> DosSelectSession
</A>to switch itself, or the session being debugged, to the foreground.
