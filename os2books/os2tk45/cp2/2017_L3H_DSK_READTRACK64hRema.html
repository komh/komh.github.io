<P>
This function is used to perform a read of sectors on the media and to perform
the operations on the device that is specified in this request. The track
table passed in on the call is used to determine the sector number, which
is passed to the disk controller for the operation.  In cases where the
sectors are oddly numbered or are non-consecutive, this request breaks into
<I>n</I> single sector operations and reads one sector at a time. This DosDevIOCtls
is typically used when performing I/O outside of the normal file system
data area on the media.
