<H1>PTR_GETPTRDRAWADDRESS (72h) - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1303 -->
<P>
This function is used by the mouse subsystem to obtain the entry point address
of the pointer draw routine.  The pointer draw routine is contained within
the physical Pointer Draw device driver.  It is called by the physical Mouse
device driver to update the pointer image on the screen.  The Far-16 address
returned by Function 72h is passed by the mouse subsystem to the physical
mouse device driver through an IOCtl interface.  See <A HREF="1633_L2_Category07hMouseCont.html">Category
07h Mouse Control IOCtl Commands</A>.  The physical mouse device driver
saves the Far-16 address passed and uses it when calling the pointer draw
routine.
<P>
This function is supported by the physical Pointer Draw device driver.
