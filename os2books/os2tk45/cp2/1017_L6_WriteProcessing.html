<P>
The physical device driver begins processing Write requests in the order
it received them. Notice that this might not be the same order that the
requests were issued by the application. If the physical device driver receives
more than one Write request, the request is queued on the Write request
queue for later processing. Applications might not see Write requests complete
in the order they were issued. The order of the data transmitted due to
the Write requests reflects the order that the requests were received by
the physical device driver.
<P>
The data from the Write requests is placed in the physical device driver
transmit queue. The number of characters written is considered to be the
number of characters given to the transmit hardware, and not the number
of characters placed in the physical device driver transmit queue. Because
of timeout processing, it is possible that the total number of Write characters
requested will not be transmitted. This is not considered an error. The
request is completed when it times out or when the amount of data requested
is given to the transmit hardware (but not actually transmitted at the physical
RS232-C interface). Write Timeout processing is discussed in <A HREF="981_L4_StatesoftheASYNCDevi.html">States
of the ASYNC Device Driver</A>.
<P>
If infinite Write Timeout processing is enabled, it is the responsibility
of the application to monitor the status of the Write requests. The application
might have to issue an IOCtl to disable infinite Write Timeout processing
to cause the Write request to be completed (without all the data being transmitted).
If an application does not check that all the data is given to the transmit
hardware on each Write request, use the infinite timeout processing mode
of the physical device driver to ensure that all the data has been given
to the<I> transmit</I> hardware before the request is completed. To increase
the throughput (ratio of number of characters transmitted per second to
the bit rate), the application should keep the Write requests as large as
possible.
