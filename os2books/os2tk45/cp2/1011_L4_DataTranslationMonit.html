<H1>Data Translation/Monitor Support/Spooler Support</H1><!-- entering slot 1039 -->
<P>
The physical device driver provides no data translation, code page, or monitor
support. It is the responsibility of the application or subsystem to provide
any function required in these areas.
<P>
Spooling from LPT to COM is supported by the spooler, but spooling from
COM to LPT, or COM to COM, is not supported. When spooling from COM to LPT,
code page support is provided by the spooler.
<P>
Any requests for registering or opening a monitor chain to COM<I>n</I> are
rejected by the physical device driver. The physical device driver deals
with binary data and provides no special processing of<I> binary</I> or
<I>ASCII</I> data streams.
