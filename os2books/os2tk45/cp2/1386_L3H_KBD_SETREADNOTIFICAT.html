<P>
Sets the DDFlags of a key packet, instructing the keyboard device driver
to send a special monitor packet down the monitor chain.  This packet is
sent on every Read request seen by the physical keyboard device driver for
a particular screen group, and continues until the screen group is terminated
or a subsequent call disables Read Notification.
<P>
The Process ID (PID) of the first caller of this IOCtl in the system is
saved by the physical Keyboard device driver.  Subsequent invocations of
this IOCtl by a different PID result in an UNKNOWN_COMMAND error.
