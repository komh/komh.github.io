<H1>KBD_ALTERKBDLED (5Ah) - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1439 -->
<P>
Alters the keyboard LEDs without changing the operational state of the keyboard's
mode of scan code generation.  This IOCtl is reserved for use by the Presentation
Manager session system and cannot be called by applications.  Requests from
applications return an UNKNOWN_COMMAND error.
<P>
Because it is not possible to separate the keyboard's LED and operational
state for the 88/89-Key Enhanced Keyboard, the physical Keyboard device
driver performs no operations for IOCtl requests received when the 88/89-Key
Enhanced keyboard is the attached system keyboard.
