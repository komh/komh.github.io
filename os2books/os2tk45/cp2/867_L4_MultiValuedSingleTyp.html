<H1>Multi-Valued, Single-Type Data Type</H1><!-- entering slot 887 -->
<P>
This data type indicates that the value of a single extended attribute (EA)
contains several pieces of information, each of the same data type.  For
example:
<PRE>    EAT_MVST  Codepage  NumEntries  Data_Type  [data] ...
    WORD      WORD      WORD        WORD

</PRE>

<P>
The first word indicates that the EA value is multi-valued, single-typed.
The second word indicates the code page associated with the language in
which the EA value is written. The third word indicates the number of entries
contained in this EA value. The next word indicates the data type of all
the entries contained in this EA value, followed by the data for all entries.

<P>
For example, the following EA value contains three ASCII names:
<PRE>    EAT_MVST 0000 0003 EAT_ASCII 0004 Mark
                                 0005 Ellen
                                 0003 Liz

</PRE>

<P>
Each name string is preceded by the length of the string. Whether or not
the data is length-preceded is a function of the data type.
