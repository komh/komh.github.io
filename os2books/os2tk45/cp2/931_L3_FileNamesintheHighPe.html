<H1>File Names in the High Performance File System</H1><!-- entering slot 954 -->
<P>
In HPFS, file names can be up to 255 characters long (one must be a terminating
NULL, "\0"). Directory names can also be 255 characters long, but the length
of the complete path, including drive, directories, and file name, cannot
exceed 260 characters.
<P>
Certain characters that are illegal in the FAT file system are legal in
HPFS file names:
<PRE>    +   =   ;   ,   [   ]
</PRE>

<P>
Also, blank spaces can be used anywhere in an HPFS file name or directory
name, but blank spaces and periods at the end of a file name are ignored.
Additionally, the period (.) is a valid file name character and can be used
as many times as desired. There is no requirement that HPFS file names have
extensions; however, many applications still create and use them.
<P>
An HPFS file name can be all uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed case. The
case is preserved for directory listings but is ignored in file searches
and all other system operations. Therefore, in a given directory, there
cannot be more than one file with the same name when the only difference
is case.

<B>File-Naming Rules for Installable File Systems</B>
<BR>
For file objects managed by OS/2 installable file systems, the following
rules apply:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Each element of a full path name residing on a disk
managed by an installable file system can consist of up to 255 characters.
File names can be up to 255 characters long (one of the characters must
be a terminating NULL, "\0"). Directory names can also be 255 characters
long, but the length of the complete path, including drive, directories,
and file name, cannot exceed 260 characters. For example, in the path name
"c:\XXX...XXX\YYY", "XXX...XXX" can include up to 255 characters. This is
referred to as long file names.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Names are not case sensitive.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->File name case as specified at create time is preserved.
This means that if the file "file.TXT" is created, DosFindFirst returns
"file.TXT".  File name case may be modified using DosMove.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Blanks immediately preceding a dot are significant.
This means that "FILE.TXT" and "FILE  .TXT" refer to different files.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Trailing blanks are truncated.  This means that "FILE.TXT
 " is the same as "FILE.TXT".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Blanks elsewhere in the name are significant.  This
means that "F I L E.TXT" is not the same as "FILE.TXT".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For compatibility reasons, trailing dots on component
names are discarded.  For Example, "\FILE.TXT...TEXT...\A..B...\C." becomes
"\FILE.TXT...TEXT\A..B\C". This processing includes semaphore, queue, pipe,
module, shared memory names, and device names.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The set of legal characters is expanded to include

<PRE>    +   =   ;   ,   [   ]
</PRE>

<P>
as well as all characters legal for the FAT file system.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If an installable file system uses a component separator
within a file name, it must be a dot (.). There are no restrictions on the
number of components which can be allowed within a file name, for example
"My.Programming.Reference.Part.One".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
