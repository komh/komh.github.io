<P>
If a general failure error is not returned, the physical device driver sets
the line characteristics as defined.  An OPEN request packet does not cause
the physical device driver to change the line characteristics from its previous
values.
<P>
If the WORD length is less than 8 bits, the appropriate high-order bits
for received data are set to 0 when placed in the receive queue and operated
on by the physical device driver (for example, XON/XOFF checking, null stripping).
 This only applies to data that is received after the command is operated
on by the physical device driver.  Data already in the physical device driver
receive queue is not affected in any way by a change in the WORD length.

<P>
If the WORD length is less than 8 bits, the physical device driver does
not automatically truncate control/transmit data that is passed by the application.
No error is reported by the device driver if transmit or control data given
to it has high-order bits of non-zero value.
<P>
For example, if the physical device driver is told that the WORD length
is 7 bits and the XOFF character is 80h, then a physical device driver that
has Automatic Transmit Flow Control enabled is not able to recognize the
XOFF character. If the error substitution character is set to 80h by the
application, with a WORD length of 7 currently active, the device driver
still places an 80h in the receive queue.  It is the responsibility of the
application to maintain consistency between the requested WORD length for
the COM device and the requests that the application makes of the physical
device driver.
