<H1>Enabling Extended Hardware Buffering</H1><!-- entering slot 1051 -->
<P>
In most transmit-only situations (for example, serial printers), there is
always a requirement for flow control (using Output Handshaking or Automatic
Transmit Flow Control). If the attached hardware can receive a significant
number of characters after the modem control (pacing) signal is changed,
then setting Extended Hardware Buffering to enabled (See IOCtl <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A>)
can be an acceptable way to significantly improve the transmit throughput
and the operating system performance. This allows the Extended Hardware
Buffering to yield maximum serial I/O performance while still providing
the required Output Handshaking or Automatic Transmit Flow Control protocols
required by the attached serial device. Testing with Extended Hardware Buffering
enabled must be performed at the attached device when the physical asynchronous
device driver is placed in this mode.
<P>
In many Receive and Transmit (half- or full-duplex) scenarios, disabling
Input Sensitivity Using DSR has no negative effects. Many communications
devices have switches that cause DSR to be constantly ON. Disabling Input
Sensitivity Using DSR significantly improves the ability of the serial port
hardware to handle receive data without receive hardware overrun errors.
Another possible approach is to set Extended Hardware Buffering enabled
by using IOCtl <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO
</A>or the OS/2 MODE command.
<P>
In some other Transmit and Receive scenarios, disabling Output Handshaking
Using CTS and DSR after a communications link has been established has no
adverse effects under normal operating conditions. Again,the achievable
performance benefits can be significant. Another possible approach is to
set Extended Hardware Buffering enabled by using IOCtl <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A>.

<P>
The potential negative effects of disabling a default control mode of the
physical device driver should be thoroughly understood. The potential performance
benefits, however, can far outweigh the added complexity of usage and any
other potential problems. Such problems can usually be resolved either by
reverting to the Automatic Protocol Override mode or by using IOCtl ASYNC_SETDCBINFO
to set Extended Hardware Buffering to disabled.
<P>
The per-character processing requirements must be addressed when deciding
whether to override one of the default protocols of the physical device
driver. Possible data integrity problems, such as receive overrun errors,
loss of data at the beginning or end of a communications session, or receipt
of invalid data on a noisy communications connection can occur. Such problems
must be considered before using the potential performance benefits associated
with Extended Hardware Buffering.
<P>
For ports operating at a given data-transfer rate, the system has less than
20% interrupt-driven device driver overhead when running with Extended Hardware
Buffering enabled (both transmit and receive FIFO buffering active), as
compared with running those ports on devices where Extended Hardware Buffering
is disabled.
<P>
Also of equal importance are the operational characteristics of the device
driver. By setting Extended Hardware Buffering enabled, the physical device
driver can transmit with the full 16-character FIFO buffer active (essentially
transmitting 16 characters at a time), and the Receive Data Available interrupts
can provide 4, 8, or 14 characters each to the physical device driver receive
queue. This is true no matter what device driver protocols are enabled.
Examples of scenarios where setting the FIFO Enabled mode of the physical
device driver might be acceptable are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the<!-- entering slot 1052 --> user does not care
if too many characters are transmitted after a modem connection is broken
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the printer or plotter connected to the system
does not lose data when it tells the system (with a modem control signal),
to stop transmitting, and the system continues to transmit a significant
number (up to 16) of characters<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the system is connected to a modem or another system
that is normally set up to always keep DSR ON<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the communications protocol with the remote device
does not require the system to respond on a character-by-character basis
to input data (for example, when the remote device sends data in blocks
and provides<I> error retry</I> capability on a block basis rather than
a per-character basis)
