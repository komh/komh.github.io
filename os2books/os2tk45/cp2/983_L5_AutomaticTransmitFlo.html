<H1>Automatic Transmit Flow Control (XON/XOFF)</H1><!-- entering slot 1011 -->
<P>
When the physical device driver is enabled for this mode of operation, it
stops sending data to the transmit hardware when an XOFF is received, and
resumes sending data to the transmit hardware when an XON is received.
<P>
If this mode is enabled, Error Alerts can be generated when the OS/2 Logging
Facility is enabled. If an external device sends an XOFF, but does not send
an XON, transmission of data is blocked because the device driver is waiting
for the XON to be received. If the XON is not received before the Write
Timeout period expires, an Error Alert is generated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL> First Level Open<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> There
is no effect on whether the physical device driver is enabled or disabled
for this mode of operation. The state of the physical device driver is reset
to show that it has not received an XOFF, so it can transmit (due to automatic
transmit flow control), if it is enabled for this mode of operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL> Automatic Override
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>When Automatic Transmit Flow Control is enabled,
the physical device driver responds to receiving the XOFF within a single
character time. That is, Automatic Protocol Override controls the Extended
Hardware Buffering capability so that only one character is buffered for
transmit at a time, and the device generates an interrupt for every character
received (Receive Trigger Level is set to 1).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
