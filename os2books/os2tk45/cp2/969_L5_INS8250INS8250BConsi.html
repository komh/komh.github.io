<H1>INS 8250, INS 8250-B Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 995 -->
<P>
The following hardware defects cannot be compensated for in the physical
device driver and can cause indeterminate function when used with the OS/2
physical ASYNC device driver:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Line Control Configurations<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> These devices are known
to transmit bad data when configured for 5 data bits and 1.5 stop bits.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Receive Character Overrun Errors<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> These
devices are known to occasionally drop received characters without posting
the RECEIVE_OVERRUN error flag. Undetected data loss can result from this
hardware deficiency. Application error-correction routines can be implemented
to ensure accurate data transmission when these devices are being used.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Spurious Characters at Power-On<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> These
devices can transmit a single random character at<I> power-on</I>. The connected
device must not be expecting valid data to be received until after the physical
device driver initialization routine has been run.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
