<H1>ASYNC_SETENHANCEDMODEPARMS (54h) - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1157 -->
<P>
This function is used to disable/enable the Enhanced mode operations or
to control the Receive/Transmit operations on a COM port with the Enhanced
UART or compatibles.  As a default, the physical device driver automatically
runs I/O operations in Enhanced mode, which is either DMA mode or Enhanced
FIFO mode.  In DMA mode, the data transfer from port to memory, or from
memory to port, can be done directly by the DMA chip, alleviating the CPU
operations and gaining maximum performance gain. A DMA-mode operation requires
a system resource called the<I> DMA channel</I>.
<P>
In Enhanced FIFO mode, the full capacity of Extended Hardware Buffering
is used automatically by the physical device driver.  In both operations,
the ABIOS function interfaces are used by the physical device driver to
maintain full compatibility with existing communication protocols. The Extended
Hardware Buffering Flags3 bit settings of <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO
</A>are ignored.
<P>
The user can turn the Enhanced mode<I> off</I> with this function, if desired.
 In this case, a COM port behaves as if it is a conventional serial device
with Extended Hardware Buffering capability.  The Extended Hardware Buffering
bit settings of Flags3 (Function 53h) are used to control the hardware FIFO
buffer.
<P>
If a general failure error is not returned, then the actions described below
are taken by the physical device driver.  If the Data Packet pointer is
not NULL, the IOCtl fails with the ERROR_GEN_FAILURE return code.
<P>
To maintain hardware compatibility, the application must call <A HREF="1236_L3_ASYNC_GETENHANCEDMOD.html">ASYNC_GETENHANCEDMODEPARMS</A>,
before the Function 54h is used.  This allows the Reserved bits to be set
correctly in a future release of the device driver.  By calling Function
74h first, the application can maintain the state of the physical device
driver for a mode that the application is not aware of.
<P>
<B>Note 1</B>
<P>
Enhanced Flags1.  Bits 0, 6, and 7 are only for querying the status of the
Enhanced mode (Function 74h) and are ignored when the user calls Function
54h.  Before setting bits 1-5, the user must call Function 74h to ensure
that a COM port supports the Enhanced mode and must check to see if bit
0 of the Enhanced Flags1 is set.  If bit 1 is set in Function 54h, the physical
device driver generates the general failure error return code.
<P>
As a default, when the Enhanced mode is supported, it is enabled and the
Enable Enhanced Mode bit is set.  The user can disable the Enhanced mode
by resetting this bit.  When Enhanced mode is disabled, the settings of
bits 2-5 are ignored and the enhanced FIFO/DMA capabilities of the hardware
are not exploited.  It is important that the user not disable the Enhanced
mode unless it is required to control the hardware FIFO buffer manually.
 In Enhanced mode, the physical device driver automatically controls the
hardware FIFO buffer for its maximum efficiency.  The advanced function
interfaces provided by the hardware allow a full compatibility with the
existing RS232-C communication protocols.
<P>
When the Disable DMA Receive Capability option is chosen, the device driver
does not try to use the DMA capability for receive operations. Instead,
the physical device driver runs receive operations in Enhanced FIFO mode
where the full FIFO capability and the enhanced ABIOS function interfaces
are automatically exploited.  The efficiency of the Enhanced FIFO-mode operations
is not as good as the DMA-mode operation, but is better than the Character-mode
operation.  This option allows the user to control the use of a limited
number of the available DMA channels in the system.  When the Enhanced mode
is disabled, the system runs in conventional mode and the advanced function
features provided by the hardware are not utilized.
<P>
The initial default system uses the Enable DMA Receive Capability option.
 In Enhanced mode, the physical device driver tries to use a DMA channel
at Open request time.  If there is no DMA channel available at that moment,
the operation defaults to Enhanced FIFO-mode operation. If the physical
device driver can successfully allocate a DMA channel, then the receive
operation operates in DMA mode.  When the Enhanced mode is disabled, no
attempt is made to allocate a DMA channel.
<P>
When the Dedicate a DMA Channel to Receive Operation option is requested,
the physical device driver tries to allocate a DMA channel as a dedicated
one for receive operations.  If a DMA channel cannot be allocated at the
time of request, the physical device driver returns the general failure
error.  If a DMA channel can be allocated successfully by Function 54h,
it is not deallocated until the user issues Function 54h again with<!-- entering slot 1158 --> another
option such as Enable DMA Receive Operation, Disable DMA Receive Operation,
or Disable Enhanced Mode.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the user requests to switch the state of DMA Receive Capability
while a receive operation is in process, there is a chance of loss of data.
 It is important that the user check the emptiness of the device driver
receive and transmit queues through <A HREF="1186_L3_ASYNC_GETINQUECOUNT6.html">ASYNC_GETINQUECOUNT</A>,
and <A HREF="1195_L3_ASYNC_GETOUTQUECOUNT.html">ASYNC_GETOUTQUECOUNT</A>.
 Before requesting the DMA-mode switch, the user must stop transmitting
and communication protocols must be employed to ensure the transmitting
system on the other end of the line has stopped transmitting.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
When the Disable DMA Transmit Capability option is chosen, the physical
device driver does not try to use the DMA capability for transmit operations.
 Instead, the physical device driver runs transmit operations in Enhanced
FIFO-mode, where the full FIFO capability and the enhanced ABIOS function
interfaces are automatically exploited. The efficiency of the Enhanced FIFO-mode
operations is not as good as the DMA-mode operation, but is better than
the Character-mode operation. This option allows the user to control the
use of a limited number of the available DMA channels in the system.  When
the Enhanced mode is disabled, the system runs in conventional mode and
the advanced function features provided by the hardware are not utilized.

<P>
The initial default system uses the Enable DMA Transmit Capability option.
 In Enhanced mode, with this option, the physical device driver tries to
use a DMA channel at each transmit request, and if there is no DMA channel
available at that moment, then the operation defaults to Enhanced FIFO-mode
operation.  If the physical device driver can successfully allocate a DMA
channel, then the transmit operation operates in DMA mode.  When the Enhanced
mode is disabled, no attempt is made to allocate a DMA channel.
<P>
When the Dedicate a DMA Channel to Transmit Operation option is requested,
the physical device driver tries to allocate a DMA channel as a dedicated
one for transmit operation.  If a DMA channel cannot be allocated at the
time of request, the physical device driver returns the general failure
error.  If a DMA channel can be allocated successfully by Function 54h,
it is not deallocated until the user issues Function 54h again with another
option such as Enable DMA Transmit Operation, Disable DMA Transmit Operation,
or Disable Enhanced Mode.
