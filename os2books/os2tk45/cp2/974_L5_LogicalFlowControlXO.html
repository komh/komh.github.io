<P>
The application can attempt to manually control the flow of data by using
the following IOCtls:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Transmit Immediate (<A HREF="1051_L3_ASYNC_TRANSMITIMM44h.html">ASYNC_TRANSMITIMM</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Stop Transmit Behave as if XOFF Received (<A HREF="1076_L3_ASYNC_STOPTRANSMIT47.html">ASYNC_STOPTRANSMIT</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Start Transmit Behave as if XON Received (<A HREF="1083_L3_ASYNC_STARTTRANSMIT4.html">ASYNC_STARTTRANSMIT</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The physical device driver automatically controls the flow of transmitted
data based upon the reception of XON/XOFF characters. This is referred to
as Automatic Transmit Flow Control (XON/XOFF). The physical device driver
also attempts to control the flow of data that is received by automatically
transmitting XON/XOFF characters to the system it is communicating with,
based on the amount of space left in the receive queue. This is referred
to as Automatic Receive Flow Control (XON/XOFF).
