<H1>About Exception Management</H1><!-- entering slot 828 -->
<P>
A multitasking operating system must manage applications carefully. A serious
error (such as an attempt to access protected memory) occurring in one application
cannot be permitted to damage any other application in the system. To manage
errors that might damage other applications, OS/2 defines a class of error
conditions called exceptions and defines default actions for those errors.

<P>
When an exception occurs, the default action taken by OS/2 is usually to
terminate the application causing the exception (unless the application
has registered its own exception handling routines). In some cases, when
the exception can safely be ignored, execution is allowed to continue.
<P>
Rather than having OS/2 default action occur, an application can register
its own<I> exception handlers</I> routines. An exception handler routine
could be written to correct certain error conditions-when these error conditions
occur, the thread's exception handler gets the exception, corrects the condition,
and the thread continues executing rather than being terminated immediately
by OS/2. OS/2's default action is taken if there are no user-defined exception
handling routines or if all user-defined routines return without handling
the exception.
<P>
An application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C3 4E --> DosSetExceptionHandler
</A>to register an exception handling routine.<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C3 4E --> DosSetExceptionHandler
</A>takes a pointer to an <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>data structure as its only argument. The first field in this data structure
is a pointer to the previous exception handler in the chain. This field
is maintained by OS/2 and must never be modified by an application. The
second field is a pointer to the exception handling routine that will be
registered by OS/2.
<P>
A single exception handler can be used to handle all the exceptions that
you choose to handle. It is not necessary to have a separate exception handler
for each exception.
<P>
Once an exception handling routine is registered, the system will notify
it when an exception occurs. OS/2 sends synchronous exceptions only to the
thread causing the exception. An application must register an exception
handler for each thread that is handling exceptions. When OS/2 terminates
an application, however, a process-termination exception is sent to all
threads used by the application to be terminated. When the user presses
Ctrl+Break, an asynchronous signal exception is sent only to Thread 1, the
main thread, of the executing process.
<P>
The exception handling routine is passed the following four parameters that
provide exception-specific information:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD</A><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Describes
the exception and its parameters. The first field of this data structure
contains the number of the exception that occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A><!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>The <A HREF="181_L2_EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIO.html">EXCEPTIONREGISTRATIONRECORD
</A>data structure used to initially register the exception handler. This
is a microprocessor-specific value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ContextRecord
<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL>Describes the machine state at the time the exception
occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DispatcherContext<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Contains
state information on nested exception and collided unwinds. This information
must not be modified by the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Details of the parameters and data structures can be found in <A HREF="823_L2_ExceptionHandlerInte.html">Exception
Handler Interface</A>.
<P>
OS/2 places the exception handlers for each thread in an<I> exception handler
chain</I>. Registering an exception handler adds it to the head of the chain.

<P>
When an application registers an exception handler, the exception handler
is added to the head of the chain. If the application calls a routine in
a dynamic link library (DLL), the DLL might register an exception handler
in case there is an exception while its code is executing; the DLL deregisters
the exception handler before returning control to the application. The DLL's
exception handler would be ahead of the application's exception handler
in the chain.
<P>
Exception handlers in the chain are notified of an exception in Last-In-First-Out
(LIFO) order. Thus, if an exception occurs while your thread is executing,
the exception handler for your thread is notified of the exception first.
If your exception handler chooses to handle the exception, the earlier exception
handlers in the chain never see the exception. If your exception handler
chooses not to handle the exception, it is passed along to the next earlier
exception handler in the chain. If no exception handler in the chain chooses
to handle the exception, OS/2 takes the default action for the exception.

<P>
If an exception happens while DLL code is executing, and if the DLL's exception
handler chooses to handle the exception, your application's exception handlers
will never be aware it.
