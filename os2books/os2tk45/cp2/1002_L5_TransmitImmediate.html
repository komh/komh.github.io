<P>
The device driver can be told to transmit a byte immediately, bypassing
the normal file system Write requests (bypassing the data to be transmitted
in the transmit queue). Only one character at a time can be waiting to be
transmitted<I> immediately</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Considerations<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> A CLOSE request packet, when after
processing this close request the port is not open any more (from another
open without a close), causes the device driver to attempt to transmit the
character waiting to be transmitted immediately. If the physical device
driver cannot transmit the character waiting to be transmitted immediately
(see IOCtl <A HREF="1051_L3_ASYNC_TRANSMITIMM44h.html">ASYNC_TRANSMITIMM</A>),
it does not try to transmit the character and proceeds with the close processing.
