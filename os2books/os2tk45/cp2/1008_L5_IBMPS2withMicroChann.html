<H1>IBM PS/2 (with Micro Channel) Considerations for COM1-4</H1><!-- entering slot 1036 -->
<P>
The IBM PS/2 ASYNC device driver has device names COM1, COM2, COM3, and
COM4 in its device driver header. Device name COM1 corresponds to the first
LID in the ABIOS common data area with the ASYNC Device ID. Device name
COM2 corresponds to the second LID. Device name COM3 corresponds to the
third LID. Device name COM4 corresponds to the fourth LID in the ABIOS common
data area with the ASYNC Device ID.
<P>
The Advanced BIOS architecture ensures that the ordering in the ROM BIOS
40: data area matches the ordering of the LIDs in the common data area.
Compatibility BIOS supports up to four ASYNC devices on the IBM PS/2 system,
and the physical device driver assumes that the order of the Logical IDs
matches the order of the addresses of these devices in the ROM BIOS 40:
data area. Additional ASYNC devices can be supported by additional device
drivers.
<P>
The mapping of the ASYNC Logical ID ordering to COM<I>n</I> must be consistent
across all device drivers that support the ASYNC hardware in the IBM PS/2
hardware environment.
