<P>
The OS/2<I> Boot Manager</I> enables different operating systems to co-reside
on the same computer. The user selects the operating system to boot when
the computer is turned on. For example, DOS, AIX, and the OS/2 operating
system can co-reside on the same machine. There can also be a previous version
of the OS/2 operating system on the machine co-existing with the current
version of the operating system.
<P>
Each operating system has its own partition and each partition is managed
by the appropriate file system for the operating system that owns it. A
DOS partition has a FAT file system. An OS/2 partition can have either a
FAT file system or HPFS. An AIX partition will use the AIX file system to
manage its partition.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> FAT partitions that follow HPFS partitions on the same physical
disk cannot be accessed when using DOS because DOS stops at the first partition
it does not recognize.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
