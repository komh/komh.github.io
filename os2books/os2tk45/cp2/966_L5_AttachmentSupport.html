<P>
The ASYNC physical device driver does not provide any support for devices
attached to the RS232-C port. The physical device driver provides enabling
support for the RS232-C interface itself. Application programs, subsystems,
and systems programs provide the support needed to use devices attached
to the RS232-C port.
<P>
The ability to support a device can be determined by understanding the level
of RS232-C interface enabling support the physical device driver provides,
along with the characteristics of the attachment hardware in question and
the required functions to be supported.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system provides a mechanism where one or more additional
drivers can be installed to support specific COM ports. This feature might
be required for the following reasons:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To allow an application program to support a special
device not adequately supportable with this ASYNC device driver<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To allow additional COM ports (besides COM1-4 on IBM
PS/2) to be supported<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To enhance the level of device driver function for
a given COM port (This might be required for certain subsystem support.)
