<H1>Transforming File Names Using Metacharacters</H1><!-- entering slot 960 -->
<P>
File system functions that an application uses to copy, rename or move file
objects do not support the use of global characters. For example, a user
can perform a global copy of all files with the extension .EXE by entering
the following on the command line:
<PRE>    copy *.exe
</PRE>

<P>
An application, however, cannot perform a similar global copy operation
by making a single call to DosCopy or DosMove. These functions operate on
a single, specific file object.
<P>
DosEditName, however, provides applications with the ability to transform
an element of a full path name into another name, using an editing string
that contains global characters. For example, for an application to copy
all files with an extension of .SRC to files with an extension of .SAM,
the application would:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Search for all files with the .SRC extension
by using DosFindFirst and DosFindNext,<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Transform the file names by using DosEditName
with an editing string of "*.SAM",<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Copy the files with the new extension with DosCopy.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
