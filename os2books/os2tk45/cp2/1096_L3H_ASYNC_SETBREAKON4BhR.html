<P>
If a general failure error is not returned, the physical device driver generates
the break signal immediately.  It is not considered an error if the physical
device driver is already generating a break signal.  The device driver does
not wait for the transmit hardware to become empty.  Note that more data
is not given to the transmit hardware until the break is turned<I> off</I>.
 The break signal is always transmitted, regardless of whether or not the
physical device driver is transmitting characters for other reasons.
