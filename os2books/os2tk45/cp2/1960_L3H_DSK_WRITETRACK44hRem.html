This function is used to perform a write of sectors on the media and to
perform the operations on the device that is specified in this request.
The track table passed in on the call is used to determine the sector number,
which is passed to the disk controller for the operation. In cases where
the sectors are oddly numbered or are non-consecutive, this request breaks
into<I> n</I> single sector operations and writes one sector at a time.
This DosDevIOCtls is typically used when performing I/O outside of the normal
file system data area on the media.
