<P>
Programs that recognize long file names must indicate this by including
the NEWFILES statement in their module definition file. This statement directs
the linker to set a bit in the executable file header. It indicates that
the module supports long file names. This bit is meaningless in a DOS Session
and on versions of the OS/2 operating system prior to Version 1.2. Programs
written for OS/2 Version 1.2 (and all later versions) installable file systems
should set this bit. Bound programs that have this bit set can see files
with long file names in OS/2 mode, but only files with 8.3 file name format
in DOS Sessions.
<P>
This bit has meaning when attached to program modules, not when attached
to DLLs. Whether the program recognizes long file names format is entirely
dependent on the value of its NEWFILES bit and the effect of the bit extends
into any calls to DLLs. In order to be compatible with all OS/2 file systems,
dynamic link libraries must not create internal temporary files or directories
that do not comply with 8.3 file naming conventions. In addition, dynamic
link libraries cannot return long file names to an application. (The caller
might be running on a file system that only supports 8.3 file names and
use the returned name to create a file.)
<P>
OS/2 applications which do not recognize long file names can run with some
restrictions. For these programs, long names (including device names) are
filtered according to the following rules:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any name not representable in the 8.3 file name format
is not returned from DosFindFirst or DosFindNext. This is because the application's
buffers are unlikely to be large enough to handle longer names.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any long file name passed to the file system functions
listed below are rejected in exactly the same way as under previous versions
of the OS/2 operating system. It is not acceptable to create and manipulate
a name that you cannot find.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
DosOpen<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

DosDelete<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->

DosQueryFSAttach<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
DosFSAttach<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
DosCopy<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
DosSearchPath<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Long
file names can be passed to DosSetCurrentDir and DosQueryCurrrentDir so
that all programs can use all directories.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Long
names used with non-file system functions (for example, DosCreateSem) are
not filtered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For files located on file devices managed by the OS/2 FAT file system, long
file names are handled differently in OS/2 mode than in DOS mode. In OS/2
mode, the long file name is considered an error. In DOS mode, the name is
truncated and is not an error. The DOS mode treatment of file name formats
provides compatibility with the PC-DOS environment for applications originally
written for PC-DOS. However, if you are writing a family application to
run under both the OS/2 operating system and the PC-DOS environment, your
application must allow for this difference in operating environments.
<P>
Because long file names can be input to applications through program command
lines, dialog boxes, or function calls, applications must provide their
users with rules for how to enter file names. <A HREF="938_L2_FileNamesinUserInput.html">File
Names in User Input</A> provides some general guidelines in this matter,
that are applicable to both long file names and 8.3 file names.
