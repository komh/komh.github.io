<H1>Raising Exceptions</H1><!-- entering slot 834 -->
<P>
Asynchronous exceptions that have been deferred in a must-complete section
are dispatched automatically by the system when the thread exits the must-complete
section. However, a synchronous exception that has been deferred must be
raised by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 FC --> DosRaiseException</A>.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 -->DosRaiseException</A> can also be
used to simulate either an asynchronous or synchronous exception. For example,
a floating point emulator (a program that emulates a numeric coprocessor)
can use this function to simulate an NPX exception.
<P>
Raising a software exception captures the machine state of the current thread
in a ContextRecord data structure. The ExceptionAddress field of <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>is set to the return address of the caller, as are the corresponding
fields of the ContextRecord data structure. The system then calls each exception
handler on the list, passing each a pointer to <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>and the created ContextRecord data structures. In the case of a continuable
exception for which XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION is returned,<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 --> DosRaiseException
</A>restores the potentially modified context back into the machine before
returning. Note that control cannot return to the caller of<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 --> DosRaiseException
</A>if the instruction pointer in ContextRecord has been modified.
<P>
The caller of<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 --> DosRaiseException</A> can
set the EH_NONCONTINUABLE bit in the flags field of the <A HREF="184_L2_EXCEPTIONREPORTRECOR.html">EXCEPTIONREPORTRECORD
</A>data structure. By doing so, the caller guarantees that it is never
returned to after the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 FC --> DosRaiseException</A>.
Note that once set, the EH_NONCONTINUABLE bit cannot be modified by any
exception handler. The system will enforce this.
<P>
Following are some possible scenarios that might occur after a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 --> DosRaiseException
</A>has been made:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If one of the exception handlers returns from a continuable
exception with a status of XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION,<A><!-- external link: 1D D6 C3 40 --> DosRaiseException
</A>returns NO_ERROR to the caller, and the thread resumes execution.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If one of the exception handlers returns from a noncontinuable
exception with a status of XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION, the process is terminated,
because it is illegal to return XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION from a noncontinuable
exception.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If none of the exception handlers in the thread's
chain of handlers returns with a status of XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION, then
the action taken depends on the exception number:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If the exception number indicates a user-assigned
exception or an unassigned system exception, the process is terminated.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If the exception number is assigned to a system exception,
and CS:EIP points to 32-bit code, no 16-bit handlers are called and the
system default action is taken. Depending on which system exception has
been raised, the default action is either to terminate the process, or to
continue execution of the thread with NO_ERROR returned to the caller.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If the exception number is assigned to a system exception
that maps to a 16-bit exception and CS:EIP points to 16-bit code, a 16-bit
exception handler is called, if one is registered. Otherwise OS/2 takes
the default action.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
