<P>
This function is supported by the screen device driver.  A 32-bit physical
address and 16-bit length are passed to the physical device driver. The
physical device driver returns an LDT selector for that area of memory.

<P>
Read/Write access is granted to any data areas completely contained in the
range of addresses from A0000 to BFFFF.  Read-Only access is granted for
all other data areas completely contained in the range of addresses from
00000 to FFFFF.  Requests for any other data areas result in a return code
of ERROR_I24_INVALID_PARAMETER.
<P>
If the PhysToUVirt Device helper service returns a nonzero offset along
with the requested selector, the selector is deallocated and ERROR_I24_INVALID_PARAMETER
is returned.  In this case, <A HREF="1281_L3_SCR_ALLOCLDTOFF75hAl.html">SCR_ALLOCLDTOFF
</A>should be used.
