<P>
Returns audio status and the starting and ending locations of the last playback
or the next resume position.
<P>
If a Stop Audio function (Category 81h, Function 51h) was issued to stop
playing, the paused bit is set to 1; the starting location is where the
playback was stopped, and the ending location should be the ending location
that was specified in the last Play Audio command.  If there was no preceding
Play Audio or Stop Audio command, the paused bit should be set to 0, and
the starting and ending locations should be the CD Redbook equivalents of
those specified in the last Play Audio command.
<P>
If a Play Audio command has been completed (without being stopped), the
paused bit should be set to 0, and the starting and ending locations should
be as specified in the Play Audio command.  If a Resume Audio function has
been completed, the paused bit should be set to 0, and the starting and
ending locations should be as they were at the beginning of the Resume Audio
command.
