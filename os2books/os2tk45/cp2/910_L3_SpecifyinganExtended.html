<H1>Specifying an Extended LIBPATH</H1><!-- entering slot 931 -->
<P>
The LIBPATH, which is set in CONFIG.SYS, specifies a search path which OS/2
uses when searching for dynamic link libraries (DLLs). The LIBPATH is set
during system startup and cannot be changed dynamically.
<P>
OS/2 provides the capability of specifying extensions to the LIBPATH. An
<I>Extended LIBPATH</I> is a path which is searched in conjunction with
the system LIBPATH, but which can be changed dynamically, either by the
user from the command line, or by an application.
<P>
There are two Extended LIBPATHs:<I> BeginLIBPATH</I>, which is searched
before the system LIBPATH, and<I> EndLIBPATH</I>, which is searched after
the system LIBPATH.
<P>
Extended LIBPATHs are ASCIIZ strings which are formatted in the same manner
as the system LIBPATH, that is, they contains a list of subdirectory paths
separated by semicolons. The maximum size for each Extended LIBPATH is 1024
characters.
<P>
Applications can use<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C3 32 --> DosSetExtLIBPATH
</A>to set the Extended LIBPATHs.  Likewise, they can use<A><!-- external link: 1D C0 C3 31 --> DosQueryExtLIBPATH
</A>to query the value of either of the Extended LIBPATHs. A flag parameter
for the function specifies whether the BeginLIBPATH or the EndLIBPATH is
being set or queried. The flag allows two values: BEGIN_LIBPATH (1) which
will set or query BeginLIBPATH, or END_LIBPATH (2) which will set or query
EndLIBPATH.
<P>
You can call<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C3 32 --> DosSetExtLIBPATH</A> as
often as you want. The new Extended LIBPATH that you pass in will replace
the current Extended LIBPATH.
<P>
You can specify the current Extended LIBPATH as part of the argument by
using the<B> %</B> symbol before and after the Extended LIBPATH variable
name, that is, as<I> %BeginLIBPATH%</I> or<I> %EndLIBPATH%</I>. For example,
suppose you set BeginLIBPATH to "D:\MYDLLS", then later you want to add
"D:\TOMSDLLS" before the existing BeginLIBPATH, and "D:\JOESDLLS" after
the existing BeginLIBPATH (that is, you want to change BeginLIBPATH to "D:\TOMSDLLS;D:\MYDLLS;D:\JOESDLLS").
You could accomplish this by using "D:\TOMSDLLS;%BeginLIBPATH%;D:\JOESDLLS"
as the argument for<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C3 FC --> DosSetExtLIBPATH</A>.

<P>
The string argument can be up to 1024 characters long. However, if the resulting
Extended LIBPATH is longer than 1024 characters, the function will return
an error.
