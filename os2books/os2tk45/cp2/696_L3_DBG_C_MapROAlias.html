</UL>
<P>
An alias to the debuggee's memory region of the requested length is mapped
into the debugger's memory space. This region is reserved for use as an
alias region until it is unmapped.
<P>
The access rights for the alias area are determined by the command number.
The DBG_C_MapROAlias command maps a read-only alias region, while the <A HREF="697_L3_DBG_C_MapRWAlias.html">DBG_C_MapRWAlias
</A>command maps a read-write alias region.
<P>
For read-write aliases, if the region is shared and read-only in the debuggee's
context, a private copy of the aliased pages will be created in the debuggee's
context, and dynamic RAS tracepoints will be removed from that region. This
prevents debugging from affecting other areas of the system, while allowing
access to shared memory areas, and proper disassembly of regions where dynamic
RAS tracepoints are in use.
<P>
Because the read-write aliases may convert objects to private, using up
system resources, it is recommended that read-only aliases be used when
simply perusing memory.  See the following<B> Restrictions</B> regarding
read-only aliases on the 80386 processor.
<P>
Because the entire aliased region may map both valid and invalid regions
of memory, debuggers should issue<A><!-- external link: 1D C6 C3 51 --> DosQueryMem
</A>just before accessing the alias region to determine if the region is
valid. Debuggers should not access this region while the debuggee is executing,
as portions of this region may become invalid without notifying the debugger.
It is possible that no valid pages will exist in the alias region.
<P>
When the debuggee frees an aliased object, or shrinks the underlying object
such that the alias would span a region outside the resultant object, an
alias-free notification is returned to the debugger. This notification will
be returned before the alias is invalidated. See <A HREF="710_L2_DosDebugNotification.html">DosDebug
Notifications</A> for details.
<P>
These commands may be performed while the debuggee is executing code via
a <A HREF="686_L3_DBG_C_Go.html">DBG_C_Go</A> command.
<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
Because debuggers can execute code at ring 2, and the read-only bit in the
page tables entries is effective only at ring 3, the read-only aliases cannot
be supported. When the read-only bit becomes effective at all rings, as
is expected on later processors, the read-only aliases will again be supported.

<P>
Most memory management calls may not be used on these aliases.<A><!-- external link: 1D C6 C3 51 --> DosQueryMem
</A>is permitted, but for interrogation only.
<P>
The passed starting addresses must be aligned on a page boundary, and the
length of the aliased region must be a multiple of the page size. This restriction
is due to the underlying hardware.
<P>
Aliased regions must be completely contained within a single debuggee memory
object.
<P>
No interface is available for moving an alias to point to another section
of debuggee memory. To move an alias, the debugger must free an existing
alias, and then map a new alias to the desired region.
<P>
Aliases will only be permitted to the user space memory region of the debuggee.
No aliases will be provided to system space.
<P>
The alias region will only be provided at the linear level. No debugger
Local Descriptor Table (<!-- entering slot 708 --> LTD) selector will be
available to access the alias region.
