<P>
OS/2 allows more than one file system on a single storage device. If the
device can have more than one partition (or volume), each partition can
be initialized as an OS/2 partition and given a valid OS/2 file system.
For each volume, OS/2 determines the type of file system the first time
the volume is accessed by a function or when the medium in the drive changes.
After that, OS/2 manages all input and output to that volume by using the
corresponding dynamic link library.
<P>
OS/2 uses the volume label and serial number to ensure that the medium in
the drive does not change while there are outstanding requests for input
and output. Each volume has a volume label and a 32-bit volume serial number,
stored in a reserved location in logical sector 0 at the time of formatting.
If the volume label and serial number do not match, OS/2 signals the critical
error handler to prompt the user to insert the volume that has the specified
serial number and label. OS/2 maintains the connection between the medium
and the volume label and serial number until all open files on the volume
are closed and all search references and cache buffer references are removed.
The system redetermines the type of file system and the volume label and
serial number only when the medium changes.

If the write verification switch is on, each time data is written to the
disk, the data is verified to ensure it has been recorded correctly. These
functions are provided for recording critical data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
