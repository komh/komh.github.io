<H1>ASYNC_STOPTRANSMIT (47h) - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1110 -->
<P>
If a<I> general failure</I> error is not returned by the physical device
driver, this function causes data transmission to be stopped by preventing
the physical device driver from sending additional data to the transmit
hardware.
<P>
If Automatic Transmit Flow Control is enabled, this request causes the physical
device driver to behave as if it had received the XOFF character.  Transmission
can be resumed when an XON is received by the physical device driver after
a <A HREF="1083_L3_ASYNC_STARTTRANSMIT4.html">ASYNC_STARTTRANSMIT</A> request
is received, or when the physical device driver is told to disable Automatic
Transmit Flow Control (if it was enabled).
<P>
If Automatic Transmit Flow Control is disabled, then the Function 48h request
is required for transmission to be resumed.  If, after this request is received,
the physical device driver is told to enable Automatic Transmit Flow Control,
then transmission is still disabled, but can be re-enabled.  See Note 2
of <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A>.
<P>
See <A HREF="1154_L3_ASYNC_GETCOMMSTATUS6.html">ASYNC_GETCOMMSTATUS</A> for
other reasons why transmission might be disabled.
