<H1>File Names in User Input</H1><!-- entering slot 961 -->
<P>
Users often supply file names as part of an application's command line or
in response to a prompt from the application. Traditionally, users have
been able to supply more than one file name by separating the names with
certain characters, such as a blank space. In some file systems, however,
traditional separators are valid file name characters. This means additional
conventions are required to ensure that an application processes all characters
in a name.
<P>
When an application processes arguments (including file names) from its
command line, the operating system treats the double quotation mark (")
and the caret (^) as quotation characters. All characters between the opening
and closing double quotation marks are processed as a single argument. The
caret is used to quote characters that would otherwise have some special
property. The character immediately following the caret is treated as a
normal character; any special characteristics that the character has are
to be ignored. For example, the greater-than symbol (&gt;) normally causes
a program's output to be redirected to a file or device. Typing "^&gt;"
causes the "&gt;" to be included in the command line passed to the application.
In both cases, the operating system discards the quotation characters and
does not treat them as part of the final argument.
<P>
When a Presentation Manager*(PM) application processes two or more file
names from a dialog box or other prompt, it expects the user to enter each
file name on a new line. Therefore, a PM application would use a multiple-line
entry field to prompt for multiple file names. This often makes the use
of quotation characters unnecessary.
<P>
When an application is started, the operating system constructs a command
line for the application. If the command line includes file names, the operating
system places a space character between names and marks the end of the list
with two NULL characters. Applications that start other applications by
using DosExecPgm can also pass arguments by using this convention or by
using quotation characters. In practice, most applications receive a command
line as a single, NULL-terminated string. Therefore, applications that use
DosExecPgm should prepare command lines as a single string, and enclose
any file names in quotation marks.
