<H1>Category and Function Codes</H1><!-- entering slot 790 -->
<P>
Each IOCtl function has a category and a function code. The category defines
the type of device to be accessed. OS/2 has several predefined categories.
In general, all codes in the range 0x0000 through 0x007F are reserved for
predefined categories. A device driver can use additional categories, but
they must be explicitly defined by the device and be in the range 0x0080
through 0x00FF.
<P>
In each category, a function code defines the action to carry out, such
as reading from or writing to the device and retrieving or setting the device
modes. The number and meaning of each function code depend on the device
driver and the specified category.
