<H1>High Performance File System</H1><!-- entering slot 968 -->
<P>
The High Performance File System (HPFS) is an installable file system. It
is a hierarchical system and supports multiple directories. In many cases,
accessing files under HPFS is faster than accessing similar files under
the FAT file system. During installation of the OS/2 operating system, users
can install the HPFS on the hard disk they use to start their computer.

<P>
Features of HPFS include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
File names under HPFS can contain 255 characters (one must be the terminating
NULL, "\0") and can contain characters that are not valid for the FAT file
system-for example, spaces. Each element of a path name residing on an HPFS
disk can also have up to 255 characters. The total path including drive,
directories, and file name cannot exceed 260 characters (259 with the terminating
NULL). For more information on long file name support by installable file
systems see <A HREF="932_L3_LongFileNames.html">Long File Names</A>.
<P>
HPFS provides extremely fast access to very large disk volumes. HPFS uses
a memory cache divided into blocks of 2KB. Data that is read from and written
to the disk is transferred through this cache. Frequently-used data will
often be found in the cache, thereby saving the time that a disk-read operation
would require. When a user request specifies data that is not present in
the cache, HPFS selects the least-recently used discardable block and then
fills the block with the requested data.
<P>
When a write-data request is received, it usually is not necessary that
the data be immediately written to the disk. HPFS will copy such data into
the block cache without actually performing the disk-write operation. When
the data is in the cache, it is written to disk as a background activity
(referred to as lazy writing) which enables the typical user-write operation
to occur much faster than in file systems where all write operations are
synchronous.

When the data in a cache block exceeds the specified time the block is queued
for writing to the disk. This reduces the amount of data lost due to inopportune
system shutdowns.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DiskIdle and BufferIdle
<P>
When no user I/O request (non-lazy-write) has been made for<I> DiskIdle
</I>number of milliseconds, all cache blocks (in oldest-first order) that
have not been touched for<I> BufferIdle</I> number of milliseconds are queued
for writing to disk. This enables HPFS to write out user data during times
of relative disk inactivity and to reduce the need for<!-- entering slot 969 --> rewriting
heavily used cached blocks.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
STARTLW.DLL contains the code that starts the lazy-write thread.
