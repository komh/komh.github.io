<B>Returns</B>
<P>
The RangeStep notification is usually returned, but any Debug notification
may be returned. See <A HREF="710_L2_DosDebugNotification.html">DosDebug
Notifications</A> for more information.
<P>
This command allows a debugger to specify a range of addresses (bounded
by the linear addresses in the Value and Addr fields) through which a debuggee
thread should single-step until one of the following conditions occurs:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The debuggee thread's linear EIP (instruction pointer)
is outside the range.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The linear
EIPs of consecutive debuggee threads are the same.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Some other notification occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When the DBG_C_RangeStep command returns, the register set is automatically
updated to reflect the thread that detected the event.
<P>
Callgates that result in a privilege level transition to ring 0 will appear
to range-step as a single instruction, with the range-step continuing after
the function completes. This hides ring 0 execution from debuggers.
<P>
Attempting to range-step a thread that is frozen results in an error.
<P>
<B>Restrictions</B>
<P>
To accomplish callgate single-stepping, the single-step must be simulated
because the flags (specifically, the TF bit) are not stored in the ring
0 callgate stack frame. Because of this, a range-step that results in leaving
a ring 0 callgate will sometimes not execute any user-space code. The following
range-step should function normally.
<P>
Range-stepping some REP instructions may not work correctly due to errors
in the 80386 processor.
