There are two types of linking:<I> static</I> and<I> dynamic</I>.  Static
linking enables a program's code and data to be contained in a single executable
file, enabling the system to load it all into memory at once.  Dynamic linking
permits several applications to use a single copy of an executable module,
since the executable module is completely separate from the applications
that use it.
<P>
The advantages of dynamic linking are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
OS/2 provides two types of dynamic linking:<I> load-time</I> and<I> run-time</I>.
 In load-time dynamic linking, an application is linked with a library file
that contains a record that describes where the routine can be found instead
of a file that contains the code for the routine.  The DLL can be loaded
as soon as a process accesses the DLL or when needed.  In run-time dynamic
linking, the EXE for an application does not contain a record describing
where the external routines can be found.  Instead, the application explicitly
tells OS/2 when to load and free the dynamic link module.
<P>
DLL data can be shared or not shared by all processes that use it.
