<H1>Handling Signal Exceptions</H1><!-- entering slot 832 -->
<P>
To handle signal exceptions, a process must first call<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C3 30 --> DosSetExceptionHandler
</A>to register a handler for the exceptions. Next, the process must call
<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 FC -->DosSetSignalExceptionFocus</A>, with
the<I> Flag</I> parameter set to ON, in order to receive signal exceptions.

<P>
After a process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 FC --> DosSetSignalExceptionFocus</A>,
it remains the signal focus for its screen group until it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 32 --> DosSetSignalExceptionFocus
</A>again with the<I> Flag</I> parameter set to OFF, or until another process
in the screen group makes a call to the same function with<I> Flag</I> set
to ON.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 32 --> DosSetSignalExceptionFocus
</A>with<I> Flag</I> set to ON increments a counter in the per-task data
area of the process. Each call with<I> Flag</I> set to OFF decrements the
counter. When a signal exception occurs, the system checks to see whether
the value of the counter is greater than 0. If it is, the signal is sent.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 32 -->DosSetSignalExceptionFocus</A> returns
ERROR_NESTED_TOO_DEEP if the value of the counter exceeds 65535. If a thread
tries to turn off the signal focus when the value of the counter is 0, ERROR_ALREADY_RESET
is returned.
<P>
All 32-bit exception handlers that are attached to thread 1 of the process
will be given an opportunity to handle the signal. If no 32-bit exception
handler returns XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION in response to the signal, and if
a 16-bit exception handler is registered, then the 16-bit handler for the
signal will be executed. If none exists, then the process will be terminated.

<P>
In order to continue receiving signals, the process must either return XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION
from a 32-bit exception handler, or it must call the 16-bit DosSetSigHandler
function, specifying SIG_ACKNOWLEDGE as the value of the<I> Action</I> parameter
to acknowledge the signal, or it must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 FC --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException</A>.

<P>
The typematic facility of the keyboard could cause a Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break
signal exception to repeat. For this reason, the system holds these exceptions
until an exception handler returns XCPT_CONTINUE_EXECUTION, or calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 5C C3 FC --> DosAcknowledgeSignalException</A>.
However, only one signal exception is actually held; they are not queued
by the system.
<P>
See <A HREF="818_L3_MustCompleteSections.html">Must-Complete Sections</A> for
information about how a process can defer the handling of signal exceptions.
