<H1>Automatic Receive Flow Control (XON/XOFF)</H1><!-- entering slot 1010 -->
<P>
When the physical device driver is enabled for this mode of operation, it
transmits an XOFF when its receive queue gets close to full, and an XON
when its receive queue is about half full.
<P>
The normal mode of Automatic Receive Flow Control causes the ASYNC device
driver to stop transmitting all data after it sends an XOFF character until
its receive queue lowers to about half full, when it sends the XON character.
This behavior is suitable for most devices, but reduces transmit throughput
significantly in Full-Duplex (Transmit and Receive) communications scenarios.
By setting the Full-Duplex mode of Automatic Receive Flow Control, the physical
ASYNC device driver continues to send application data after it sends the
XOFF character. See IOCtl <A HREF="1098_L3_ASYNC_SETDCBINFO53hS.html">ASYNC_SETDCBINFO</A>.

Initial Value<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->

disabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> First Level Open<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> There
is no effect on whether the physical device driver is enabled or disabled
for this mode of operation. The state of the physical device driver is reset
to show that the last flow control character automatically transmitted was
an XON, if it is enabled for this mode of operation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Close
Considerations<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> If the last character automatically
transmitted by the physical device driver was an XOFF and a CLOSE request
packet is received, the physical device driver automatically transmits an
XON, if possible. After processing this close request, the port is not open
any more from another open without a close.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Mode
Utility<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Always disables Automatic Receive Flow Control.
