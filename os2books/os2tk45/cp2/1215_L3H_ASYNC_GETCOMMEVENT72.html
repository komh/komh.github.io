<B>COM Event WORD</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The appropriate bits in the
COM Event WORD are set by the device driver when the events described below
occur.  The COM Event WORD is not cleared unless this function is performed
by the physical device driver or an OPEN request packet is received by the
physical device driver and the COM device is not already open.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Bit 0<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when any character is read from the COM
device receive hardware and placed in the receive queue.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit
1<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set whenever the serial port controller generates
a Receive Timeout Interrupt during a Receive request.  This bit is always
zero when the serial port controller does not support Extended Hardware
Buffering.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit 2<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when
the last character in the physical device driver transmit queue is sent
to the COM device transmit hardware.  Data in any outstanding Write requests
still might need to be sent.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit 3<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set
when the Clear To Send (CTS) signal changes state.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit
4<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal changes
state.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit 5<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when the
Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal changes state.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit
6<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when a break is detected.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit
7<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set when a parity, framing, or receive hardware
(or receive queue) overrun error occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> Bit 8<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Set
when trailing edge of Ring Indicator is detected.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
