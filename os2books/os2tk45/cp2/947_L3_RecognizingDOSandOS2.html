<H1>Recognizing DOS and OS/2 File Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 971 -->
<P>
The OS/2 FAT file system recognizes file objects created by the DOS FAT
file system. This means that applications running under the OS/2 operating
system (these include both OS/2 applications and DOS applications running
in a DOS Session) can access file objects created by applications running
under DOS.
<P>
Because the OS/2 FAT file system supports the same directory structure as
the DOS FAT file system, applications running under DOS can access files
and directories created by the OS/2 FAT file system.
<P>
However, the High Performance File System (HPFS) does not support the same
directory structure as the DOS FAT file system.  Therefore, the DOS FAT
file system will not recognize file objects created by HPFS. This means
that if you start the computer with DOS, applications running under DOS
cannot access files and directories on HPFS disks.
<P>
DOS applications running in a DOS Session under the OS/2 operating system
<I>can</I> recognize files and directories on both FAT and HPFS disks. A
request from a DOS Session to read a file on a FAT disk is handled by the
OS/2 FAT file system. Similarly, a request from a DOS Session to read a
file on an HPFS disk is handled by the OS/2 High Performance File System.
