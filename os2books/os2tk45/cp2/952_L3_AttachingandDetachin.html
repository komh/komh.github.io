<P>
A file system driver that uses a block device driver for I/O operations
to a local or remote (virtual disk) device is called a local file system.
A file system driver that accesses a remote system without a block device
driver is called a remote file system.

An application, typically a network application, can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 4C --> DosFSAttach

<A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 4C -->DosFSAttach</A> establishes or breaks
the connection between a drive or device and a file system. If an attachment
is successful, all requests to that drive or name are routed to the specified
file system. If a detachment is successful, the operating system will no
longer recognize the drive or name in a file system call.

that are not in the system's name space. (<A><!-- external link: 1D 91 C3 FC -->DosFSCtl

<P>
A name space is a set of names that are known to the file system. For example,
CON (console) and PRN (printer) are always in the OS/2 file system's name
space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The following code fragment attaches a drive to a remote file system driver
(FSD). Assume that the FSD does not require any user-supplied data arguments.

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    UCHAR   ucDeviceName[8]; /* Device name or drive letter string */
    UCHAR   ucFSDName[40];   /* FSD name                           */
    PVOID   pDataBuffer;     /* Attach argument data               */
    ULONG   ulDataBufferLen; /* Buffer length                      */
    ULONG   ulOpFlag;        /* Attach or detach                   */
    APIRET  ulrc;            /* Return code                        */

    strcpy(ucDeviceName,"Y:");
                        /* Drive letter with which to attach the */
                        /* file system driver                    */

    strcpy(ucFSDName,"\\lan03\\src");

    pDataBuffer = 0;      /* Assume that no user-supplied data     */
                          /* arguments are required                */

    ulDataBufferLen = 0;  /* No data buffer supplied               */

    ulOpFlag = 0;         /* Indicate Attach request               */

    ulrc = DosFSAttach(ucDeviceName,
                       ucFSDName,
                       pDataBuffer,
                       ulDataBufferLen,
                       ulOpFlag);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosFSAttach error: return code = %ld", ulrc);
        return;
    }
