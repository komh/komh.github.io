<H1>Extended Hardware Buffering</H1><!-- entering slot 1021 -->
<P>
The extended hardware buffering (FIFO-mode) capabilities available in supported
systems apply to the NS-16550A UART device and other fully compatible devices.
These serial devices are installed on many IBM PS/2 system boards, and on
various ASYNC communications adapter options. Refer to <A HREF="968_L5_HardwareSupportforEx.html">Hardware
Support for Extended Hardware Buffering</A>.
<P>
On those systems that incorporate serial devices that fully and compatibly
support Extended Hardware Buffering, the OS/2 ASYNC device driver provides
three modes for exploiting this feature:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enabled<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Disabled<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Automatic Protocol Override<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The default is to enable Automatic Protocol Override on that COM port. Automatic
Protocol Override is an asynchronous device driver mode of operation that
automatically controls various parameters of Extended Hardware Buffering,
such as Receive Trigger Level and Transmit Buffer Load Count.
<P>
Automatic Protocol Override causes the Receive Trigger Level and Transmit
Buffer Load Count to be adjusted according to the device driver handshaking
protocols in effect. When Automatic Protocol Override mode is ON and the
handshaking protocols are set to their default settings, the physical device
driver partially exploits only the performance advantages of Extended Hardware
Buffering. The default handshaking protocols are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Enabled for Input Sensitivity Using DSR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Enabled
for Output Handshaking Using CTS and DSR<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Disabled for Output Handshaking Using DCD<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Disabled for Automatic Transmit Flow Control
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If both Input Sensitivity Using DSR and Output Handshaking Using CTS and
DSR are disabled, the Automatic Protocol Override causes the asynchronous
device driver to automatically reset internal parameters (fully exploiting
the Extended Hardware Buffering capabilities to the maximum extent possible).

<P>
The physical device driver's initialization default is to set Extended Hardware
Buffering capabilities to the Automatic Protocol Override mode. An application
or subsystem can alternatively set Extended Hardware Buffering to DISABLED,
which causes the hardware to service transmit and receive interrupts one
character at a time. It can also set Extended Hardware Buffering to ENABLED,
which causes the physical device driver to set certain Extended Hardware
Buffering parameters to specified levels, so the serial device fully exploits
its Extended Hardware Buffering capabilities to the maximum extent possible.

<P>
When Extended Hardware Buffering is set to ENABLED, the following serial
device hardware capabilities are exploited for maximum performance benefit
and increased receive data integrity:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->By setting the Transmit Buffer Load Count to<I> 16</I>,
up to 16 characters are placed in the transmit hardware buffer (FIFO) during
the processing of one<I> Transmit Holding Register Empty (THRE)</I> interrupt.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A 16-character receive hardware buffer (FIFO) is available
with the Receive Trigger Level set to<I> 1, 4, 8</I>, or<I> 14</I> characters.
The Receive Trigger Level determines when the receive hardware generates
a<I> Receive Data Available</I> hardware interrupt.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the physical device driver receives an Open request for a COM port that
is not already open, it does not alter the Extended Hardware Buffering setting
that is in effect at the time. The ASYNC physical device driver preserves
this state across multiple Open and Close requests.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
