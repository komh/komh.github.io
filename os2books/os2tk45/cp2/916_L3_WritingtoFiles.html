<H1>Writing to Files</H1><!-- entering slot 939 -->
<P>
Once you open a file or have a file handle, you can read from and write
to the file by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 4C --> DosRead</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC -->DosWrite</A>.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 4D -->DosWrite</A> copies bytes from a buffer
you specify to a file, device, or pipe.
<P>
Calling DosWrite with a handle for a file, pipe, or device transfers the
number of bytes specified from a buffer location to the object. The system
returns, in a parameter, the number of bytes actually written (which in
the case of a disk file might not be the same as the number requested because
of insufficient disk space).
<P>
To write to a file, you must first open it for writing or for reading and
writing.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to open the file SAMPLE.TXT again
and write 512 bytes to it:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSFILEMGR   /* File System values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define BUF_SIZE 512

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction;
    BYTE    abBuffer[BUF_SIZE];
    ULONG   cbWritten;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen("SAMPLE.TXT",
                   &amp;hf,
                   &amp;ulAction,
                   0,
                   FILE_NORMAL,
                   FILE_CREATE,
                   OPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE,
                   (PEAOP2) NULL);

    if (!ulrc) {
        DosWrite(hf,
                 abBuffer,
                 sizeof(abBuffer),
                 &amp;cbWritten);

        DosClose(hf);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 4D -->DosWrite</A> writes the contents of
the buffer to the file. If it fails to write 512 bytes (for example, if
the disk is full), the function puts the number of bytes written in the
<I>cbWritten</I> variable. The data is read and written exactly as given;
the function does not format the data-that is, they do not convert binary
data to decimal strings, or vice versa.
<P>
<B>The Write-Through Flag</B>
<BR>
If an application requires data to be written in a specific order, setting
the<I> Write-Through flag</I> to 1 guarantees that actual I/O for a synchronous
write is completed before the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 4D --> DosWrite
</A> returns. If this flag has been set with<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 4B --> DosOpen
</A> for buffered I/O, and multiple synchronous writes are performed, the
system cannot guarantee the actual order in which the data is written. For
details on changing the state of the<I> Write-Through flag</I>, see <A HREF="920_L3_DeterminingandSettin.html">Determining
and Setting the State of a File or Device Handle</A>.
