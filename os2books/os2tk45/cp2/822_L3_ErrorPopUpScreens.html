<H1>Error Pop-Up Screens</H1><!-- entering slot 841 -->
<P>
Some error conditions, such as general protection violations, cause OS/2
to display a pop-up screen containing information about the error. An application
can use DosError to disable error pop-up screens. Typically, a Presentation
Manager application would disable error pop-up screens if it sets up its
own routines to handle errors that would ordinarily generate pop-up screens.

<P>
DosError is also used to control and disable<I> hard errors</I>, which usually
have to do with reading from and writing to disks.
