<H1>Searching for Files Using Metacharacters</H1><!-- entering slot 958 -->
<P>
An asterisk (*) matches 0 or more characters, any character, including blank.
It does not cross NULL or \, which means it only matches a file name, not
an entire path.
<P>
A question mark (?) matches 1 character, unless what it would match is a
period (.) or the terminating NULL, in which case it matches 0 characters.
It also does not cross the backslash character (\).
<P>
Any character, other than asterisks and question marks, matches itself,
including a period.
<P>
Searching is case-insensitive. For example, "FILE.TXT" references the same
file named "file.txt".
<P>
For compatibility reasons, any file name that does not have a dot in it
gets an implicit one automatically appended to the end during searching
operations. This means that searching for "FILE." would return "FILE".
<P>
Some file system functions accept file object name specifications using
metacharacters.
