<P>
Workplace objects are icons representative of physical objects which users
deal with in the Workplace. A Workplace object is implemented as an instance
of a Workplace object class. Workplace object classes are System Object
Model (SOM) object classes which are descendants of the predefined Workplace
object class, <A HREF="066_L2_WPObject.html">WPObject</A>. For more information
about SOM object classes, see<I> System Object Model Guide and Reference</I>.

<P>
All Workplace objects are descendants of a Workplace object storage class.
Workplace storage object classes are responsible primarily for storing and
retrieving object class data for instances of objects which are descendants
(subclasses) of that storage class.
<P>
The three predefined Workplace object storage classes are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
