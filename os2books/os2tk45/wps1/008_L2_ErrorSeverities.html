<P>
Each of the error conditions given in the list of errors for each function
falls into one of these areas:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Warning<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The function detected a problem, but took
some remedial action that enabled the function to complete successfully.
The return code in this case indicates that the function completed successfully.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Error<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The function detected
a problem for which it could not take any sensible remedial action. The
system has recovered from the problem, and the state of the system, with
respect to the application, remains the same as at the time when the function
was requested. The system has not even partially executed the function (other
than reporting the error).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Severe Error<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The
function detected a problem from which the system could not reestablish
its state, with respect to the application, at the time when that function
was requested; that is, the system partially executed the function. This,
therefore, necessitates the application performing some corrective activity
to restore the system to some known state.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Unrecoverable
Error<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> The function detected some problem from which
the system could not reestablish its state, with respect to the application,
at the time when that call was issued. It is possible that the application
cannot perform some corrective action to restore the system to some known
state.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
