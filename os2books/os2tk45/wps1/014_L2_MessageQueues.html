<H1>Message Queues</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->Usually when an application thread uses a PM function,
a message queue must be available for that thread. This means that before
calling the function, WinCreateMsgQueue must be called by the same thread.

<P>
It is recommended that you create a message queue for every thread that
calls any method, since a PM function might be used by the methods you are
calling.
