<P>
This method returns the object for which the handle is a view rather than
the application implementing the view.
<P>
For example, if the<I> hwndFrame</I> of a folder's view is passed in, this
method returns the folder object. If the<I> hwndFrame</I> of the system
editor is passed in, this method returns the object which is currently being
viewed by the editor. In this case, if an associated object cannot be found,
the system editor program object is returned. For instance, if the system
editor is launched from the command line and its<I> hwndFrame</I> is passed
in, the editor program object is returned.
