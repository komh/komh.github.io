<H1>Implicit Pointer Data Types</H1><!-- entering slot 15 -->A data type name beginning with "P" (for example,
PERRORCODE) is likely to be a pointer to another data type (in this instance,
ERRORCODE).
<P>
In the data type summary,<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C5 10 --> Data Types</A>,
no explicit "typedefs" are shown for pointers; therefore, if no data type
definition can be found in the summary for a data type name "Pxxxxxx", it
represents a pointer to the data type "xxxxxx", for which a definition should
be found in the reference.
<P>
The implicit type definition needed for such a pointer "Pxxxxxx" is:
<PRE>
typedef xxxxxx *Pxxxxxx;

</PRE>

<P>
Such definitions are provided in the header files.
