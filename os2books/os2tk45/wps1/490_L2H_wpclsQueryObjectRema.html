<P>
All workplace objects can be uniquely identified by a persistent object
handle within a given machine. Once an object handle is obtained for an
object (using the<A><!-- external link: 1D C7 C4 6F --> wpQueryHandle</A> instance
method), the handle can be used at any subsequent time even if the system
was powered off in the meantime, provided that the object instance has not
been destroyed. This method is intended for use by objects that wish to
communicate with other objects using method calls. At any point in time,
an object can reestablish contact with another object by using this method.
For example, a <A HREF="081_L2_WPShadow.html">WPShadow</A> object will use
this method to get the object pointer to the object it is currently shadowing
when it is made awake. Note that the returned object is locked so that the
called object can access the returned pointer without the risk of the object
being made dormant. When the object pointer is no longer needed, the<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C5 71 --> wpUnlockObject
</A>method should be invoked to permit the system to make that object dormant
when all other locks on it have been released.
<P>
Using<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C5 27 --> HOBJECT</A> for .INI files or
files in which an application uses a rename/save/delete sequence is not
supported.
