A window template consists of a series of statements that define the window
identifier, load and memory options, window dimensions, and controls in
the window. The window template can be loaded from the executable file by
using the WinLoadDlg function.
<P>
You can provide any number of window templates in a resource script file,
but each template must have a unique window-id value.
<P>
A WINDOWTEMPLATE statement can contain DIALOG, CONTROL, and WINDOW statements.
Typically, only one WINDOW statement is used in the WINDOWTEMPLATE statement.
