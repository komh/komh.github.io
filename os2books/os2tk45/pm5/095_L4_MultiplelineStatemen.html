<P>
Multiple-line statements consist of a keyword identifying the resource type,
a constant or number specifying the resource identifier, and, between the
BEGIN and END keywords, additional resource statements that define the resource
data. For example, this MENU statement defines a menu resource:
<PRE>  MENU 1
  BEGIN
      MENUITEM "Alpha", 101
      MENUITEM "Beta",  102
  END
</PRE>

<P>
The menu identifier is 1. The menu contains two MENUITEM statements that
define the contents of the menu.
<P>
In multiple-line statements such as DLGTEMPLATE and WINDOWTEMPLATE, any
level of nested statements is allowed. For example, the DLGTEMPLATE and
WINDOWTEMPLATE statements typically contain a single DIALOG or FRAME statement.
These statements can contain any number of WINDOW and CONTROL statements;
the WINDOW and CONTROL statements can contain additional WINDOW and CONTROL
statements, and so forth. The nested statements let you define controls
and other child windows for the dialog boxes and windows.
<P>
If a nested statement creates a child window or control, the parent and
owner of the new window is the window created by the containing statement.
(FRAME statements occasionally create frame controls whose parent and owner
windows are not the same.)
