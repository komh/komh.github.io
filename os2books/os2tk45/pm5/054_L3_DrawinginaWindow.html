<P>
Ideally, all drawing in a window occurs as a result of an application's
processing a WM_PAINT message.  Applications maintain an internal representation
of what must be displayed in the window, such as text or a linked list of
graphics objects, and use the WM_PAINT message as a cue to display a visual
representation of that data in the window.
<P>
To route all display output through the WM_PAINT message, an application
must not draw on the screen at the time its data changes.  Instead, it must
update the internal representation of the data and call the WinInvalidateRect
or WinInvalidateRegion functions to invalidate the portion of the window
that must be redrawn.  Sometimes it is much more efficient to draw directly
in a window without relying on the WM_PAINT message-for example, when drawing
and redrawing an object for a user who is using the mouse to drag or size
the object.
<P>
If a window has the WS_SYNCPAINT or CS_SYNCPAINT style, invalidating a portion
of the window causes a WM_PAINT message to be sent to the window immediately.
 Essentially, sending a message is like making a function call; the actions
corresponding to the WM_PAINT message are carried out before the call that
caused the invalidation returns-that is to say, the painting is synchronous.

<P>
If the window does not have the WS_SYNCPAINT or CS_SYNCPAINT style, invalidating
a portion of the window causes the invalidated region to be added to the
window's update region.  The next time the application calls the WinGetMsg
or WinPeekMsg functions, the application is sent a WM_PAINT message.  If
there are many messages in the queue, the painting occurs after the invalidation-that
is, the painting is asynchronous.  A WM_PAINT message is not posted to the
queue in this case, so all invalidation operations since the last WM_PAINT
message are consolidated into a single WM_PAINT message the next time the
application has no messages in the queue.
<P>
There are advantages to both synchronous and asynchronous painting.  Windows
that have simple painting functions should be painted synchronously.  Most
of the system-defined control windows, such as buttons and frame controls,
are painted synchronously because they can be painted quickly without interfering
with the responsiveness of the program.  Windows that require more time-consuming
painting operations should be painted asynchronously so that the painting
can be initiated only when there are no other pending messages that might
otherwise be blocked while waiting for the window to be painted.  Also,
a window that uses an incremental approach to invalidating small portions
of itself usually should allow those operations to consolidate into a single
asynchronous WM_PAINT message, rather than a series of synchronous WM_PAINT
messages. If necessary, an application can call the WinUpdateWindow function
to cause an asynchronous window to update itself without going through the
event loop.  WinUpdateWindow sends a WM_PAINT message directly to the window
if the window's update region is not empty.
