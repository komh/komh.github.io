<H1>Static Control Handle</H1><!-- entering slot 383 -->
<P>
Every static control is associated with a 32-bit data field. A static control
with the SS_BITMAP or SS_ICON style uses this field to store the handle
of the bit map or icon that it displays. An application can obtain that
handle by sending the SM_QUERYHANDLE message to the control. An application
can replace the bit map or icon by sending the SM_SETHANDLE message to the
control, specifying a valid icon or bit map handle. Changing the handle
causes the system to redraw the control.
<P>
For a non-icon or non-bit map static control, the data field is available
for application-defined data and has no effect on the appearance of the
control.
<P>
An application can retrieve the data field of a static control window by
calling WinWindowFromID, using the handle of the owner and the window identifier
of the static control. The static control window identifier is specified
in either the dialog-window template or WinCreateWindow.
