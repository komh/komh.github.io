<H1>About Window Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 463 -->
<P>
Every window is a member of a window class.  An application must specify
a window class when it creates a window.  Each window class has an associated
<I>window procedure</I> that is used by all windows of the same class.  The
window procedure handles messages for all windows of that class and, therefore,
controls the behavior and appearance of the window.
<P>
A window class must be<I> registered</I> before an application can create
a window of that class.  Registering a window class associates a window
procedure and class styles with a class name.  When an application specifies
the class name in a window-creation function such as WinCreateWindow, the
system creates a window that uses the window procedure and styles associated
with the class name.
<P>
An application can register private classes or use preregistered public
window classes.
