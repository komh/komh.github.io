<P>
Each window of a specific window class uses the window procedure associated
with that class.  An application can create one or more windows that belong
to the same window class.  Because each window of the same class is processed
by the same window procedure, they all behave the same way.  Since many
windows can result from one window procedure, coding overhead is greatly
reduced.  There are two types of window classes: public and private.
