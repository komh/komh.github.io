<P>
Public window classes are registered during system initialization.  Their
window procedures are in dynamic link libraries.  Therefore, to use a public
window class, an application need not register it.  Nor does the application
need to import the window procedure for a public window class because the
system resolves references to the window procedure.
<P>
An application cannot use a public window class name when it registers a
private window class.
