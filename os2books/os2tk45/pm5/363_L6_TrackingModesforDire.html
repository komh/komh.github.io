<H1>Tracking Modes for Direct Manipulation</H1><!-- entering slot 363 -->
<BR>
There are two tracking modes used for direct manipulation of the circular
slider: scrolling the dial and point selection.
<BR>

<P>
The default tracking behavior is scrolling, where the dial position of the
slider is changed gradually. For example, by holding down the select mouse
button while the pointer is positioned on the indicator line of the dial,
you can move the mouse and cause the dial to rotate. This gradual changing
of the dial value might be desirable for a volume control.
<P>
If the CSS_POINTSELECT style is specified for the circular slider, the position
of the dial is changed immediately to a point on the scale that has been
selected by the mouse. Point selection allows value changes to occur immediately.
