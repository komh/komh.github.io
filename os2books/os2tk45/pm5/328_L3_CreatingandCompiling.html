<H1>Creating and Compiling a Resource File</H1><!-- entering slot 328 -->
<P>
The resource compiler (RC) compiles a resource script file to create a new
file, called a binary resource file, which has a .RES file-name extension.
The binary resource file can be added to the executable file of the application,
thereby replacing any existing resources in that file.
<P>
The RC command line has the following three basic forms:
<PRE>  rc resource-script-file [executable-file]

  rc binary-resource-file [executable-file]

  rc -r  resource-script-file [binary-resource-file]
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The third option does not add to the executable file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
 The<I> resource-script-file</I> parameter is the file name of the resource
script file to be compiled.
<P>
The<I> executable-file</I> parameter must be the name of the executable
file to receive the compiled resources. This is a file having a file-name
extension of either .EXE or .DLL. If you omit the executable-file field,
RC adds the compiled resources to the executable file that has the same
name as the resource script file but which has the .EXE file-name extension.

<P>
The<I> binary-resource-file</I> parameter is the name of the binary resource
file to be added to the executable file.
<P>
The<I> -r</I> option directs RC to compile the resource script file without
adding it to an executable file.
