<P>
Many of the characters required by each code page are common; for example,
the first 128 characters of all the ASCII code pages are identical. This
set of characters is called the Universal Glyph List (UGL). A code page
is simply a set of pointers into the UGL.
<P>
As the characters in every font are in the same order, only one set of code-page
translation tables is necessary.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The fonts of Microsoft Windows support only code page 1004.
