<UL> If
the cursor is on a major or minor tab, the associated page is brought to
the top of the notebook, and the selected tab is given the same background
color as the notebook page area. The other tabs have their color specified
in the BKM_SETNOTEBOOKCOLORS message. This helps the user distinguish the
selected tab from the other tabs if different colors are used.

to the top of the notebook. If the cursor is currently on the left page
button, the previous page is brought to the top of the notebook.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Mnemonics
<!-- lm: 0x12 26 -->
<UL>Mnemonics are underlined characters in the text
of a tab that cause the tab's page to be selected. Coding a tilde (~) before
a text character in the BKM_SETTABTEXT message causes that character to
be underlined and activates it as a mnemonic-selection character.
<P>
A user performs mnemonic selection by pressing a character key that corresponds
to an underlined character. When this happens, the tab that contains the
underlined character is selected, and that tab's page is brought to the
top of the notebook.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Mnemonic selection is not case sensitive, so the user can
type the underscored letter in either uppercase or lowercase.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
