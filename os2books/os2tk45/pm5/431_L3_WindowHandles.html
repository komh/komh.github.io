<P>
After creating a window, the creation function returns a window handle that
uniquely identifies the window.  An application can use this handle to direct
the action of functions to the window.  Window handles have the data type
HWND; applications must use this data type when declaring variables that
hold window handles.
<P>
There are special constants that an application can use instead of a window
handle in certain functions.  For example, an application can use HWND_DESKTOP
in the WinCreateWindow function to specify the desktop window as the new
window's parent. Similarly, HWND_OBJECT represents the desktop-object window.
 HWND_TOP and HWND_BOTTOM represent the top and bottom positions relative
to the z-order position of a window.
<P>
Although the NULL constant is not a window handle, an application can use
it in some functions to specify that no window is affected.  For example,
an application can use NULL in the WinCreateWindow function to create a
window that has no owner window.  Some functions might return NULL, indicating
that the given action applies to no window.
