<P>
Subclassing enables an application to intercept and process messages sent
or posted to a window before that window has a chance to process them.  Subclassing
most often is used to add functionality to a particular window or to alter
a window's default behavior.
<P>
An application subclasses a window by using the WinSubclassWindow function
to replace the window's original window procedure with an application-defined
window procedure.  Thereafter, the new window procedure processes any messages
that are sent or posted to the window.  If the new window procedure does
not process a particular message, it must pass the message to the original
window procedure,<I> not</I> to WinDefWindowProc, for default processing.
