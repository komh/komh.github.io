<P>
A<I> maximized window</I> is a window that has been enlarged to fill the
screen.  Although a window's size can be set so that it fills the screen
exactly, a maximized window is slightly different: the system automatically
moves the window's title bar to the top of the screen and sets the WS_MAXIMIZED
style for the window.
<P>
A<I> minimized window</I> is a window whose size has been reduced to exactly
the size of an icon<I> or</I>, in the Workplace Shell<B>*</B>, it disappears
altogether (by default). Like a maximized window, a minimized window is
more than just a window of a given size; typically, the system moves the
(icon) minimized window to the lower part of the screen and sets the WS_MINIMIZED
style for that window.  The lower part of the screen is sometimes called
the<I> icon area</I>.  Unless the application specifies another position,
the system moves a minimized window into the first available icon position
in the icon area.
<P>
If a window is created with the WS_MAXIMIZED or WS_MINIMIZED styles, the
system draws the window as a maximized or minimized window.
<P>
An application can restore maximized or minimized windows to their previous
size and position by specifying the SWP_RESTORE flag in a call to the WinSetWindowPos
function.
