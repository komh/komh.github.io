<H1>About Value Set Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 396 -->
<P>
Even though text is supported, the purpose of a value set control is to
display choices as graphic images for faster selection. The user can<I> see
</I>the selections instead of having to take time to read descriptions of
the choices. Using graphic images in a value set also lets you conserve
space on the display screen. For example, if you want to let a user choose
from a variety of patterns, you can present those patterns as value set
choices, If long strings of data are to be displayed as choices, radio buttons
should be used. However, for small sets of numeric or textual information,
you can use either a value set or radio buttons.
<P>
The value set is customizable to meet varying application requirements,
while providing a user interface component that can be used easily to develop
products that conform to the Common User Access (CUA) user interface guidelines.
The application can specify different types of items, sizes, and orientations
for its value sets, but the underlying function of the control remains the
same. For a complete description of CUA value sets, refer to the<I> SAA
CUA Guide to User Interface Design</I> and the<I> SAA CUA Advanced Interface
Design Reference</I>.
