<P>
The system saves the bits beneath a window with this style when the window
is displayed.  When the window moves or is hidden, the system simply restores
the uncovered bits.  This operation can consume a great deal of memory;
it is recommended only for transient windows such as menus and dialog boxes-not
for main application windows.  This style also is inappropriate for windows
that are updated dynamically, such as clocks.
