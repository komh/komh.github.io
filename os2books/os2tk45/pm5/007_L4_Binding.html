<H1>Binding</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
The notebook control resembles a real notebook in its general appearance.
The default binding is solid and is placed on the left side. This binding
is used if the BKS_SOLIDBIND style bit is specified or if no style bit is
specified.
<P>
Two styles are provided for the notebook binding: solid and spiral. The
notebook is displayed with a solid binding by default, but the application
can specify BKS_SPIRALBIND to display a spiral binding.
<P>
The placement of the binding depends entirely on the placement of the back
pages and major tabs, respectively. The binding always is located on the
opposite side of the notebook from the major tabs.
