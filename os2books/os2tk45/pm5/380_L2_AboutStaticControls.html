<H1>About Static Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 381 -->
<P>
Unlike the other types of control windows, a static control does not accept
user input or send notification messages to its owner. The primary advantage
of a static control is that it provides a label or graphic that requires
little attention from an application. At most, an application might change
the text or position of a static control.
