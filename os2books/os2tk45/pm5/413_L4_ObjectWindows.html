<H1>Object Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 415 -->
<P>
Any descendant of the desktop-object window is called an<I> object window</I>.
 Typically, an application uses an object window to provide services for
another window.  For example, an application can use an object window to
manage a shared database.  In this way, a window can obtain information
from the shared database by sending a message to and receiving a reply from
the object window.
<P>
Only two system-defined messages are available to an object window-WM_CREATE
and WM_DESTROY-but the object window enables the user to implement a set
of user-defined messages.  The window procedure for an object window does
not have to process paint messages or user input.  The object window processes
only messages that affect the data belonging to the object.
<P>
HWND_OBJECT is the only identifier needed to create an object window.  It
is very unwise to create descendants of HWND_OBJECT in the same thread that
creates descendants of HWND_DESKTOP: this causes the system to hang up or,
at the very least, behave slowly.  Object windows, sometimes referred to
as<I> orphan</I> windows, require no owner.
<P>
The rules for parent-child and ownership relationships also apply to object
windows.  In particular, changing the parent window of an object window
to the desktop window, or to a descendant of the desktop window, causes
the system to display the object window if the object window has the WS_VISIBLE
style.
