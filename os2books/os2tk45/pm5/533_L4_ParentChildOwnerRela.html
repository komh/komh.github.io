<H1>Parent/Child/Owner Relationship</H1><!-- entering slot 551 -->
<P>
The format of the DLGTEMPLATE and WINDOWTEMPLATE resources is very general
to allow tree-structured relationships within the resource format. The general
layout of the templates is:
<PRE>
WINDOWTEMPLATE id
BEGIN
    WINDOW winTop             the top-level window
    BEGIN
        WINDOW wind1
        WINDOW wind2
        WINDOW wind3
        BEGIN
            WINDOW wind4
        END
        WINDOW wind5
    END
END

</PRE>
In this example, the top-level window is identified by<B> winTop</B>. It
has four child windows:<B> wind1</B>,<B> wind2</B>,<B> wind3</B>, and<B> wind5</B>.
 <B>wind3</B> has one child window,<B> wind4</B>. When each of these windows
is created, the parent and the owner are set to be the same.
<P>
The only time when the parent and owner windows are not the same is when
frame controls are automatically created by a frame window.
<P>
Note that the WINDOW statements in the example above could also have been
CONTROL or DIALOG statements.
