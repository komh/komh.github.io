<P>
A user can select a value by using the navigation keys to move the slider
arm to the value or by typing a value in an entry field, if one is provided
by the application, to change the slider arm position. The following list
describes these methods of selecting slider values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Values can be selected using the Up, Down, Left, and
Right Arrow keys to move the slider arm one increment at a time. The Up
and Down Arrow keys are enabled for vertical sliders, and the Right and
Left Arrow keys are enabled for horizontal sliders. If no tick mark exists
on the scale in the requested direction, the slider arm does not move.
<P>
If an Arrow key is pressed in conjunction with the Shift key, the slider
arm moves to the next detent instead of the next tick mark. If no detent
exists on the scale in the requested direction, the slider arm does not
move.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Home and End keys can be used to select the lowest
and highest values, respectively, in the scale. If the Ctrl key is pressed
in combination with the Home or End keys, the result is the same as pressing
only the Home or End keys.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The application can provide an optional entry field
for the slider control. The entry field is a separate control, but it can
work in conjunction with the slider control.
<P>
If the application provides an entry field for the slider control window,
it must be implemented as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The user must be allowed to type a value into the
entry field.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If the typed value is within the range of the slider
scale, the slider arm moves to that value as soon as the value is typed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->No other action, such as pressing the Enter key,
is required.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
