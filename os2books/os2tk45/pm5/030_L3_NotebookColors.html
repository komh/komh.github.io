<P>
The application can change the color of any part of the notebook. The colors
of some parts can be changed by specifying presentation parameter attributes
in WinSetPresParam. Other colors can be changed by specifying notebook attributes
in the BKM_SETNOTEBOOKCOLORS message. The following sections define which
parts of the notebook can have their colors changed by each of these two
methods.
