<P>
The statement defines the position and dimensions of the dialog box on the
screen, as well as the dialog-box style. The DIALOG statement is most often
used in a DLGTEMPLATE statement.
<P>
Typically, you use only one DIALOG statement in each DLGTEMPLATE statement,
and the DIALOG statement contains at least one control definition.
<P>
The exact meaning of the coordinates depends on the style defined by the
<I>style</I> field. For dialog boxes with FS_SCREENALIGN style, the coordinates
are relative to the origin of the display screen. For dialog boxes with
the style FS_MOUSEALIGN, the coordinates are relative to the position of
the mouse pointer at the time the dialog box is created. For all other dialog
boxes, the coordinates are relative to the origin of the parent window.

<P>
The DIALOG statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL, DIALOG,
and WINDOW statements. Typically, a DIALOG statement contains one or more
CONTROL statements.
