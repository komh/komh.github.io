<H1>Scroll-Bar Slider Size</H1><!-- entering slot 338 -->
<P>
The slider can be displayed either as a square (the default), or as a portion
of the scroll bar if SBCDATA and the SBS_THUMBSIZE style are specified at
creation. Displaying the slider as a proportional rectangle permits the
size of the slider to be proportional to the amount of data being viewed
in the visible range. The size is set based on the visible range and the
number of values in the range. As an example, where the viewing area is
20 items and the range is 100, the slider size would be 20% of the potential
slider area. Note that there is no direct connection between the scroll
bar range and the range value used to set the slider size.  It is possible
to set the scroll-bar range from 0-99, and base the slider size on a viewing
area of 500 and a range of 1000.  This will set the scroll-bar to have 100
positions and will display a slider that is half the size of the scroll
bar.
<P>
The slider size can be set using SBM_SETTHUMBSIZE or WM_SETWINDOWPARAMS,
and obtained using WM_QUERYWINDOWPARAMS.
