<P>
Any window can have an<I> owner window</I>.  Typically, an application uses
ownership to establish a connection between windows so that they can perform
useful tasks together.  For example, the title bar in an application's main
window is owned by the frame window; but, together, the user can move the
entire main window by clicking the mouse in the title bar and dragging.
 An application can set the owner window when it creates the window or at
a later time.
<P>
Ownership establishes a relationship between windows that is independent
of the parent-child relationship.  While there are few predefined rules
for owner- and owned-window interaction, a window<I> always</I> notifies
its owner of anything considered a<I> significant event</I>.
<P>
The preregistered public window classes provided by the OS/2 operating system
recognize ownership.  Control windows of classes such as WC_TITLEBAR and
WC_SCROLLBAR, notify their owners of events; frame windows, of class WC_FRAME,
receive and process notification messages from the control windows they
own.  For example, a title-bar control sends a notification message to its
owner when it receives a mouse click.  If the owner is a frame window, it
receives the notification message and prepares to move itself and its children.

<P>
Owner and owned windows must be created by the same thread; that is, they
must belong to the same message queue.  Because ownership is independent
of the parent-child relationship, the owner and owned windows do not have
to be descendants of the same parent window.  However, this can affect how
windows are destroyed.  Destroying an owner window does not necessarily
destroy an owned window.  Except for frame windows, an application that
needs to destroy an owned window that is not a descendant of the owner window
must do so explicitly.
<P>
Frame windows sometimes own windows that are not descendants but, instead,
are siblings.  A frame window has the following special ownership properties:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the frame window is destroyed, it destroys all
of the windows it owns, even if they are not descendants.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When a frame window moves, the windows it owns move
also.  Owned windows that are not descendants maintain their positions,
relative to the upper-left (not the usual lower-left) corner of the owner
window.  An owned window with the style FS_NOMOVEWITHOWNER does not move.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the frame window changes its position in the
z-order, it changes the z-order of all the windows it owns.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the frame window is minimized or hidden, it hides
all the windows it owns.  Owned windows hidden this way are restored when
the frame window is restored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If an application needs this type of special processing for its own window
classes, it must provide that support in the window procedures for those
classes.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Never create a window with an owner being a window in a different
process. This causes problems when destroying the owned- or owner-window;
usually the owned- or owner-window hangs.
