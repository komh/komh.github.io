<H1>Setting and Querying Page Information</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
The information for a page in the notebook can be set and queried with BKM_SETPAGEINFO
and BKM_QUERYPAGEINFO respectively. By using these messages, all the information
associated with a page can be accessed at once. In addition, BKM_SETPAGEINFO
can be used to delay the loading of a page until it is turned to, by setting
the<I> bLoadDlg</I> field to FALSE. By doing this for all pages in a notebook,
the notebook is created much more quickly.
