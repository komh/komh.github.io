<P>
The normal presentation space supports the full power of the operating system
graphics, including retained graphics.  The primary advantages of a normal
presentation space over the other two presentation-space types are its support
of all graphics functions and its ability to be associated with many kinds
of device contexts.
<P>
A normal presentation space can be associated with many different device
contexts.  Typically, this means that an application creates a normal presentation
space and associates it with a window device context for screen display.
 When the user asks to print, the application associates the same presentation
space with a printer device context.  Later, the application can reassociate
the presentation space with the window device context.  A presentation space
can be associated with only one device context at a time, but the normal
presentation space enables the application to change the device context
whenever necessary.
<P>
When creating a normal presentation space, an application can associate
it with a device context or defer the association to a later time.  The
GpiAssociate function associates a device context with a normal presentation
space after the presentation space has been created.  An application typically
associates the normal presentation space with a device context when calling
the GpiCreatePS function and, later, associates the presentation space with
a different device context by calling GpiAssociate.  To obtain a device
context for a window, call the WinOpenWindowDC function.  To obtain a device
context for a device other than the screen, call the DevOpenDC function.

<P>
An application typically creates a normal presentation space during initialization
and uses it until termination.  Each time the application receives a WM_PAINT
message, it passes the handle of the normal presentation space as an argument
to WinBeginPaint; this prevents the system from returning a cached-micro
presentation space.  The system modifies the visible region of the supplied
normal presentation space and returns the presentation space to the application.
 This method enables the application to use the same presentation space
for all the drawing in a specified window. Normal presentation spaces created
using GpiCreatePS must be destroyed by calling GpiDestroyPS before the application
terminates.  Do not call WinReleasePS to release a presentation space obtained
using GpiCreatePS.  Before terminating, applications also must use DevCloseDC
to close any device contexts opened using DevOpenDC.  No action is necessary
for device contexts obtained using WinOpenWindowDC, because the system automatically
closes these device contexts when destroying the associated windows.
