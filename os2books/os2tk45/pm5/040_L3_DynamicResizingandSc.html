<H1>Dynamic Resizing and Scrolling</H1><!-- entering slot 40 -->
<P>
The notebook control supports<I> dynamic resizing</I> by recalculating the
size of the notebook's parts when either the user or the application changes
the size of any of those parts. A BKN_NEWPAGESIZE notification code is sent
from the notebook to the application whenever the notebook's size changes.

<P>
The notebook handles the sizing and positioning of each application page
window if the BKA_AUTOPAGESIZE attribute is specified for the inserted notebook
page. Otherwise, the application must handle this when it receives the BKN_NEWPAGESIZE
notification code from the notebook.
<P>
If the size of the notebook window is decreased so that the page window
is not large enough to display all the information the page contains, the
information in the page window is clipped. If scroll bars are desired to
enable the clipped information to be scrolled into view, they must be provided
by the application. Tab scroll buttons are automatically displayed if the
size of the notebook is decreased so that all the major or minor tabs cannot
be displayed. For example, a notebook has major tabs on the right side,
but the height of the notebook does not allow all the tabs to be displayed.
In this case, tab scroll buttons are displayed on the upper- and lower-right
corners of the notebook.
