<P>
A help-subtable resource contains a help-subitem entry for each item that
can be selected in an application window. Each of these items should be
a child window of the application window specified in the help-table resource.
The help subtable should contain a help subitem for each control, child
window, and menu item in the application window.
<P>
You can provide any number of HELPSUBTABLE statements in a resource script
file, but each statement must specify a unique helpsubtable-id value. You
can also provide any number of helpsubitem-definition statements in the
help subtable. These specify the child window for which help is provided,
the help panel containing the help text for the child window, and one or
more application-defined integers.
<P>
If you include optional integers in the helpsubitem-definition statements,
you must also include a SUBITEMSIZE statement to specify the size, in words,
of each help subitem. All help subitems in a help subtable must be the same
size. The default size is two words per help subitem.
