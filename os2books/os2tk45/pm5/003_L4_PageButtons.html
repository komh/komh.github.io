<H1>Page Buttons</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
In the bottom-right corner of the notebook are the<I> page buttons</I>.
These buttons let you bring one page of the notebook into view at a time.
They are a standard component that is automatically provided with every
old notebook. However, the application can change the default width and
height of the page buttons by using the BKM_SETDIMENSIONS message. The page
buttons always are located in the corner where the recessed edges of the
notebook intersect.
<P>
Selecting the<I> forward page button</I> (the arrow pointing to the right)
causes the next page to be displayed and selecting the<I> backward page
button</I> (the arrow pointing to the left) causes the previous page to
be displayed. Prior to inserting pages in the notebook, the page buttons
are displayed with unavailable-state emphasis;  therefore, selecting either
page button would not bring a page into view.
