<P>
The basic window-creation function is WinCreateWindow.  This function uses
information about a window's class, style, size, and position to create
a new window.  All other window-creation functions, such as WinCreateStdWindow
and WinCreateDlg, supply some of this information by default and create
windows of a specific class or style.
<P>
Although the WinCreateWindow function provides the most direct means of
creating a window, most applications do not use it.  Instead, they often
use the WinCreateStdWindow function to create a main window and the WinDlgBox
or WinCreateDlg functions to create dialog windows.
<P>
The WinCreateMenu, WinLoadMenu, WinLoadDlg, WinMessageBox, and WinCreateFrameControls
functions also create windows.  Each of these functions substitutes for
one or more required calls to WinCreateWindow to create a given window.
 For example, an application can create a frame window, one or more control
windows, and a client window in a single call to WinCreateStdWindow.
