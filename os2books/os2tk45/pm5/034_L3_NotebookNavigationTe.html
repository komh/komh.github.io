<P>
The notebook control supports the use of a pointing device and the keyboard
for displaying notebook pages and tabs and for moving the selection cursor
from the notebook tabs to the application window and the other way around.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If more than one notebook window is open, displaying a page
or tab in one notebook window has no effect on the pages or tabs displayed
in any other notebook window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
