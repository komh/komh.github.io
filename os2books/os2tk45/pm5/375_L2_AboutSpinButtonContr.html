<H1>About Spin Button Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 376 -->
<P>
A<I> spin button</I> consists of at least one spin field that is a single-line
entry (SLE) field, and up and down arrows that are stacked on top of one
another. These arrows are positioned to the right of the SLE field.
<P>
You can create multi-field spin buttons for those applications in which
users must select more than one value. For example, in setting a date, the
spin button control can provide individual fields for setting the month,
day, and year. The first spin field in the spin button could contain a list
of months; the second, a list of numbers; and the third, a list of years.

<P>
The application uses a multi-field spin button by creating one master component
that contains a spin field and the spin arrows, and servant components that
contain only spin fields. The spin buttons are created at component initialization.
The servant components are passed a handle to the master component in a
message. When a servant spin field has the focus, it is spun by the arrows
in the master component.
<P>
The list of values in a spin button entry field can be an array of data
or a list of consecutive integers, defined by an upper and a lower limit.
