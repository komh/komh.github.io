<P>
An application can use several types of<I> secondary</I> windows:  frame
windows, client windows, control windows, dialog windows, message boxes,
and menus.  Typically, an application's main window consists of several
of these windows acting as one.
<P>
A<I> frame window</I> is a window that an application uses as the base when
constructing a main window or other composite window, such as a dialog window
or message box.  (A<I> composite window</I> is a collection of windows that
interact with one another and are kept together as a unit.)  A frame window
provides basic features, such as borders and a menu bar.  Frame windows
have a set of resources associated with them.  These include icons, menus,
and accelerators (<I>shortcut keys</I> to the user), which, typically, are
defined in an application's resource file.
<P>
A<I> dialog window</I> is a frame window that contains one or more control
windows.  Dialog windows are used almost exclusively for prompting the user
for input.  An application usually creates a dialog window when it needs
additional information to complete a command.  The application destroys
the dialog window after the user has provided the requested information.

<P>
A<I> message box</I> is a frame window that an application uses to display
a note, caution, or warning to the user.  For instance, an application can
use a message box to inform the user of a problem that the application encountered
while performing a task.
<P>
A<I> client window</I> is the window in which the application displays the
current document or data.  For example, a desktop-publishing application
displays the current page of a document in a client window.  Most applications
create at least one client window.  The application must provide a function,
called a<I> window procedure</I>, to process input to the client window
and to display output.
<P>
A<I> control window</I> is a window used in conjunction with another window
to perform useful tasks, such as displaying a menu or scrolling information
in a client window.  The operating system provides several predefined control-window
classes that an application can use to create control windows.  Control
windows include buttons, entry fields, list boxes, combination boxes, menus,
scroll bars, static text, and title bars.
<P>
A<I> menu</I> is a control window that presents a list of commands and other
menus to the user.  Using a mouse or the keyboard, the user can select a
task; the application then performs the selected task.
