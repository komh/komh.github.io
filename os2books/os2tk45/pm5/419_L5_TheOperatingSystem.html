<H1>The Operating System</H1><!-- entering slot 421 -->
<P>
Managing the application windows on the screen, the operating system issues
messages to the windows, usually as an indirect result of user interaction.
 These messages enable the system to work in a uniform and well-ordered
manner.  For example, where several application windows overlap, and the
user terminates an application so that its window disappears, the operating
system issues messages to the underlying application windows so that they
can repaint themselves.
