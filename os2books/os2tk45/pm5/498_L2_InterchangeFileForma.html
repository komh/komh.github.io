A metafile is a file in which graphics are stored. The file is application-created,
and it contains the graphics orders generated from those GPI calls that
are valid in a metafile. Metafiled graphics can be reused by the application
that created them. They can also be made available to other applications
at the same, or at a different, workstation.
<P>
This section describes the restrictions which apply when generating the
metafile and gives detail of the overall structure. For the graphics orders
descriptions, see "Graphics Orders" in the<I><I> Graphics Programming Interface
Programming Reference</I>.
