<P>
The control is a rectangle in which the user can type and edit multiple
lines of text. The control displays a pointer when the user selects it.
The user can then use the keyboard to enter text or edit the existing text.
Editing keys include the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys. By using the mouse or
the DIRECTION keys, the user can select the characters to delete or select
the place to insert new characters. The MLE statement, which you can use
only in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement, defines the text, identifier, dimensions,
and attributes of a control window. The predefined class for this control
is WC_MLE. If you do not specify a style, the default style is MLS_BORDER,
WS_GROUP, and WS_TABSTOP.
