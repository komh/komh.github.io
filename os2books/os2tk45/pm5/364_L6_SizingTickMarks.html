When a low-resolution display is being used, or in situations where the
circular slider must be made very small, the length of the tick marks can
be sized proportionately to allow effective sizing of the circular slider.
Specifying the CSS_PROPORTIONALTICKS style causes the length of the tick
marks to be calculated as a percentage of the dial's radius. This style
does not adversely affect the size of the push buttons and bit-map graphics
an application might provide.
