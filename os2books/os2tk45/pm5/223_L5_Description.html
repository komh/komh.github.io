<P>
This statement defines the text, identifier, and attributes of a menu item.
Use the MENUITEM statement only in a MENU or SUBMENU statement.
<P>
The system displays the text when it displays the corresponding menu. If
the user chooses the menu item, the system generates a WM_COMMAND message
that includes the specified menu-item identifier and sends it to the window
owning the menu.
<P>
You can provide any number of MENUITEM statements, but each must have a
unique menu-id value.
<P>
The alternative form of the MENUITEM statement, MENUITEM SEPARATOR, creates
a menu separator. A menu separator is a horizontal dividing bar between
two menu items in a submenu. The separator is not active - that is, the
user cannot choose it, it has no text associated with it, and it has no
identifier.
<P>
You can use the \t or \a character combination in any item name. The \t
character inserts a tab when the name is displayed and is typically used
to separate the menu-item name from the name of an accelerator key. The
\a character aligns to the right all text that follows it. These characters
are intended to be used for menu items in submenus only. The width of the
displayed submenu is always adjusted so there is at least one space (and
usually more) between any pieces of text separated by a \t or \a. (When
compiling the menu resource, the compiler stores the \t and \a characters
as control characters. For example, the \t is stored as 0x09.)
<P>
A tilde ( ~ ) character in the item name indicates that the following character
is used as a mnemonic character for the item. When the menu is displayed,
the tilde is not shown, but the mnemonic character is underlined. The user
can choose the menu item by pressing the key corresponding to the underlined
mnemonic character.
