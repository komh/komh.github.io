<P>
An application can draw in a window's presentation space without having
received a WM_PAINT message.  As long as there is a presentation space for
the window, an application can draw into the presentation space and avoid
intruding into other windows or the desktop.  Applications that draw without
using the WM_PAINT message typically call the WinGetPS function to obtain
a cached-micro presentation space for the window and call the WinReleasePS
function when they have finished drawing.  An application also can use any
of the other types of presentation spaces described in the following sections.
