<P>
The contents of both script files are compiled by RC and the results are
placed in one binary resource file and/or executable file.
<P>
RCINCLUDE statements are processed before any other processing is done,
including preprocessing by RCPP.EXE, which removes comments, replaces values
in the define directives, and so forth.
<P>
When specifying a high performance file system (HPFS) file name on an RCINCLUDE
statement, enclose the path and file name in double quotes; for example:

<PRE>   RCINCLUDE "d:\project\long dialog.dlg"
</PRE>

<P>
Double quotes enable the resource compiler to recognize a name containing
embedded blank characters.
