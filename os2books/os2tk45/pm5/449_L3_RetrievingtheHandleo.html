<H1>Retrieving the Handle of a Child or Owned Window</H1><!-- entering slot 454 -->
<P>
A parent or owner window can retrieve the handle of a child or owned window
by using the WinWindowFromID function and supplying the identifier of the
child or owned window.  WinWindowFromID searches all child and owned windows
to locate the window with the given identifier.  The window identifier is
set when the application creates the child or owned window.
<P>
Typically, an owned window uses WinQueryWindow to get the handle of the
owner window; then uses WinSendMsg to issue a notification message to its
owner window.
<P>
The code fragment in the following figure retrieves the window handle of
an owner window and sends the window a WM_ENABLE message.
<PRE>    HWND hwndOwned;
    HWND hwndOwner;

    case WM_CONTROL:
        switch (SHORT2FROMMP (mp2)) {
            case BN_CLICKED:
                hwndOwned = WinWindowFromID(hwndOwner,
                (ULONG)SHORT1FROMMP(mp1));
                WinSendMsg(hwndOwned, WM_ENABLE,
                (MPARAM)TRUE, (MPARAM) NULL);
                return 0;
            .
            . /* Check for other notification codes. */
            .

            }

</PRE>

<P>
An application also can retrieve the handle of a child window by using the
WinWindowFromPoint function and supplying a point in the corresponding parent
window.
