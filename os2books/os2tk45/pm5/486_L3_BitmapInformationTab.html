<H1>Bitmap Information Tables</H1><!-- entering slot 493 -->
<P>
Each standard-format bitmap must be accompanied by a bitmap information
table. Because the standard-format bitmaps are intended to be traded between
devices, the color indexes in the bitmap are meaningless without more information;
for a description of this structure, see<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C7 FC --> BITMAPINFO2</A>.

<P>
Some functions use a structure that is similar to<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C7 0F --> BITMAPINFO2
</A>but does not have the color table array; for a description of this structure,
see<A><!-- external link: 1D C3 C7 FC --> BITMAPINFOHEADER2</A>. Wherever
<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C7 0F -->BITMAPINFO2</A> is shown,<A><!-- external link: 1D C0 C7 0E --> BITMAPINFO
</A>is also allowed. Similarly, wherever<A><!-- external link: 1D C3 C7 11 --> BITMAPINFOHEADER2
</A>is shown,<A><!-- external link: 1D C2 C7 10 --> BITMAPINFOHEADER</A> is
also allowed.
