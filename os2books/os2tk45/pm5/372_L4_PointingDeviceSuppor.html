<P>
A user can select slider values with a pointing device. The CUA guidelines
defines mouse button 1 (the select button) as the button for selecting values,
and button 2 (the drag button) for dragging the slider arm to a value. These
definitions also apply to the same buttons on any other pointing device,
such as a joystick.
<P>
The select button and drag button can be used in conjunction with the following
slider components to select slider values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Slider arm
<P>
Moving the pointer over the slider arm, then pressing and holding the select
or drag buttons while moving the pointer, causes the slider arm to move
in the direction the pointer is moving. When the button is released, the
value closest to the slider arm position becomes the selected value.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Slider shaft
<P>
Clicking the select button when the pointer is over the slider shaft causes
the slider arm to move one increment in the direction of the pointer. For
linear sliders, increments are determined by the initial values passed for
the primary scale specified (SLS_PRIMARYSCALE1 or SLS_PRIMARYSCALE2) when
the slider is created.
<P>
Clicking the drag button when the pointer is over the slider shaft causes
the slider arm to move to the pointer's location.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Slider buttons
<P>
Clicking the select button when the pointer is over a slider button causes
the slider arm to move one increment in the direction the arrow on the slider
button is pointing.
<P>
Slider buttons are optional. If used, two slider buttons are available to
the user. The arrows on top of the slider buttons point to opposite ends
of the slider. Both slider buttons are positioned at the same end of the
slider.
<P>
For linear sliders, slider buttons are enabled by specifying the appropriate
SLS_* value when the slider control window is created. For horizontal sliders,
you can specify either SLS_BUTTONSLEFT or SLS_BUTTONSRIGHT. For vertical
sliders, you can specify either SLS_BUTTONSBOTTOM or SLS_BUTTONSTOP. The
default is no slider buttons. If more than one of these style bits is specified,
no slider buttons are enabled.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Detents
<P>
A detent is similar to a tick mark on a linear slider scale because it represents
a value on the scale. However, unlike a tick mark, a detent can be placed
anywhere along the slider scale instead of in specific increments.
<P>
A detent can be selected by moving the pointer over it and pressing the
select button on the pointing device. When this happens, the slider arm
moves to the position on the slider shaft indicated by the detent.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
