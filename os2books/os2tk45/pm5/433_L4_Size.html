<P>
A window's<I> size</I> (width and height) is given in pels, in the range
0 through 65535.  A window can have 0 width and height; however, a window
with 0 width or height is not drawn on the screen, even though it has the
WS_VISIBLE style.
<P>
An application can create very large windows; however, it should check the
size of the screen before enlarging a window size.  One way to choose an
appropriate size is to use the WinGetMaxPosition function to retrieve the
size of the maximized window.  A window that is larger than its maximized
size will be larger than the screen also.
<P>
An application can retrieve the current size of the window by using the
WinQueryWindowRect function.
