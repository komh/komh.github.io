The statement defines the title, identifier, position, and dimensions of
the frame window, as well as the window style. The FRAME statement is most
often used in a WINDOWTEMPLATE statement and, typically, only one FRAME
statement is used. The FRAME statement, in turn, typically contains at least
one WINDOW statement that defines the client window belonging to the frame
window.
<P>
The frame window has no default style. You must use the<I> framectl</I> field
to define additional frame controls, such as a title bar and system menu,
to be created when the frame window is created. If the text field is not
empty, the statement automatically adds a title-bar control to the frame
window, whether or not you specify the FCF_TITLEBAR style. Frame controls
are given default styles and control identifiers, depending on their class.
For example, a title-bar control receives the identifier FID_TITLEBAR.
<P>
The FRAME statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL, DIALOG,
and WINDOW statements. Typically, a FRAME statement contains one WINDOW
statement.
