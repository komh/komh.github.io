<P>
A string resource is a null-terminated character string that has a unique
string identifier. A string resource can be loaded from the executable file
when needed by using the DosGetResource function with the RT_MESSAGE resource
type. RT_MESSAGE resources are bundled together in groups of 16, with any
missing IDs replaced with zero length strings. Each group, or bundle, is
assigned a unique sequential ID. The resource string ID is not necessarily
the same as the ID specified when using DosGetResource. The formula for
calculating the ID of the resource bundle, for use in DosGetResource, is
as follows:
<PRE>bundle ID = ( id / 16) +1,
</PRE>
where id is the string ID assigned in the RC file.
<P>
Thus, bundle 1 contains strings 0 to 15, bundle 2 contains strings 16 to
31, and so on. Once the address of the bundle has been returned by DosGetResource
(using the calculated ID), the buffer can be parsed to locate the particular
string within the bundle. The number of the string is calculated by the
formula:
<PRE>string = id % 16
</PRE>
(string = remainder for id/16).
<P>
The buffer returned consists of the CodePage of the strings in the first
USHORT, followed by the 16 strings in the bundle. The first BYTE of each
string is the length of the string (including the null terminator), followed
by the string and the terminator. A zero length string is represented by
two bytes:  01 (string length) followed by the null terminator.
<P>
You can provide any number of MESSAGETABLE statements in a resource script
file. The compiler treats all the strings from the various MESSAGETABLE
statements as if they belonged to a single statement. This means that no
two strings in a resource script file can have the same string identifier.

<P>
Although the MESSAGETABLE and STRINGTABLE statements are nearly identical,
most applications use the STRINGTABLE statement instead of the MESSAGETABLE
statement to create string resources.
<P>
You can continue a string on multiple lines by terminating the line with
a backslash (\) or by terminating the line with a double quotation mark
(") and then starting the next line with a double quotation mark.
