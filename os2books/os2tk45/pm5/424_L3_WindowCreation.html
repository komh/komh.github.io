<H1>Window Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 426 -->
<P>
Before any thread in an application can create windows, it must:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call WinInitialize to create an anchor block
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call WinCreateMsgQueue to create a message queue
for the thread<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Then, it can create one or more windows by calling one of the window-creation
functions, such as WinCreateWindow.
<P>
The window-creation functions require that the following information be
supplied in some form:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
Every window belongs to a<I> window class</I> that defines that window's
appearance and behavior.  The chief component of the window class is the
<I>window procedure</I>. The window procedure is the function that receives
and processes all messages sent to the window.
<P>
Every window has a<I> style</I>.  The window style specifies aspects of
a window's appearance and behavior that are not specified by the window's
class.  For example, the WC_FRAME class always creates a frame window, but
the FS_BORDER, FS_DLGBORDER, and FS_SIZEBORDER styles determine the style
of a frame window's border.  A few window styles apply to all windows, but
most apply only to windows of specific window classes.  The window procedure
for a given class interprets the style and allows an application to adapt
a window of a given class for a special circumstance.  For example, an application
can give a window the style WS_SYNCPAINT to cause it to be painted immediately
whenever any portion of the window becomes invalid.  Normally, a window
is painted only if there are no messages waiting in the message queue.
<P>
A window can have a text string associated with it.  Typically, the window
text is displayed in the window or in a title bar.  The class of window
determines whether the window displays the text and, if so, where the text
appears within the window.
<P>
Every window except the desktop window and desktop-object window has a<I> parent
window</I>.  The parent provides the coordinate system used to position
the window and also affects aspects of a window's appearance.  For example,
when the parent window is minimized, hidden, or destroyed, the parent's
child windows are minimized, hidden, or destroyed also.
<P>
Every window has a screen position, size, and z-order position.  The<I> screen
position</I> is the location of the window's lower-left corner, relative
to the lower-left corner of its parent window.  A window's size is its width
and height, measured in pels.  A window's<I> z-order position</I> is the
position of the window in the order of overlapping windows.  This viewing
order is oriented along an imaginary axis, the<I> z</I> axis, extending
outward from the screen.  The window at the top of the z-order overlaps
all<I> sibling</I> windows (that is, windows having the same parent window).
 A window at the bottom of the z-order is overlapped by all sibling windows.
 An application sets a window's z-order position by placing it behind a
given sibling window or at the top or bottom of the z-order of the windows.

<P>
A window can own, or be owned by, another window.  The owner-owned relationship
affects how messages are sent between windows, allowing an application to
create combinations of windows that work together.  A window issues messages
about its state to its owner window; the owner window issues messages back
about what action to perform next.
<P>
The<I> window handle</I> is a unique number across the system that is totally
unambiguous-it identifies one particular window in the system and is assigned
by the system.  A<I> window identifier</I> is analogous to a "given" name
in family relationships; the only requirement is that the name be unique
among siblings.
<P>
A window can have class-specific data that further defines how the window
appears and behaves when it is created.  The system passes the class-specific
data to the window procedure, which then<!-- entering slot 427 --> applies
the data to the new window.
