<P>
This table associates the data files that an application creates with the
executable file of the application. When the user selects one of these data
files, the associated application begins executing.
<P>
A file-association table can also associate icons with the data files that
an application creates. The icons are used to identify the data files graphically.
Because a file-association table associates icons by file type, all data
files having the same file type have the same icon.
<P>
You can provide any number of ASSOCTABLE statements in a resource script
file, but each statement must specify a unique assoctable-id value. The
file-association tables are written not only to the resources within your
executable file, but also to the .ASSOC extended attribute. However, only
the last file-association table specified in the resource script file is
actually written to the extended attribute.
