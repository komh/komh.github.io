<H1>Value Set Styles</H1><!-- entering slot 397 -->
<P>
Value set control window styles are set when a value set window is created.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set one of the following styles when creating a value
set control window. You can override these styles by specifying VIA_BITMAP,
VIA_ICON, VIA_TEXT, VIA_RGB, or VIA_COLORINDEX attributes for individual
value set items.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
VS_BITMAP<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> The attribute for each value set item
is set to the VIA_BITMAP value set item attribute, which means the value
set treats each item as a bit map unless otherwise specified. This is the
default.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_COLORINDEX<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> The
attribute for each value set item is set to the VIA_COLORINDEX value set
item attribute, which means the value set treats each item as an index into
the logical color table unless otherwise specified. This style is most often
used when the colors currently available are adequate.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_ICON
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The attribute for each value set item is set to
the VIA_ICON value set item attribute, which means the value set treats
each item as an icon unless otherwise specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_RGB
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The attribute for each value set item is set to
the VIA_RGB value set item attribute, which means the value set treats each
item as a RGB color value unless otherwise specified. This style is most
often used when you need to create new colors.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_TEXT
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The attribute for each value set item is set to
the VIA_TEXT value set item attribute, which means the value set treats
each item as a text string unless otherwise specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Specify
one or more of the following optional window styles, if desired, by using
an OR operator (|) to combine them with the style specified from the preceding
list:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
VS_BORDER<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> The value set draws a thin border around
itself to delineate the control.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_ITEMBORDER<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> The
value set draws a thin border around each item to delineate it from other
items.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The VS_ITEMBORDER style is useful for items that are hard
to see, such as faint colors or patterns.<!-- lm: 0x2 31 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_OWNERDRAW
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The application is notified whenever the background
of the value set window is to be painted.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_RIGHTTOLEFT
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The value set interprets column orientation as right-to-left,
instead of the default left-to-right arrangement. This means columns are
numbered from right-to-left with the rightmost column being 1 and counting
up as you move left. Home is the rightmost column and end is the leftmost
column.
<P>
There is no visible difference between a value set ordered left-to-right
and a value set ordered right-to-left. Therefore, if your application uses
multiple value sets, the ordering of the items should be consistent in each
value set to avoid confusing the user.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The VS_RIGHTTOLEFT style is used on creation of the control.
Changing this style after creation causes unexpected results.<!-- lm: 0x2 31 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> VS_SCALEBITMAPS
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>The value set automatically scales bit maps to the
size of the cell. If this style is not used, each bit map is centered in
its cell. Also, if the cell is smaller than the bit map, the bit map is
clipped to the size of the cell.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
