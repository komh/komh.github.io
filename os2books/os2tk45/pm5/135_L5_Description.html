<P>
The statement defines the position and dimensions of the control within
the parent window, as well as the control style. The CONTROL statement is
most often used in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement.
<P>
Typically, several CONTROL statements are used in each DIALOG statement,
and each CONTROL statement must have a unique<I> id</I> value. The optional
BEGIN and END statements enclose any CONTROL statements that may be given
with the control. CONTROL statements given in this manner represent child
windows belonging to the control created by the CONTROL statement.
<P>
The CONTROL statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL, DIALOG,
and WINDOW statements, but it usually does not contain such statements.
