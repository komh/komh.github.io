<H1>Graphical User Interface Support for Slider Controls</H1><!-- entering slot 371 -->
<P>
This section describes the support the slider control provides for graphical
user interfaces (GUIs). Except where noted, this support conforms to the
guidelines in the<I> SAA CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.
<P>
Since slider values all are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be
selected at a time. Therefore, the only type of selection supported by the
slider control is<I> single selection</I>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If more than one slider window is open, selecting values in
one slider window has no effect on the values selected in any other slider
window. For linear sliders, a black square is drawn in the center of the
slider arm to show which slider control window has the focus.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
An initial value is selected when the slider control is first displayed.
If the application does not provide the initial selection for a linear slider
(using the SLM_SETSLIDERINFO message) to position the slider arm, the value
at the home position is selected automatically. The home position is the
end of the slider that contains the lowest value on the scale.
