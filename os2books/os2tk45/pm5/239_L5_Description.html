<P>
A pointer resource, typically created by using the OS/2 Icon Editor, is
a bit map defining the shape of the mouse pointer on the screen. The POINTER
statement copies the pointer resource from the file specified in the<I> filename
</I>field and adds it to the application's other resources. A pointer resource
can be loaded from the executable file when needed by using the WinLoadPointer
function.
<P>
You can provide any number of POINTER statements in a resource script file,
but each statement must specify a unique pointer-id value.
