<P>
The system creates a window data structure for each window, which includes
extra space that an application can use to store additional data about a
window.  An application specifies the number of extra bytes to allocate
in the WinRegisterClass function.  All windows of the same class have the
same amount of window data space.
<P>
An application can store window data in a window's data structure by using
the WinSetWindowUShort and WinSetWindowULong functions.  It can retrieve
data by using the WinQueryWindowUShort and WinQueryWindowULong functions.
