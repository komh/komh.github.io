<H1>Dog-Eared Tab</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
The page buttons in the old notebook control have been replaced by a dog-eared
tab in the upper-right hand corner of the control. Selecting the area behind
the dog-eared tab causes the next page to be displayed and selecting the
dog-eared tab itself causes the previous page to be displayed. Plus and
minus symbols emphasize the directions the user can travel in the notebook.
A<B> +</B> symbol in the area behind the dog-eared tab indicates the user
can page forward, and a<B> -</B> symbol in the dog-eared tab indicates the
user can page backward. The symbol disappears when there are no more pages
to turn in that direction.
