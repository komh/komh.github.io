<P>
The value set control supports<I> dynamic resizing</I> if the application
sends the WM_SIZE message to a value set window. This means that the value
set control automatically recalculates the size of the items when either
the user or the application changes the size of the value set window.
<P>
If the value set window's size is decreased so that the window is not large
enough to display all of the items the value set contains, the items are
clipped. If scroll bars are desired to allow the clipped information to
be scrolled into view, they must be provided by the application.
