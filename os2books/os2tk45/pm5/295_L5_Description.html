The statement defines the position and dimensions of the window relative
to its parent window, as well as the window-box style. The WINDOW statement
is typically used in a WINDOWTEMPLATE or FRAME statement.
<P>
Usually, only one WINDOW statement is used in a FRAME statement. It defines
the client window belonging to the corresponding frame window. The optional
BEGIN and END keywords enclose any CONTROL statements that are given with
the window. CONTROL statements given in this manner represent child windows
belonging to the window created by the WINDOW statement.
<P>
The WINDOW statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL, DIALOG,
and WINDOW statements. Typically, a WINDOW statement contains one or no
such statements.
