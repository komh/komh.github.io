<H1>Active Window and Focus Window</H1><!-- entering slot 418 -->
<P>
All frame-window ancestors of the input focus window are said to be<I> active</I>,
meaning that the user interacts with them.  The active window usually is
the topmost main window, which is positioned above all other top-level windows
on the screen.  The active window is indicated by some form of highlighting.
 For example, a highlighted title bar shows that a standard frame window
is active; an active dialog window has a highlighted border.  These types
of highlighting ensure that the user can see the window that is accepting
input.
<P>
A main window (or one of its child windows) is activated by using a mouse
or the keyboard.  When a window is activated, it receives a WM_ACTIVATE
message with its first parameter set to TRUE.  When it is deactivated, it
receives a WM_ACTIVATE message with its first parameter set to FALSE.
<P>
The<I> focus window</I> can be the active window or one of its descendant
windows.  The user can change the<I> input focus</I> the same way active
windows are changed-by mouse or keyboard.  However, the application has
more control over the input focus.  For example, in a window containing
several text entry fields, the tab keys can move the input focus from one
input field to another.  A WM_SETFOCUS message is sent to the window procedure
when a window is gaining or losing the input focus.  The WinQueryFocus function
tells the user which window has the input focus.
