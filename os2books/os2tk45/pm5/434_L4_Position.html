<P>
A window's<I> position</I> is defined as the<I> x,y</I> coordinates of its
lower-left corner.  These coordinates, sometimes called<I> window coordinates</I>,
always are relative to the lower-left corner of the parent window.  For
example, a window having the coordinates (10,10) is placed 10 pels to the
right of, and 10 pels up from, the lower-left corner of its parent window.
 Notice, however, that a window can be positioned anywhere in relation to
its parent, but always relative to the parent's lower-left corner.
<P>
Adjusting a window's position can improve drawing performance.  For example,
an application could position a window so that its horizontal position is
a multiple of 8, relative to the screen<I> origin</I> (the lower-left corner
of the screen).  Coordinates that are multiples of 8 correspond to byte
boundaries in the screen-memory bit map.  It is usually faster to start
drawing at a byte boundary.
<P>
By default, the system positions a frame window on a byte boundary; but
an application can override this action by using the FCF_NOBYTEALIGN style
when creating the window.
