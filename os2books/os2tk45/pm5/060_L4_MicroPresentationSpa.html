<P>
The primary advantage of a micro presentation space over a cached-micro
presentation space is that it can be used for printing as well as painting
in a window.  An application that uses a micro presentation space must explicitly
associate it with a device context.  This makes the micro presentation space
useful for painting to a printer, a plotter, or an off-screen memory bit
map.
<P>
A micro presentation space does not support the full set of OS/2 graphics
functions.  Unlike a normal presentation space, a micro presentation space
does not support retained graphics.
<P>
An application that must display graphics or text in a window and print
to a printer or plotter typically maintains two presentation spaces: one
for the window and one for the printing device. The following figure shows
how an application's graphics output can be routed through separate presentation
spaces to produce a screen display and printed copy. An application creates
a micro presentation space by calling the GpiCreatePS function.  A device
context must be supplied at the time the micro presentation space is created.
 An application typically creates a device context and then a presentation
space.  The following code fragment demonstrates this by obtaining a device
context for a window and associating it with a new micro presentation space:

<PRE>
        hdc = WinOpenWindowDC(...);
        hps = GpiCreatePS(..., hdc, ..., GPIA_ASSOC);

</PRE>

<P>
To create a micro presentation space for a device other than the screen,
replace the call to the WinOpenWindowDC function with a call to the DevOpenDC
function, which obtains a device context for a device other than the screen.
 Then the device context that is obtained by this call can be used as an
argument to GpiCreatePS.
<P>
An application typically creates a micro presentation space during initialization
and uses it until termination.  Each time the application receives a WM_PAINT
message, it should pass the handle of the micro presentation space as an
argument to the WinBeginPaint function; this prevents the system from returning
a cached-micro presentation space.  The system modifies the visible region
of the supplied micro presentation space and returns the presentation space
to the application.  This method enables the application to use the same
presentation space for all drawing in a specified window.
<P>
Micro presentation spaces created by using GpiCreatePS should be destroyed
by calling GpiDestroyPS before the application terminates.  Do not call
the WinReleasePS function to release a presentation space obtained by using
GpiCreatePS.  Before terminating, applications must use the DevCloseDC function
to close any device contexts opened using the DevOpenDC function.  No action
is necessary for device contexts obtained using WinOpenWindowDC, because
the system automatically closes these device contexts when destroying the
associated windows.
