<P>
The default shape of the tabs used on notebook divider pages is square.
This setting is specified by the BKS_SQUARETABS style bit. The shape of
the tabs can be square, rounded, or polygonal. The tab text can be drawn
left-justified, right-justified, or centered. Once set, these styles apply
to the major and minor tabs for all pages in the notebook. The location
of the back pages intersection and the major tabs has no effect on the specification
of the tab-shape position. As with the page buttons, the application can
change the default width and height of the major and minor tabs by using
the BKM_SETDIMENSIONS message.
<P>
A notebook tab can contain text, a bitmap, or be owner-drawn. Text is associated
with a tab page by using the BKM_SETTABTEXT message. Notebook tab text is
centered by default or by specifying the BKS_TABTEXTCENTER style when creating
the notebook window. A bitmap is placed on a tab by using the BKM_SETTABBITMAP
message.  Since the bitmap stretches to fill the rectangular area of the
tab, no style bits are needed for bitmap positioning. If neither a BKM_SETTABTEXT
nor a BKM_SETTABBITMAP message is used, the notebook owner is responsible
for drawing the tab when a WM_DRAWITEM message is received for the tab.
