<H1>Three Types of Presentation Spaces</H1><!-- entering slot 58 -->
<P>
All drawing must take place within a presentation space. The operating system
provides three types of presentation spaces for drawing:  normal, micro,
and cached-micro presentation spaces. The<I> normal presentation space</I> provides
the most functionality, allowing access to all the graphics functions of
the operating system and enabling the application to draw to all device
types.  The normal presentation space is more difficult to use than the
other two kinds of presentation spaces and it uses more memory.  It is created
by using the GpiCreatePS function and is destroyed by using the GpiDestroyPS
function.
<P>
The<I> micro presentation space</I> allows access to only a subset of the
operating system graphics functions, but it uses less memory and is faster
than a normal presentation space.  The micro presentation space also enables
the application to draw to all device types.  It is created by using the
GpiCreatePS function and destroyed by using the GpiDestroyPS function.
<P>
The<I> cached-micro presentation space</I> provides the least functionality
of the three kinds of presentation spaces, but it is the most efficient
and easiest to use.  The cached-micro presentation space draws only to the
screen.  It is created and destroyed by using either the WinBeginPaint and
WinEndPaint functions or the WinGetPS and WinReleasePS functions.
<P>
The following sections describe each of the types of presentation spaces,
in detail, and suggest strategies for using each type in an application.
 All three kinds of presentation spaces can be used in a single application.
 Some windows, especially if they never will be printed, are best served
by cached-micro presentation spaces.  Other windows might require the more
flexible services of micro or normal presentation spaces.
