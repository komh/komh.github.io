Messages are a fundamental part of the operating system.  PM applications
use messages to communicate with the operating system and one another.  The
system uses messages to communicate with applications to ensure concurrent
running and sharing of devices.  Typically, a message notifies the receiving
application that an<I> event</I> has occurred.  The operating system identifies
the appropriate application window to receive a message by the window handle
included in the message.  Sources of events that cause messages to be issued
to applications are the user, the operating system, the application, or
another application.
