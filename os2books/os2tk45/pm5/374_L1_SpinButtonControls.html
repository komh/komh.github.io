A<I> spin button</I> control (WC_SPINBUTTON window class) is a visual component
that gives users quick access to a finite set of data by letting them select
from a scrollable ring of choices. Because the user can see only one item
at a time, a spin button should be used only with data that is intuitively
related, such as a list of the months of the year, or an alphabetic list
of cities or states. This chapter explains when and how to use spin buttons
in PM applications.
