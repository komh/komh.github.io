<H1>Parent-Child Relationship</H1><!-- entering slot 412 -->
<P>
Most windows have a<I> parent window</I>. (The exceptions are the desktop
and desktop-object windows, which the system creates at system startup.)
 An application specifies the parent when it creates a window; then, the
system uses the parent to determine where and how to draw any new windows,
as well as when to<I> destroy</I> the windows (free all associated resources
and remove the windows from the screen).
<P>
A<I> child window</I> is drawn relative to its parent.  The coordinates
given to specify the position of a window's lower-left corner are relative
to the lower-left corner of its parent.  For example, a main window (child
of the desktop) is drawn relative to the lower-left corner of the screen
(the desktop window's lower-left corner).
<P>
All main windows are<I> siblings</I> because they share a common parent,
the desktop window.  Because sibling windows can overlap, an application
or a user arranges the windows, one behind another (like a stack of papers
on a desk), in the desired viewing order (called<I> z-order</I>). Z-order
uses the desktop as a reference point for a "three-dimensional" ranking
of the overlapping windows: the topmost window has the highest ranking,
while the window at the bottom of the stack has the lowest ranking.  The
parent of the sibling windows is always at the bottom of the z-order. The
following figure illustrates the hierarchy of such an arrangement.

<P>
Window Hierarchy
<P>
Although PM<I> supports</I> z-order, it does not<I> enforce</I> the expected
appearance unless you specify the CS_CLIPCHILDREN or CS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles.
 No part of a child window ever appears outside the borders of its parent.
 If an application creates a window that is larger than its parent, or positions
a window so that some or all of it extends beyond the borders of the parent,
the extended portion of the child window is not drawn.
<P>
An application can use the WS_CLIPCHILDREN or WS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles to
remove from a window's<I> clipping area</I> (the area in which the window
can paint) the area occupied by its child or sibling windows.  For example,
an application can use these styles to prevent a window from painting over
a child or sibling window containing a complex graphic that would be time-consuming
to redraw.
<P>
When a window is minimized, hidden, or destroyed, all of its children are
hidden, minimized, or destroyed as well.  The order of destruction is always
such that every window is destroyed before its parent.  The window-destruction
sequence starts at the bottom of descendancy so that all related windows
can be cleaned up; the last one to go is the window you asked to be destroyed.
 The final PM task in a window-destruction sequence is to send a WM_DESTROY
message to that window, so it has one last chance to release any resources
it has allocated and may still be holding.
<P>
Every window has only one parent, but can have any number of children. window
in this tree is said to be a<I> descendant</I> of any window appearing above
it in the branch, and an<I><!-- entering slot 413 --> ancestor</I> of any
window appearing below it.  There are two special cases, of course: the
window immediately above is called the window's<I> parent</I>, and any window
immediately below it is called its<I> child</I>.  An application can change
a window's parent window at any time by using the WinSetParent function.
 Changing the parent window also changes where and how the child window
is drawn.  The system displays the child within the borders of the new parent
and draws the window according to the styles specified for the new parent.
