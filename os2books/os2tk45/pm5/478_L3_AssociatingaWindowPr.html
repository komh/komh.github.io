<H1>Associating a Window Procedure with a Window Class</H1><!-- entering slot 484 -->
<P>
To associate a window procedure with a window class, an application must
pass a pointer to that window procedure to the WinRegisterClass function.
 Once an application has registered the window procedure, the procedure
automatically is associated with each new window created with that class.

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to associate the window procedure
in the previous example with a window class:
<P>

<PRE>    HAB hab;
    CHAR szClientClass[] = "My Window Class";

    WinRegisterClass(hab,      /* Anchor-block handle  */
        szClientClass,         /* Class name           */
        ClientWndProc,         /* Pointer to procedure */
        CS_SIZEREDRAW,         /* Class style          */
        0);                    /* Window data          */

</PRE>
