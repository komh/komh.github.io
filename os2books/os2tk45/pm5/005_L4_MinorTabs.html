<P>
Minor tabs are specified using the BKA_MINOR attribute. Minor tabs always
are placed perpendicular to the major tabs, based on the intersection of
the back pages and the major tab placement. Only one major or minor tab
attribute can be specified for each notebook page. Minor tabs are displayed
only if the associated major tab page is selected or if the notebook has
no major tab pages.
<P>
The placement of the minor tabs depends entirely on the placement of the
back pages and major tabs, respectively. The minor tabs always are located
on the recessed page side that has no major tabs.
