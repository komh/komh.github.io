<H1>Window Visibility</H1><!-- entering slot 445 -->
<P>
A window that is a descendant of the desktop window can be either visible
or invisible.  The system displays a visible window on the screen.  It hides
an invisible window by not drawing it.  If a window is visible, the user
can supply input to the window and view the window's output.  If a window
is invisible, the window, in effect, is disabled.  An invisible window can
process messages from the system or from other windows, but it cannot process
user input or display output.  An application sets a window's visibility
state when it creates the window.  Later, a user or the application can
change the visibility state.
<P>
The visible region of a window is the position clipped by any overlapping
windows.  These overlapping windows can be child windows or other main windows
in the system.  The visible region is defined by a set of one or more rectangles,
as shown in the following figure.

Visible Region for Window A
<P>
A window is visible if the WS_VISIBLE style is set for the window.  By default,
the WinCreateWindow function creates invisible windows unless the application
specifies WS_VISIBLE.  The application often hides a window to keep its
operational details from the user.  For example, an application can keep
a new window invisible while it customizes the window's appearance.  An
application can determine whether a window has the WS_VISIBLE style by using
the WinIsWindowVisible function.
<P>
Even if a window has the WS_VISIBLE style, the user might not be able to
see the window on the screen because other windows completely overlap it,
or it might have been moved beyond the edge of its parent.  A visible window
is subject to the clipping rules established by its parent-child relationship.
 If the window's parent window is not visible, the window will not be visible.
 Because a child window is drawn relative to its parent's lower-left corner,
if the parent window is moved beyond the edge of the screen, the child window
also will be moved.  In other words, if a user moves the parent window containing
the child window far enough off the edge of the screen, the user will not
be able to see the child window, even though the child window and its parent
window have the WS_VISIBLE style.  To determine whether the user actually
can see a window, an application can use the WinIsWindowShowing function.
