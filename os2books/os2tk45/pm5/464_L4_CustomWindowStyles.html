<P>
An application that registers a window class also can support its own set
of styles for windows of that class.  Standard window styles-for example,
WS_VISIBLE and WS_SYNCPAINT-still apply to these windows.  A window style
is a 32-bit integer, and only the high 16 bits are used for the standard
window styles; an application can use the low 16 bits for custom styles
specific to a window class.
<P>
The operating system has unique window styles for all preregistered window
classes.  Styles such as FS_BORDER and BS_PUSHBUTTON are processed by the
window procedure for the corresponding class.  This means that an application
can build the support for its own window styles into the window procedure
for its private class.  A window style designed for one window class will
not work with another window class.
