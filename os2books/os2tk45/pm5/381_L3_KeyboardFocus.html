<P>
A static control never accepts the keyboard focus. When a static control
receives a WM_SETFOCUS message, or when a user clicks the static control,
the system advances the focus to the next sibling window that is not a static
control. If the control has no siblings, the system gives the focus to the
owner of the static control.
