<P>
To the left of the dog-eared tab is the status line, which enables the application
to provide information to the user about the page being displayed.  The
notebook does not supply any default text for this line, thus the application
is responsible for associating a text string with the status line on each
page of the notebook.
<P>
The status line is always next to the dog-eared tab, thus the BKS_STATUSTEXTLEFT,
BKS_STATUSTEXTRIGHT, and BKS_STATUSTEXTMIDDLE styles are ignored.
