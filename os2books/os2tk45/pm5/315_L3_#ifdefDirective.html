<P>
The #ifdef directive controls conditional compilation of the resource file
by checking the specified name. If the name has been defined by using a
define directive or by using the -d command-line option of rc, #ifdef directs
the compiler to continue with the statement immediately after the #ifdef
directive. If the name has not been defined, #ifdef directs the compiler
to skip all statements up to the next #endif directive.
