<H1>Arranging Value Set Items</H1><!-- entering slot 401 -->
<P>
The application defines the arrangement of value set items; they can be
arranged in one or more rows, columns, or both. Items are placed from left
to right in rows and from top to bottom in columns. The application can
change the number of rows and columns at any time.
<P>
The number of items that can be displayed depends on the number of items
that fit into the spaces provided by the defined rows and columns. If the
number of items exceeds the number of spaces, the excess items are not displayed.

<P>
You can change the composition of a value set by specifying new items. The
new items either can be added to the value set or can replace existing items.
