<P>
A user can use a pointing device to select value set items. The<I> SAA CUA
Guide to User Interface Design</I> defines mouse button 1, the<I> select
</I>button, to be used for selecting items. This definition also applies
to the same button on any other pointing device.
<P>
An item can be selected by moving the pointer of the pointing device to
the item and clicking the select button. When this happens, a black box
is drawn around the item to show that it has been selected. The black box
is called<I> selected-state emphasis</I>. In addition, the selection cursor
is drawn inside the black box.
