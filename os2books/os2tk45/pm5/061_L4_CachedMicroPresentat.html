<H1>Cached-Micro Presentation Spaces</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
The cached-micro presentation space provides the simplest and most efficient
drawing environment.  It can be used only for drawing on the screen, typically
in the context of a window.  It is most appropriate for application tasks
that require simple window-drawing functions that will not be printed.  Cached-micro
presentation spaces do not support retained graphics.
<P>
After an application draws to a cached-micro presentation space, the drawing
commands are routed through an implied device context to the current display.
 The application does not require information about the actual device context,
because the device context is assumed to be the display.  This process makes
cached-micro presentation spaces easy for applications to use. The following
code fragment illustrates this process:
<P>

<PRE>       HPS    hps;

            case WM_PAINT:
                hps = WinBeginPaint(hwnd,NULL,NULL);

                /*
                 * Use PS.
                 */

                WinEndPaint (hps);

</PRE>

<P>
              or
<P>

<PRE>        HPS    hps;

            case WM_PAINT:

                 hps = WinGetPS(hwnd);

                 /*
                 * Use PS.
                 */

                 WinReleasePS(hps);

</PRE>

<P>
There are two common strategies for using cached-micro presentation spaces
in an application. The simplest strategy is to call the WinBeginPaint function
during the WM_PAINT message, use the resulting cached-micro presentation
space to draw in the window, then return the presentation space to the system
by calling the WinEndPaint function.  By using this method, the application
interacts with the presentation space only when drawing in the presentation
space.  This method is most appropriate for simple drawing.  A disadvantage
of this method is that the application must set up any special attributes
for the presentation space, such as line color and font, each time a new
presentation space is obtained.
<P>
A second strategy is for the application to allocate a cached-micro presentation
space during initialization, by calling the WinGetPS function and saving
the resulting presentation-space handle in a static variable.  Then the
application can set attributes in the presentation space that exist for
the life of the program.  The presentation-space handle can be used as an
argument to the WinBeginPaint function each time the window gets a WM_PAINT
message; the system modifies the visible region and returns the presentation
space to the application with its attributes intact. This strategy is appropriate
for applications that need to customize their window-drawing attributes.
A presentation space that is obtained by calling the WinGetPS function must
be released by calling WinReleasePS when the application has finished using
it, typically during program termination.  A presentation space that is
obtained by calling WinBeginPaint must be released by calling WinEndPaint,
typically as the last part of processing a WM_PAINT message.
