<P>
A<I> private window class</I> is any class registered within an application.
 An application registers a private class by calling the WinRegisterClass
function.  A private class cannot be shared with other applications.  When
an application terminates, the system removes any data associated with the
application's private window classes.
<P>
An application can register a private class anytime but, typically, does
so as part of application initialization.  To register a private class during
application initialization, the application also must call WinInitialize
and, usually, WinCreateMsgQueue before class registration.
<P>
An application cannot de-register a private window class; it remains registered
and available until the application terminates.
<P>
When an application registers a private window class, it must supply the
following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Class name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Class styles<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window procedure<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window data size<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
