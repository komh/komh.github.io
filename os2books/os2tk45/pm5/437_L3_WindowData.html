<H1>Window Data</H1><!-- entering slot 442 -->
<P>
Every window has an associated data structure. The window data structure
contains all the information specified for the window at the time it was
created and any additional information supplied for the window since that
time.  Although the exact size and meaning of the information in the window
data structure are private to the system, an application can access any
of the following data items via system-provided functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pointer to window-instance data structure<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pointer to window procedure<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Parent-window handle<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Owner-window handle<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Handle of first child window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Handle of next sibling window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window size and position (expressed as a rectangle)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window style<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Window identifier<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Update-region handle<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Message-queue handle<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application can examine and modify this data by using functions such
as WinQueryWindowUShort and WinSetWindowUShort. These functions let an application
access data that is stored as 16-bit integers.  Other functions let an application
access data containing 32-bit integers and pointers.  Several functions
indirectly affect the data items in the window data structure.  For example,
the WinSubclassWindow function replaces the window-procedure pointer, and
the WinSetWindowPos function changes the size and position of the window.

<P>
An application can extend the number of available data items in the window
data structure by specifying a count of extra bytes when it registers the
corresponding window class.  Then, the window procedure can use these bytes
to store information about the window.  The WinQueryWindowUShort and WinSetWindowUShort
functions give direct access to the extra bytes.
<P>
It generally is not a good idea to use direct storage in the window data.
 It is better to allocate a data structure dynamically and set a pointer
to that data structure in the window words.  This provides two advantages:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Most importantly, it is a symbolic way of referencing
the data structure.  It is very easy to make mistakes and provide the wrong
offsets to WinQueryWindowUShort and so forth.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You now can add and remove fields without cross
dependencies because you now use<I> symbolic</I> references; whereas, when
you use the technique of putting window words directly in the window data
structure, you have to account for changed offsets.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
