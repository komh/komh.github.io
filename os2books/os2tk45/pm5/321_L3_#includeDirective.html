<H1>#include Directive</H1><!-- entering slot 321 -->
<P>
The #include directive causes RC to process the file specified in the<I> filename
</I>field. This file should be a header file that defines the constants
used in the resource script file. Only the define directives in the specified
file are processed. All other statements are ignored.
<P>
The<I> filename</I> field is handled as a C string. Therefore, you must
include two backslashes (\\) wherever one is required in the path. (As an
alternative, you can use a single forward slash (/) instead of two backslashes.)
