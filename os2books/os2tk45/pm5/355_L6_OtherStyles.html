If SLS_SNAPTOINCREMENT is specified and the slider arm is moved to a position
between two values on the slider scale, it is positioned on the nearest
value and redrawn at that position. If this style is not specified, the
slider arm remains at the position to which it is moved.
<BR>

<P>
SLS_READONLY creates a read-only slider. This means the user cannot interact
with the slider. It is simply used as to present a quantity to the user,
such as the percentage of completion of an ongoing task. Visual differences
for a read-only slider include a narrow slider arm, no slider buttons, and
no detents.
<P>
The SLS_RIBBONSTRIP style allows movement of the slider arm to cause the
slider shaft between home position and the slider arm to be filled with
a color value that is different from the slider shaft color, similar to
mercury in a thermometer.
<P>
If SLS_OWNERDRAW is specified, the application is notified whenever the
slider shaft, the ribbon strip, the slider arm, and the slider background
are to be drawn.
