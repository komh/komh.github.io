<P>
The statement has three basic forms to permit specifying a menu or specifying
data in words or characters. The data can be in any format, because only
your window procedure will use it. The window procedure of the dialog box,
window, or control receives this data when the item is created. It is up
to the window procedure to process the data.
<P>
CTLDATA is often used to supply data that controls the subsequent operation
of the custom window. For example, the CTLDATA statement may contain extended
style bits - that is, style bits designed specifically for your customized
window.
<P>
You should reserve the CTLDATA statement for window classes that you create
yourself.
