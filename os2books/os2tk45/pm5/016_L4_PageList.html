<P>
The page list is a popup menu that lists all the pages in the notebook.
To display the page list, position the pointer on a notebook tab or border
and click mouse button 2. If a major tab in the page list has more than
one page associated with it, its pages are placed in a submenu.
<P>
The text displayed in the page list for a given page is determined by the
minor tab, major tab, and status text associated with the page. If a minor
tab is associated with a page, its text is used. If only a major tab is
associated with a page, the major tab text is used.  If no tab is associated
with the page, the status line text is used for the page list.  If no status
text is provided for the page, the page list entry is left blank.
