<H1>Status Line</H1><!-- entering slot 6 -->
<P>
To the left of the page buttons in the default old notebook style setting
is the<I> status line</I>, which enables the application to provide information
to the user about the page currently displayed. The notebook does not supply
any default text for the status line.
<P>
The application is responsible for associating a text string with the status
line of each page on which a text string is to be displayed.  The status
line can be used in addition to the major and minor tabs to provide the
user with additional information on a particular page in the notebook.  It
is commonly used in large notebooks to assist the user in navigating, by
indicating that this page is<I> page 1 of n</I>.
<P>
The status text is drawn left-justified by default, but it can be drawn
centered or right-justified. The same status text justification applies
to all pages in the notebook. This setting is specified by the BKS_STATUSTEXTLEFT
style bit. The location of the back pages intersection and the major tabs
has no effect on the specification of the status line position. This style
bit can be set for the entire notebook.
