<H1>International Standards Organization (ISO) 9241</H1><!-- entering slot 509 -->
<P>
ISO 9241 is an international standard covering health and safety in the
work place for users of visual display terminals. Part 3 of this standard
covers clarity and legibility of text displayed on computer screens; it
places requirements on minimum sizes and luminance contrast. The presence
of the FM_SEL_ISO9241_TESTED flag in the<A><!-- external link: 1D F8 C7 39 --> FONTMETRICS
</A>structure indicates that the font has been tested for ISO compliance.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> While the fonts were primarily tested for meeting the ISO
standard, they have also been designed to meet the German standard DIN 66
234. Where the two standards differ, the fonts have been designed to meet
the stricter requirement.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The FM_ISO_xxx flags indicate the results of the test on the three IBM displays
that conform to the standard. These are the IBM 9515, 9517, and 9518 color
displays at the supported resolutions of 640 x 480 and 1024 x 768. To determine
whether a non-IBM display complies with ISO 9241, contact the manufacturer.
The current display type can be established using VioGetConfig.
<P>
In order for applications to meet the standard, they have to ensure that
they use only fonts that have been tested and passed. You can determine
this by examining the new FM_SEL_ISO9241_TESTED flag in the<I> fsSelection
</I>parameter in the<A><!-- external link: 1D F8 C7 39 --> FONTMETRICS</A> structure,
the FM_ISO_xxx flags and the<I> sXDeviceRes</I> and<I> sYDeviceRes</I> fields
in the structure.
