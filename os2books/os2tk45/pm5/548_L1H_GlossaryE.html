code. A coded character set consisting of 8-bit coded characters (9 bits
including parity check), used for information interchange among data processing
systems, data communications systems, and associated equipment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Pertaining to an event semaphore that is posted
then reset before a waiting thread gets a chance to run. The semaphore is
considered to be posted for the rest of that thread's waiting period; the
thread does not have to wait for the semaphore to be posted again.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Hiding
an object's implementation, that is, its private, internal data and methods.
Private variables and methods are accessible only to the object that contains
them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> entry field</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> In
SAA Common User Access architecture, an area where a user types information.
Its boundaries are usually indicated. See also<I> selection field</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> A defined panel type containing one
or more entry fields and protected information such as headings, prompts,
and explanatory text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> entry-field control</B>
-<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> The component of a user interface that provides
the means by which the application receives data entered by the user in
an entry field. When it has the input focus, the entry field displays a
flashing pointer at the position where the next typed character will go.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>environment segment</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> The
list of environment variables and their values for a process.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

value of environment variables.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> environment variables
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Variables that describe the execution environment
of a process. These variables are named by the operating system or by the
application. Environment variables named by the operating system are PATH,
DPATH, INCLUDE, INIT, LIB, PROMPT, and TEMP. The values of environment variables
are defined by the user in the CONFIG.SYS file, or by using the SET command
at the OS/2 command prompt.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL><B>event semaphore</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> A
semaphore that enables a thread to signal a waiting thread or threads that
an event has occurred or that a task has been completed. The waiting threads
can then perform an action that is dependent on the completion of the signaled
event.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> exception</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> An
abnormal condition such as an I/O error encountered in processing a data
set or a file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

threads within the same process.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> executable file
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> (1) A file that contains programs or commands
