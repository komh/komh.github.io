<P>
The value set control supports<I> automatic selection</I>, which means that
an available item is selected when the selection cursor is moved to that
item. The item is given selected-state emphasis as soon as the selection
cursor is moved to it. No further action, such as pressing the spacebar,
is required. The same black box and dotted outline are used, for selected-state
emphasis and the selection cursor respectively, as when an item is selected
with a pointing device.
<P>
A user can navigate to and select an item by using either the navigation
keys or mnemonic selection to move the selection cursor to the item, as
described in the following list:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Items can be selected using the Up, Down, Left, and
Right Arrow keys to move the selection cursor from one item to another.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Home and End keys can be used to select the leftmost
and rightmost items, respectively, in the current row. If the Ctrl key is
pressed in combination with the Home or End key, the item in the top row
and the leftmost column, or the item in the bottom row and the rightmost
column, respectively, is selected.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The preceding description assumes that the current style of
the value set window is left-to-right. However, if the VS_RIGHTTOLEFT style
bit is set, the directions described for the Home, End, Ctrl+Home, and Ctrl+End
keys in the preceding paragraph are reversed.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
PgUp key can be used to select the item in the top row that is directly
above the current position of the selection cursor. The PgDn key can be
used to select the item in the bottom row that is directly below the current
position of the selection cursor. If the space in the top or bottom row
directly above or below the current cursor position is blank, the cursor
moves to the blank space.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Another
keyboard method of selecting items is<I> mnemonic selection</I>. A user
performs mnemonic selection by pressing a character key that corresponds
to an underlined character. Coding a tilde (~) before a text character in
the item causes that character to be underlined and activates it as a mnemonic
selection character. When this happens, the selection cursor is moved to
the item that contains the underlined character, and that item is selected.
