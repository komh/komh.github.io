<H1>System-Modal Window</H1><!-- entering slot 425 -->
<P>
An application can designate a<I> system-modal window</I>: a window that
receives all keyboard and mouse input, effectively disabling all other windows.
 The user must respond to the system-modal window before continuing work
in other windows.  An application sets and clears the system-modal window
by using the WinSetSysModalWindow function.
<P>
Because system-modal windows have absolute control of input, you must be
careful when using them in your applications.  Ideally, an application uses
a system-modal window only when there is danger of losing data if the user
does not respond to a problem immediately.
<P>
Although an application can destroy a system-modal window, the new active
window then becomes a system-modal window.  An application can make another
window active while the first system-modal window exists.  But again, the
new active window will become the system-modal window.  In general, once
a system-modal window is set, it continues to exist in the PM session until
the application explicitly clears it.
