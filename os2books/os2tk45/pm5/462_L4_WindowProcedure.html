<H1>Window Procedure</H1><!-- entering slot 467 -->
<P>
The window procedure for a window class processes all messages sent or posted
to all windows of that class.  It is the chief component of the window class
because it controls the appearance and behavior of each window created with
the class.  Window procedures are shared by all windows of a class, so an
application must ensure that no conflicts arise when two windows of the
same class attempt to access the same global data.  In other words, the
window procedure must protect global data and other shared resources.
