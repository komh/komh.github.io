<P>
This notebook control component simulates a real notebook but improves on
it by overcoming a notebook's natural limitations. A user can select and
display pages by using a pointing device or the keyboard.
<P>
The notebook can be customized to meet varying application requirements,
while providing a user interface component that can be used easily to develop
products that conform to the Common User Access (CUA) user interface guidelines.
The application can specify different colors, sizes, and orientations for
its notebooks and whether an old notebook or a new style notebook is desired,
but the underlying function of the control remains the same.
