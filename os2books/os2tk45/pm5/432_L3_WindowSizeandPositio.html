<P>
A window's size and position can be expressed as a bounding rectangle, given
in coordinates relative to its parent.  An application specifies the window's
initial size and position when creating the window.
<P>
To use the system-default values for the initial size and position of a
frame window, an application can specify the FCF_SHELLPOSITION frame-creation
flag.  The application can change a window's size and position at any time.

<P>
<B>Note: </B>
<P>
The default coordinate system for a window specifies that the point (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the window, with coordinates increasing as
they go upward and to the right.
<P>
A window can be positioned anywhere in relation to its parent.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
