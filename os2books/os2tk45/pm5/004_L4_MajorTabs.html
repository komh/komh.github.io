<H1>Major Tabs</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
<I>Major</I> and<I> minor</I> tabs are used to organize related pages into
sections. Minor tabs define subsections within major tab sections. The content
of each section has a common theme, which is represented to the user by
a tabbed divider that is similar to a tabbed page in a notebook, an address
book, or a large dictionary.
<P>
The BKS_MAJORTABRIGHT style bit specifies that major tabs are to be placed
on the right side of the notebook. This is the default major tab placement
when the back pages intersect at the bottom-right corner of the notebook.
The binding is located on the left, because it is always located on the
opposite side of the notebook from the major tabs.
<P>
The placement of the major tabs is limited to one of the two edges on which
there are recessed pages. For example, if the application specifies the
back pages intersection at the bottom-right corner (BKS_BACKPAGESBR, the
default), the major tabs can be placed on either the bottom edge (BKS_MAJORTABBOTTOM)
or the right edge (BKS_MAJORTABRIGHT) of the notebook. In this situation,
if the application specifies that major tabs are to be placed on the left
or top edges of the notebook, the notebook control places them on the right
edge anyway-the default placement for back pages intersecting at the bottom-right
corner.
<P>
When major tabs are defined at the creation of the notebook they are not
displayed on screen. Major tab attributes only show at the time a page is
inserted into the notebook. This is done by specifying the BKA_MAJOR attribute
in the BKM_INSERTPAGE message.
