<H1>Enumerating Top-Level Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 455 -->
<P>
An application can enumerate all top-level windows in the system by using
the WinBeginEnumWindows and WinGetNextWindow functions.  An application
also can create a list of all child windows for a given parent window using
WinBeginEnumWindows.  This list contains the window handles of immediate
child windows.  By using WinGetNextWindow, the application then can retrieve
the window handles, one at a time, from the list.  When the application
has finished using the list, it must release the list with the WinEndEnumWindows
function.
<P>
The code fragment in the following figure shows how to enumerate all top-level
windows (all immediate child windows of the desktop window):
<PRE>
    HWND hwndTop;
    HENUM henum;

    /* Enumerate all top-level windows.           */

    henum = WinBeginEnumWindows(HWND_DESKTOP);

    /* Loop through all enumerated windows.       */
    while (hwndTop = WinGetNextWindow(henum)) {
        .
        . /* Perform desired task on each window. */
        .
    }

    WinEndEnumWindows(henum);

</PRE>
