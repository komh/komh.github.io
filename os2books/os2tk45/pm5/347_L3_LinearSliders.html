<P>
Typically, linear sliders are used to easily set values that have familiar
increments, such as feet, inches, degrees, and decibels. They also can be
used for other purposes when immediate feedback is required, such as blending
colors or showing a task's percentage of completion. For example, an application
might let a user mix and match color shades by moving a slider arm, or a
read-only slider could show how much of a task is complete by filling in
the slider shaft as the task progresses. These are just a few examples of
the ways in which sliders can be used.
<P>
The<I> slider arm</I> shows the value currently set by its position on the
<I>slider shaft</I>. The user selects slider values by changing the location
of the slider arm.
<P>
A<I> tick mark</I> indicates an incremental value in a slider scale. A<I> detent</I>,
which is similar to a tick mark, also represents a value on the scale. However,
a detent can be placed anywhere along the slider scale, rather than only
in specific increments, and can be selected.
<P>
The appearance of a slider and the user interaction with a slider are similar
to that of a scroll bar. However, these two controls are not interchangeable
because each has a unique purpose. A scroll bar scrolls information into
view that is outside a window's work area, while the slider is used to set,
display, or modify that information, whether it is in or out of the work
area.
<P>
Although linear sliders usually use values that have familiar increments,
text also can be used. However, if the text is too long it can overlap the
text displayed on the next tick mark or detent. Also, if the text on the
far edge markers is too long, some of the text will not be displayed on
screen. To prevent this use one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Smaller font<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Shorter text values<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Static controls<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The slider can be customized to meet varying application requirements, while
providing a user interface component that can be used easily to develop
products that conform to the Systems Application Architecture (SAA) Common
User Access (CUA) user interface guidelines. The application can specify
different scales, sizes, and orientations for its sliders, but the underlying
function of the control remains the same. For a complete description of
CUA sliders, refer to the<I> SAA CUA Guide to User Interface Design</I> and
the<I> SAA CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.
