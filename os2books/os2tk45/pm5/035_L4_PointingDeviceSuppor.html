<H1>Pointing Device Support</H1><!-- entering slot 35 -->
<P>
A user can use a pointing device to display notebook pages or tabs by selecting
the notebook components described in the following list. The CUA guidelines
define mouse button 1 (the select button) to be used for selecting these
components. This definition also applies to the same button on any other
pointing device a user might have.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Selecting tabs using a pointing device
<P>
A tab can be selected to bring a page that has a major or minor tab attribute
to the top of the notebook. The<I> selection cursor</I>, a dotted outline,
is drawn inside the tab's border to indicate the selected tab. In addition,
the selected tab is given the same background color as the notebook page
area. The color of the other tabs is specified in the BKM_SETNOTEBOOKCOLORS
message. This helps the user distinguish the selected tab from the other
tabs if different colors are used.
<P>
Because all tabs are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be selected
at a time. Therefore, the only type of selection supported by the notebook
control is<I> single selection</I>. This selection type conforms to the
guidelines in the<I> SAA CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.
<P>
If the user moves the pointing device to a place in the notebook page window
that can accept a cursor, such as an entry field, check box, or radio button,
and presses the select button, the selection cursor is removed from the
tab it is on and is displayed in the notebook page window. The selection
cursor never can be displayed both on a tab and in the notebook page window
at the same time.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Selecting page buttons using a pointing device
<P>
A forward or backward<I> page button</I> can be selected to display the
next or previous page, respectively, one at a time. The arrow pointing to
the right is the forward page button, and the arrow pointing to the left
is the backward page button. When the selection of a page button brings
a page that has a major or minor tab to the top of the notebook, the selection
cursor is drawn inside that tab's border.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Selecting tab scroll buttons using a pointing device

<P>
A user can decrease the size of a notebook window so that some of the available
notebook tabs cannot be displayed. When this happens, the notebook control
automatically draws<I> tab scroll buttons</I> at the corners of the notebook
side or sides to notify the user that more tabs are available.
<P>
Tab scroll buttons have another purpose: to give the user the means to scroll
into view, one at a time, the tabs that are not displayed. The user does
this by selecting a forward or backward tab scroll button, which causes
the next tab to scroll into view, but does not change the location of the
selection cursor. Once the tab is in view, the user can display that tab's
page by selecting the tab.
<P>
A maximum of four tab scroll buttons can be displayed: two for the major
tab side and two for the minor tab side.
<P>
When the first tab in the notebook is displayed, the backward tab scroll
button is deactivated. Unavailable-state emphasis is applied to it to show
that no more tabs can be scrolled into view by using the backward tab scroll
button. Unavailable-state emphasis is applied to the forward tab scroll
button if the last tab in the notebook is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
