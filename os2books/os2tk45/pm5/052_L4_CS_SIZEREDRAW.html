A window with this class style receives a WM_PAINT message; the window is
completely invalidated whenever it is resized, even if it is made smaller.
 (Typically, only the uncovered area of a window is invalidated when a window
is resized.)  This class style is useful when an application scales graphics
to fill the current window.
