<P>
The initialization file contains country information relating to date, time,
and numeric formats.  It does not contain code-page information; this is
obtained from the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
Applications start with the default code page. The default code page is
set when the operating system is installed. It can be changed subsequently
either by reinstalling the operating system or by editing the COUNTRY statement
in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
A GPI presentation space inherits the code page of the process that created
it. The code page changes only when the process calls GpiSetCp
<P>
See the printed version of the<I><I> Presentation Manager Programming Reference
</I>for the ASCII and EBCDIC versions of the code pages.
