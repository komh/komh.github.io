<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 40 --> PCSZ</A> data type
is defined in the C++ header files included with this product. The use of
the "const" keyword is not necessarily specific to C++. Certain C compilers
support it as well.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
If a function takes as a parameter a string that is not changed by the function,
the string parameter can be declared as a "const" string, or a<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 FC --> PCSZ</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 40 -->PCSZ</A> is defined in the C++ header
files as a "const" pointer to a NULL-delimited string. The "const" means
that the function will not change the contents of the string.
<P>
Declaring the parameter as<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C4 40 --> PCSZ</A> informs
the C++ compiler that the function will not change the string. Therefore,
the compiler simply passes a pointer to the string in the function parameter
list. If the parameter is declared as a normal<A><!-- external link: 1D 94 C4 44 --> PSZ
</A>(not "const"), the compiler assumes that the function might change the
string. Under these circumstances the compiler will add code to make a copy
of the string then pass a pointer to the copy, rather than pass a pointer
to the original string.
<P>
A smaller, faster executable is often produced if the data item passed in
a parameter list is declared as "const".
<P>
If the data item is declared as "const" then it must not be changed by the
function.
