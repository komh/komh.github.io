<H1>Addressing Elements in Arrays</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
Constants defining array elements are given values that are zero-based in
C; that is, the numbering of the array elements starts at zero, not one.

<P>
For example, in the DevQueryCaps function, the sixth element of the<I> alArray
</I>parameter is CAPS_HEIGHT, which is equated to 5.
<P>
Count parameters related to such arrays always mean the actual number of
elements available; therefore, again using the DevQueryCaps function as
an example, if all elements up to and including CAPS_HEIGHT are provided
for,<I> lCount</I> could be set to (CAPS_HEIGHT+1).
<P>
In functions for which the starting array element can be specified, this
is always zero-based, and so the C element number constants can be used
directly. For example, to start with the CAPS_HEIGHT element, the DevQueryCaps
parameter can be set to CAPS_HEIGHT.
