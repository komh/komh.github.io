<P>
Before you begin playing the disc, you may want to set the audio channels.
Most videodisc players have two channels for audio. On some videodisc players,
the channels are used to produce a stereo effect.  Other videodisc players
allow you to turn one of the channels off, based on a selection by the user.
This feature is useful for offering the user a choice of language, a level
of instruction, and so forth.
<P>
Most videodisc players allow you to set the volume off (zero) or on (greater
than zero) but do not offer a range of values for volume.

You can set the speed format to frames-per-second or a percentage of the
normal rate.  The default for the speed format is frames-per-second, and
the default for the time format is frames.
<P>
Most videodisc players have an on-screen display that you can set on or
off. The display is a counter that keeps track of your position. The on-screen
display is useful for debugging an application-for example, an interactive
course. The display shows you where you are in relation to where you may
want to be.
