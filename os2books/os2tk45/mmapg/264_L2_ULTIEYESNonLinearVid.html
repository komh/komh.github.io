<H1>ULTIEYES - Non-Linear Video Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 280 -->
<P>
The Non-Linear Video Sample (ULITEYES) demonstrates the use of non-linear
video by displaying segments from a movie clip in response to input from
the mouse. Whenever the mouse changes position, ULTIEYES calculates the
angle of the mouse pointer to the center of the ULTIEYES video window. It
then displays a frame from the movie ULTIEYES.AVI that corresponds to the
position of the mouse pointer. As the mouse pointer is moved around the
desk top, the eyes shown in the video window appear to follow the mouse.
The movie file also contains segments of the eyes winking and blinking.
ULTIEYES shows these segments when it detects a mouse button 1 click on
the left side, center or right side of the video window.
