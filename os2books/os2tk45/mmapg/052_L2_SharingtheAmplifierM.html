<H1>Sharing the Amplifier-Mixer Device</H1><!-- entering slot 60 -->
<P>
Because many components of OS/2 multimedia utilize the amplifier-mixer device,
it is typically opened<I> shareable</I> so that several devices can use
the ampmix device simultaneously, or serially, in an application-window-focus
driven sharing scheme. The Media Device Manager (MDM) is responsible for
allocating the resources of the underlying hardware correctly and informs
an application with the MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message whenever use of the ampmix
device is gained or lost.
<P>
When other media devices in an application use the ampmix device, the amplifier-mixer
becomes a source of contention, depending on the capabilities of the underlying
audio adapter.  For example, the IBM M-Audio adapter supports the simultaneous
playback of two mono 22 kHz PCM waveforms.  However, if a third waveform
is started, one of the previous two waveforms must be suspended.  The application
that opened the waveform audio (waveaudio) device receives a MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
message with an event of MCI_LOSING_USE. Following completion of the third
waveform, the second waveform is automatically restored and can then play
to completion.  See <A HREF="031_L2_DeviceSharingByAppli.html">Device Sharing
By Applications</A> for information on device sharing.
<P>
The OS/2 multimedia system manages all device sharing, and informs the application
when the device is temporarily unavailable.
