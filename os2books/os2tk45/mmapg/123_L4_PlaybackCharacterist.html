<P>
While Ultimotion is a playback-time scalable-video data stream, the magnitude
that the data stream will "scale" is determined by the amount of information
that is encoded in the data stream when it was created; that is, the amount
of data placed in the data stream at creation time determines the "maximum"
playback characteristics that a particular stream can achieve. In turn,
the processing capabilities of the playback system determine how much of
the data can be processed and presented during playback.  Therefore, the
playback characteristics of a given video are a function of the data put
into the video by the author<I> and</I> the processing capabilities of the
playback system.
<P>
The factors affecting the data stream at creation time are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Resolution<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Width and height of video<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Frame duration<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Frequency at which frames are
to be created<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>I-frame rate<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Frequency at which reference frames
are to occur<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Data rate<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Average amount of data allowed for
a second of video<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Factors affecting the playback of a video are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Processing power of the CPU<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Throughput
of data storage (for example, CD-ROM, hard disk, LAN)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Efficiency of the display subsystem (such as
the video adapter and display driver)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
