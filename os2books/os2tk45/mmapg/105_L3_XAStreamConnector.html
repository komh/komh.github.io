<H1>XA Stream Connector</H1><!-- entering slot 116 -->
<P>
The<I> XA stream</I> connector represents the flow of XA ADPCM audio from
the CD-XA device to its associated amplifier-mixer (ampmix) device.  During
playback, the CD-XA device sends audio information from a CD-ROM/XA disc
to the ampmix device for subsequent conversion into audio that can be heard
through conventional speakers or headphones.
<P>
Although volume control is provided by the CD-XA device, the device actually
uses the services provided by the ampmix device to modify the perceived
volume level. If other advanced audio-shaping features are required, the
application can retrieve the device ID of the ampmix device using the MCI_CONNECTION
message. Once the device ID has been obtained, the application can send
set commands directly to the ampmix device to manipulate audio attributes,
such as treble, bass, balance, and so forth.
