RIFF files may consist of nested chunks of information.  MMIO services include
two functions you can use to move between chunks in a RIFF file:  mmioAscend
and mmioDescend.  You might think of these functions as high-level seek
functions.  When you descend into a chunk, the file position is set to the
data field of the chunk (8 bytes from the beginning of the chunk).  For
RIFF and LIST chunks, the file position is set to the location following
the form type or list type (12 bytes from the beginning of the chunk).  When
you ascend out of a chunk, the file position is set to the location following
the end of the chunk.
