<H1>Audio Media Driver Clipboard Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 36 -->
<P>
The data that the buffer or clipboard contains will be defined differently
for each media driver.
<P>
The following formula is necessary to allocate memory for digital audio
clipboard operations:
<BR>
(BitsPerSample/8) x (SamplesPerSecond) x (Channels) x (Seconds)
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
Therefore, if an application is to copy 20 seconds of a 16-bit, 44 kHz,
mono file into the clipboard using the caller's buffer; 1,764,000 bytes
((16/8) x (44100) x (1) x (20)) must be allocated and placed in the<I> pBuff
</I>field of the MCI_EDIT_PARMS structure.  For MCI_CUT, MCI_COPY, and MCI_PASTE,
if MCI_TO_BUFFER or MCI_FROM_BUFFER is passed in, then the<I> pBuff</I> field
should contain a valid pointer.
<P>
MCI_STATUS_CLIPBOARD returns MCI_TRUE if digital audio is in the clipboard;
otherwise it returns MCI_FALSE. MCI_CUT removes the specified range and
places the data in the buffer or clipboard.  The position of the media will
either be the from position if MCI_FROM is specified or the previous position
if MCI_FROM is not specified.  If the buffer is not large enough for the
data an MCIERR_INVALID_BUFFER is returned.  The units of MCI_FROM and MCI_TO
must be supplied in the currently selected time format.  If neither MCI_FROM
or MCI_TO are specified, the operation will start from the current file
position and continue to the end of the file. If audio data is already in
the clipboard, it will be overwritten.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The clipboard contents are emptied before the cut occurs.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
MCI_COPY copies the specified range and places the data in the buffer or
clipboard.  The position of the media remains the same as it was before
the copy operation.
<P>
MCI_PASTE deletes the selected range if the differences between the from
and to position are greater than zero, then inserts the data provided in
the buffer or clipboard.  The media position will be at the end of what
was pasted into the file.  If neither MCI_FROM or MCI_TO are specified,
MCI_PASTE inserts the clipboard contents at the current position. MCI_CONVERT_FORMAT
converts the data that was in the clipboard to the destination file format.
The following data format conversions can be performed:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->16-bit to 8-bit resolution/8-bit to 16-bit resolution
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, and 44.1 kHz to any of the
following sampling rates: 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, or 44.1 kHz<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->mono to stereo/stereo to mono<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MCI_CONVERT_FORMAT flag supports only the Pulse Code Modulation
(PCM) format. The data format conversion can take a while to complete. If
the notify flag is specified, the application is notified when the conversion
is completed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

MCI_PASTE.

The following is an example of using the command string interface with editing
commands to create a repeating sound.

copy a from 0 to 3000 wait
seek a to end
