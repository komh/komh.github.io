<P>
The Audio Recorder Sample (RECORDER) illustrates the concept of recording
audio through the media control interface and how to query a device to find
out the recording capabilities.  The sample program also illustrates how
to change the audio recording and audio device properties, such as bits
per sample, samples per second, input level, and input source.
