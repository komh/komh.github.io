<P>
MULTITRACKWRITE provides a list of records by media type and processes the
data by using the pointers in the write record table to locate the data
in the buffers and write the data to the file.
<P>
If the MULTITRACKWRITE_MERGE bit flag is<I> not</I> set, MULTITRACKWRITE
writes all of the records sequentially from the first entry in the track
map table (for the first track) followed by all records for the second track.

<P>
If the MULTITRACKWRITE_MERGE bit flag is set, MULTITRACKWRITE attempts to
interleave the digitalvideo track with the digitalaudio track. Interleaving
is accomplished based on the size of the audio buffer. For example, if a
4KB audio buffer represents one-third of a second and the frame rate is
15 frames per second, the interleave factor would be 5:1 (5 video frames
to 1 audio chunk).
