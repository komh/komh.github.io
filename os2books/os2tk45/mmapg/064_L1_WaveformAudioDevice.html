<P>
The OS/2 waveform audio (waveaudio) device allows an application to play
or record digital audio using files or application memory buffers.  While
<I>audio</I> refers to the sound waves (changes in air pressure) that have
a perceived effect on the human ear,<I> waveform</I> refers to a digital
representation of the original audio sound wave.  Using one technique called
pulse code modulation (PCM), discrete samples of the sound wave are encoded
by an audio adapter at precise intervals. The numerical value of the sample
increases when the sound wave's force (loudness) increases. The variation
of the sample increases as the frequency of the sound wave increases.
<P>
The number of samples per second taken of the original sound wave as well
as the precision (or resolution) of the sample dictate the quality of the
sound reproduction.  Typical sampling rates include 44 kHz, 22 kHz, and
11 kHz, where kHz is an abbreviation for kilohertz or thousands of cycles
per second.  The sampling precision is usually measured in bits where 8
or 16 bits per sample are representative of most audio adapters. Mono or
stereo refers to the number of channels transferring digital audio.<I> Mono
</I>represents one channel and<I> stereo</I> represents two channels.
<P>
Generally, the higher the sampling rate and resolution, the higher the perceived
quality; however this comes at the expense of potentially enormous data
rates and file sizes. For example, audio quality equivalent to that produced
by a CD audio device requires a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, and 16-bit resolution
for each of the channels in a stereo recording. This information alone results
in a data rate of 176 kilobytes per second!  Luckily, many applications
of digital audio are adequately supported with sampling rates and resolutions
as low as 22 kHz and 8 bits respectively.  The exact choice of parameters
will vary, depending on the requirements of the application.
