<P>
OS/2 multimedia represents audio adapters, CD-ROM drives, videodiscs and
other real hardware devices as logical media devices that are managed by
the Media Device Manager (MDM). Media devices are a logical representation
of the function available from either a real hardware device, software emulation
in combination with real hardware, or pure software emulation. The actual
implementation is not relevant to an application, because the multimedia
system provides device independence with the mciSendCommand and mciSendString
interfaces.
<P>
The following logical devices are currently supported in this release of
OS/2. Additional media devices may be available from IBM or from other companies
as OS/2 multimedia is completely extensible at all levels.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Frequently there is a one-to-one correspondence between a real hardware
device, such as a CD-ROM drive and its associated media device. Other hardware
may be represented as multiple logical devices. For example, a multi-function
audio adapter can be represented as waveform audio, MIDI sequencer, and
amplifier-mixer media devices.
<P>
The following sections describe the function and typical use of each media
device, plus the software model presented to the application developer.
