<H1>Creating a Movie Clip</H1><!-- entering slot 281 -->
<P>
If you have Video IN and one of the supported video capture cards, you can
easily replace ULTIEYES.AVI with a movie clip of your own eyes. Make the
following updates in the Video IN Recorder Settings notebook before you
record the movie:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the reference frame rate to<B> 1</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the audio to<B> Record no audio</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After you record the movie, you are ready to select the frames the ULTIEYES
program will display when the mouse pointer is at various positions in relation
to ULTIEYES:  East, East by Northeast, Northeast, and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the time format of the Video IN Recorder
to frames.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Step through the
movie frame by frame.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Jot down the frame number for each position
on the compass. Also note the beginning and ending frames of the segments
for the left and right winks and the blink. (Note that video segments must
be at least one second in length.)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL> 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Create an ASCII file that contains 25 lines
in the following format:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The
first line in the file is the name of the AVI movie file.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>The
next 24 lines comprise the frame number table (0-23). A description of the
table contents is shown in the following figure. Letter characters on each
line indicate the direction of the gaze associated with that particular
line number. For example, in the frame on line 12 the eyes should be gazing
south by southwest. To see what an actual frame table looks like, open the
ULTIEYES.EYE file.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
