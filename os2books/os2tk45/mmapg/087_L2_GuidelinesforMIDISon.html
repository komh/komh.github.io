<H1>Guidelines for MIDI Song Authors</H1><!-- entering slot 97 -->
<P>
MIDI authors should be aware of several design concerns when producing a
MIDI song:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The General MIDI specification defines a base-level
configuration and an extended-level configuration for synthesizers. Because
you cannot control which synthesizer is used to play your song, you should
provide percussion and melody tracks for both configurations. The table
in the <A HREF="083_L3_ChannelAssignments.html">Channel Assignments</A> section
shows you which channels to allocate.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Put your important melody sounds in the lower-numbered
channels. By prioritizing channel use, you ensure that your song sounds
reasonable when it is played on hardware that supports only a few channels.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When selecting instruments for your MIDI song, use
the instruments that are defined for the most popular MIDI devices. Your
song can then be easily and accurately mapped to other hardware formats.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When using nonpercussive channels, limit the polyphony
(number of simultaneous notes) to 6 notes for the base level and 16 notes
for the extended level.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When using percussion channels, limit the polyphony
to 3 notes for the base level and 16 notes for the extended level.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the standard General MIDI patch assignments and
percussion key assignments shown in the table in the <A HREF="084_L3_PatchAssignments.html">Patch
Assignments</A> section and the figure in the <A HREF="085_L3_PercussionKeyAssignm.html">Percussion
Key Assignments</A> section.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Always send a program change command to a channel
before sending other commands to the channel.  For channels 10 and 16, which
are used for percussion, select patch 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Always send a MIDI main volume controller command
(controller number 7) to a channel after selecting a patch by sending a
program change command.  Use the value of 80 (X'50') for normal listening
levels.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
