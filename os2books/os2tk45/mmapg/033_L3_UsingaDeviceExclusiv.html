<H1>Using a Device Exclusively</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
There are times when an application must retain control of the physical
resource, such as the during the duration of a recording operation or when
the application needs to establish specific settings for the device context.
The application can retain control by<I> not</I> specifying the shareable
flag with the open request or by setting the MCI_EXCLUSIVE flag of the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE
message. When a device has been acquired for exclusive use, other applications
cannot acquire the device until the application using the device closes
it or releases it from exclusive use with the MCI_RELEASEDEVICE message.
When an application releases a device from exclusive use, it does not lose
use of the device until another application acquires it.
<P>
When an application needs to acquire a device context for exclusive use
without acquiring the entire device resource, the application can set the
MCI_EXCLUSIVE_INSTANCE flag of the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message. This flag
prevents the device context from being made inactive unless the application
using the device issues the MCI_CLOSE or MCI_RELEASEDEVICE message.
<P>
The MCI_EXCLUSIVE_INSTANCE and MCI_EXCLUSIVE flags are mutually exclusive.
An instance can be in one of three sharing states:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Instance exclusive<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Device exclusive<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Fully shareable<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Using the MCI_EXCLUSIVE_INSTANCE flag places an instance in an instance-exclusive
sharing state.  Using the MCI_EXCLUSIVE flag places an instance in a device-exclusive
sharing state.  The MCI_RELEASEDEVICE message places an instance in a fully
shareable state.
