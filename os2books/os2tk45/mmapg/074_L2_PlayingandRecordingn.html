<H1>Playing and Recording non-RIFF Waveforms</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
The waveform audio device will create new waveforms according to the RIFF
WAVE data standard.  It is possible, however to play other data formats
using OS/2 multimedia if the appropriate MMIO procedure has been supplied.
 The selection of the appropriate I/O procedure (IOProc) is transparent
to the application if the IOProc has been installed.
<P>
One example of this feature is OS/2 multimedia's ability to play waveform
audio files that were created using IBM's AVC application and the M-Audio
card.  Note that the AVC support provides playback capabilities only.  The
waveform audio device will temporarily report FALSE to the save and record
capabilities of the device capabilities (MCI_GETDEVCAPS) function when the
underlying I/O procedure does not support the creation of files.  Applications
should check the device capabilities to appropriately display a user interface
that reflects the true capabilities of the waveaudio driver and its associated
I/O procedure.
<P>
For example, a waveform editor application should grey out its record button
when an AVC file is loaded, as only playback operations are supported.  Querying
the device capabilities would return FALSE for<B> can record</B>.  If a
waveform file in the RIFF WAVE format is subsequently loaded, the record
button should be enabled, because the same<B> can record</B> query will
now return TRUE. In all instances, by using the high-level OS/2 multimedia
mciSendString or mciSendCommand interface to reference device capabilities,
the application is shielded from the underlying implementation.
