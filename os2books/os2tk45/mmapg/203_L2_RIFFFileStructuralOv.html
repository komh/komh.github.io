<H1>RIFF File Structural Overview</H1><!-- entering slot 219 -->
<P>
A RIFF chunk begins with a chunk ID, which is a four-character code (FOURCC)
that identifies the representation of the chunk data.  A program reading
a RIFF file can skip over any chunk whose chunk ID it does not recognize.
 The chunk ID is followed by a four-character chunk size (ULONG) specifying
the size of the data field in the chunk.  Lastly, it contains a data field
containing the actual data of the chunk. If the chunk ID is RIFF, the first
four characters of the data portion of the chunk are a form type; if the
chunk ID is LIST, the first four characters are a list type.
<P>

<P>
The only chunks allowed to contain other chunks (subchunks) are those with
a chunk ID of RIFF or LIST.  The first chunk in a RIFF file must be a RIFF
chunk.  All other chunks in the file are subchunks of the RIFF chunk as
shown.
