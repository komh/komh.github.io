<H1>Opening the Waveform Audio Device</H1><!-- entering slot 79 -->
<P>
The following string commands open the default waveaudio device and load
a file onto it.
<PRE>open waveaudio alias wave shareable
load wave c:\mysounds\train.wav
</PRE>

<P>
OS/2 multimedia allows you to specify the device to be used for a particular
file based on the file's extension or its extended attributes (EAs). Using
.TYPE EAs is the preferred method, because they remain with the files even
when the files are renamed. Both file extensions and extended attributes
can be associated with a device using the Multimedia Setup application.
 For instance, assuming files with an extension of .WAV have been associated
with the waveaudio device, the following command will result in a file being
loaded into the waveaudio device:
<PRE>open c:\mysounds\monkey.wav alias monkey shareable
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, both the device element and the device type can be specified:
<PRE>open c:\mysounds\paperjam.wav type waveaudio alias wave shareable
</PRE>
