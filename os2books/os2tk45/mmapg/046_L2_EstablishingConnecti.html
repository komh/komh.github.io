<H1>Establishing Connections between Devices</H1><!-- entering slot 54 -->
<P>
A<I> connection</I> is the establishment of a flow of information from one
device connector to a compatible connector on another device.  One example
of a connection is the attachment of a speaker to an audio card with speaker
wire.  Typically, an application might enable the speaker connector on an
audio card, causing the flow of information out of the speaker connector.
 If you have connected the wire, then the audio is heard.  In this case
the multimedia system must rely on a person to make the actual connection.

<P>
Another category of connection exists where the connection is made internally
in the computer, typically through the transfer of digital information from
one media device to another.  For instance, the waveaudio media device has
a connection to its associated amplifier mixer device.
