<P>
This chapter describes how to create and manage your own customized windows,
graphic buttons and secondary windows. OS/2 multimedia applications, such
as Volume Control shown in the following figure provide you with examples
of multimedia control implementations.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="157_L1_OS2MultimediaControl_9.gif" WIDTH=409 HEIGHT=127>
<P>
The SW.DLL dynamic link library, located in the \MMOS2\DLL subdirectory
contains the functions that support creating and manipulating these controls.
(The SW.H file is included with the Toolkit and contains the prototypes,
constants, and data structures your application needs.) Refer to the<I> PM
Guide and Reference</I> for information on creating circular sliders (dials).

<P>
Refer to the<I> CUA Guide to Multimedia User Interface Design</I> for more
information about creating consistent user interfaces for multimedia controls.
