<H1>Buffered File I/O</H1><!-- entering slot 205 -->
<P>
Using buffers improves the performance of multimedia applications that perform
numerous file I/O operations when accessing media devices.  With buffered
file I/O, the system maintains a block of memory that the operating system
uses to store data as it is read from (or written to) the disk.  If data
is already in the buffer, the operating system can transfer the record to
the application's area without reading the sector from the disk.  This improves
performance by reducing the number of times the application accesses the
disk for read or write operations.  The application only accesses the media
device when the buffer must be filled from or written to the disk.
<P>
Many factors must be considered when deciding whether or not to use buffered
file I/O; for example, the number and size of read and write operations.
 Although it is difficult to identify criteria for using buffered I/O, there
are some general guidelines you can follow.  It is a good idea to use buffered
I/O for applications that perform many I/O operations, less than 4KB each.
 However, if you are performing I/O operations where buffer sizes may be
larger than 4KB (as in the case of streaming), it might be best to use unbuffered
I/O.  If an application such as the Sync/Stream Manager (SSM) provides its
own internal buffers, a secondary set of buffers during run-time may hinder,
rather than improve, performance.  Experiment to optimize file I/O for your
application's requirements.
