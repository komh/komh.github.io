<P>
The Caption Creation Utility (CAPTION) is part of the sample captioning
system provided with the Toolkit. See <A HREF="153_L1_Captioning.html">Captioning
</A>for additional information on this sample captioning system.
<P>
The Caption Creation Utility program enables the synchronization of an audio
file with a text file.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This concept can be extended beyond audio and text to apply
to many possibilities, such as synchronizing audio and video, or synchronizing
video and text.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
While the audio file is playing, the Caption Creation Utility program issues
the MCI_STATUS command to obtain a media-position value of the audio file.
The media-position value is combined with the text file to produce a caption
file.  An application can use the resulting caption file in conjunction
with the Caption DLL to provide captioning in an application.
