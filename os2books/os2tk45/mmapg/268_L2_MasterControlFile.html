<P>
The master control file, CONTROL.SCR, contains information about each installable
feature.  It identifies specific file information that MINSTALL requires
to install the requested features.  This control file must be named CONTROL.SCR
and must reside on the first media unit (diskette or CD) of the installation
package.
<P>
During installation, if any errors are detected in the master control file,
the main installation selection window will be empty and the errors will
be logged in the error log MINSTALL.LOG.  You can access this file for information
about the errors.
<P>
The CONTROL.SCR file consists of a header section and a subsystem definition
section.  The header section comes first and provides general information
for the installation procedure.  The subsystem definition section comes
next and provides information about the features in the installation package.
