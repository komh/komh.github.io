<P>
A secondary window provides a sizeable and scrollable dialog interface.
Secondary window functions are compatible with PM dialog window functions,
so it is an easy task to make changes to existing code that uses the PM
dialog window functions.
<P>
The secondary window uses two frame windows, a standard frame and a dialog
frame. The standard frame window offers the standard services-moving, sizing,
minimizing, maximizing, and closing-as well as a service for resizing the
window to a default size.
<P>
The window handle returned by WinLoadSecondaryWindow is the handle to the
standard frame. This handle is used when associating a help instance, modifying
the title bar or system menu, and doing WinSetWindowPos operations.
<P>
The window handle that is used to pass messages to the secondary window
procedure pointed to by WinLoadSecondaryWindow is the dialog window handle.
This handle is used to access controls on the dialog with the WinWindowFromID
function. An application can get a handle to the dialog window by passing
the outer frame window handle to WinQuerySecondaryHWND. The dialog window
is a child of the standard window's FID_CLIENT window.
<P>
When the secondary window is opened, the frame window is set to the default
size, which accommodates the dimensions of the dialog window. If the user
makes the client window smaller by sizing the frame window, the dialog window
is clipped and vertical and horizontal scroll bars appear. Selecting<B> Default
Size</B> restores the frame window to the optimal size for displaying the
dialog. Because the Sizeable Dialog Frame Manager manages the display of
the standard window and its scroll bars automatically, the application needs
to manage only the dialog window.
<P>
The OS/2 multimedia Volume Control application, shown in the beginning of
the <A HREF="157_L1_OS2MultimediaControl.html">OS/2 Multimedia Controls
</A>section, provides an example of a modeless secondary window implementation.
