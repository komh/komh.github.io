<P>
The IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp includes the bindings, header
files, and libraries for developing OS/2 multimedia applications.
<P>
A PM message queue is required for all OS/2 multimedia applications because
it enables the efficient sharing of devices in the OS/2 multimedia environment.

<P>
The minimum stack size for an OS/2 multimedia application is 32KB; however,
for better performance, use a stack size of 64KB.
<P>
All OS/2 multimedia public interfaces, for example error message defines
and common definitions, are accessible through the OS2ME.H file. Constants
and prototypes for multimedia window control functions, MMIO file services
functions, and high-level interfaces are accessible after the following
defines are included in your application:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Define</B><!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL><B> Services</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>#define INCL_SW<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> Window Control Functions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>#define INCL_MMIOOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> MMIO File Services<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>#define INCL_MACHDR<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> High-Level Services<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
OS/2 multimedia applications should link with the MMPM2.LIB library.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> OS/2 multimedia header files have naming conventions compatible
with the standard OS/2 format.  Applications using previous versions of
the MMPM/2 header files will still use those header files by default when
the applications are compiled.  In order to use the OS/2-consistent header
files in an application, define INCL_OS2MM in the program. Defining INCL_OS2MM
automatically defines the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
INCL_MCIOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> MCI-related include files (MCIOS2.H
and MMDRVOS2.H)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>INCL_MMIOOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> MMIO include file (MMIOOS2.H)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
All existing applications remain binary compatible.  If they are recompiled
a choice of which set of headers to use is available. If new header files
are used, the source code must be modified to conform to the name changes.
