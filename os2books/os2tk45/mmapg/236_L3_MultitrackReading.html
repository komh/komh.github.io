<P>
MULTITRACKREAD is supplied an empty buffer. The size is determined by<I> ulLength</I>,
and it is pointed to by<I> pBuffer</I>. MULTITRACKREAD processes the data
by reading<I> ulLength</I> bytes of data into the buffer, and then parsing
the data in the buffer by media type (audio or video) into records. A pointer
to the data in the buffer is placed in the appropriate record table.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A record is a contiguous buffer containing data of the same
media type.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
During the processing of MULTITRACKREAD in extended mode,<I> pBuffer</I> points
to the beginning of the buffer on the first call to MULTITRACKREAD and<I> ulLength
</I>indicates the number of bytes to be read into the buffer. With each
call to MULTITRACKREAD,<I> ulBufferLength</I> (the actual total buffer length)
is reduced by<I> ulLength</I> bytes, and<I> pBuffer</I> points to the current
location in the buffer. Subsequent calls to MULTITRACKREAD reads<I> ulLength
</I>bytes of data into the buffer starting at<I> pBuffer</I> and repeats
the process until<I> ulBufferLength</I> is reached.
<P>
This implementation of MULTITRACKREAD allows smaller amounts of data to
be read at one time while allowing frames greater than the<I> ulLength</I> of
the read. For example, if the program wanted to fill a 128KB buffer while
doing 32KB reads, the calling sequence to MULTITRACKREAD would be (32KB,
128KB), (32KB, 96KB), (32KB, 64KB), and (32KB, 32KB) for (<I>ulLength</I>,
<I>ulBufferLength</I>). With this setup, MULTITRACKREAD can span frames
across the 32KB buffers and know the size of the 128KB buffer.
<P>
During MULTITRACKREAD processing in regular mode,<I> pBuffer</I> always
points to the beginning of the buffer and<I> ulLength</I> indicates the
number of bytes to be read into the buffer. The buffer is filled completely
with each call to MULTITRACKREAD and subsequent calls, to MULTITRACKREAD,
read<I> ulLength</I> bytes of data into the buffer starting at the beginning
of the buffer (pointed to by<I> pBuffer</I>).
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the MULTITRACKREAD_EXTENDED bit flag is set, the calling
routine has passed the extended MMMULTITRACKREAD structure with the new
<I>ulBufferLength</I> field in this structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
