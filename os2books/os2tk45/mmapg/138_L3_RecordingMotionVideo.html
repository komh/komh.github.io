<P>
The digital video device supports real-time recording of motion video into
AVI files.  The supported compression algorithms for recording video are
Ultimotion, Indeo 2.1, and Indeo 3.1. The default settings for real-time
recording are 160 x 120 resolution, 15 frames per second, and Ultimotion
compression type.
<P>
Recording into new and existing files is supported. The following example
illustrates recording live video. As recording takes place, the digital
audio and video data is stored in the temporary file created for the video
device element. After the recording operation is complete, the device element
is played back so it can be viewed before it is saved as a permanent file
on disk.
<P>
To save the data as a video file, you can specify an existing file name
or a new file name with the<B> save</B> command. If you indicate an existing
file name, the data in the disk file is completely replaced by the data
in the temporary file. You can also indicate that the file being saved is
a<I> video</I> file; however, it is not necessary because this is the default.

<P>
In the example, monitoring is set on, so that the incoming video signal
can be viewed in the default video window before it is recorded. Monitoring
of live video can also be done without recording.

<P>
Applications can specify that only video or only audio is to be recorded.
In the following example, audio recording is turned off, so that only video
will be recorded.
<P>
Specifying the<B> cue input</B> command causes the default window to become
visible, so it is not necessary to set the monitoring function on. The<B> cue
</B>command ensures the device is initialized and ready to record, preventing
the possibility of losing any initial video when recording begins. As in
the previous example, the device element is played back before it is saved
as a file on disk.
