<H1>Creating New Files</H1><!-- entering slot 81 -->
<P>
The waveaudio device will create a new file on either the MCI_OPEN or MCI_LOAD
commands if a file element is indicated (MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT_ID) and the specified
file name does not exist. If no file name is indicated, the waveaudio driver
will create an unnamed temporary file.  If an unnamed temporary file is
created, it can later be named by issuing the MCI_SAVE command, which must
include the permanent name of the new file.
<P>
To support file creation from the string interface, a special file name
called<B> new</B> is reserved for system use.  This file name should be
used in place of the usual application supplied file name.  As in the command
message interface, the<B> save</B> command must be issued to give the file
a permanent name.

</PRE>

<P>
When a file is initially created, default settings will be assigned by the
media driver and might depend on the capabilities of the audio adapter.
 The IBM waveform audio driver will use PCM, 22 kHz, 16 bits per sample,
and mono as the default for 16-bit adapters.  If the adapter does not support
16-bit PCM, then the resolution (bits per sample) will be downgraded to
8 bits.
<P>
The following table lists audio adapters supported by OS/2 multimedia. The
default settings are those initially assigned by the media driver to a new
file when that particular audio adapter is being used.

<P>
OS/2 multimedia enables recording of digital audio information in the format
that fits specific needs, such as space or quality.  For example, assume
that a new waveaudio file is created with the following command:
<PRE>open new type waveaudio alias a wait
</PRE>

<P>
When the file is created, you might want a file that is compatible with
mu-law (the compression scheme used by the telephone system). To change
the compression scheme, the format tag must be set for the file.  The following
string commands prepare the file for recording mu-law by setting the format
tag:
<PRE>set a format tag mulaw wait
set a bitspersample 8 wait
set a channels 1 wait
set a samplespersec 11025 wait
</PRE>

<P>
If you wanted to record with a compression scheme commonly used in Europe
(a-law), the following command could have been issued:
<PRE>set a format tag alaw wait
</PRE>

<P>
An application should always set the waveform format, sampling rate, resolution,
and number of channels to ensure that the waveform is created with the desired
parameters as shown in the following string interface example.
<PRE>set wave format tag PCM wait
set wave samplespersec 22050 wait
set wave bitspersample 8 wait
set wave channels 1 wait
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> When modifying the settings on a waveaudio device, the<I> format
tag</I> should be changed first, because it might force the automatic modification
of other settings to make them compatible with the new format.  For instance,
a waveaudio device that supports 16-bit PCM might only support 8-bit ADPCM.
 Changing the format from PCM to ADPCM will automatically change the bits
per sample setting.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
