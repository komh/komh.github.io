<H1>Playing Hardware-Assisted MPEG Files</H1><!-- entering slot 147 -->
<P>
The RealMagic adapter enables hardware-assisted playback of MPEG files.
MPEG video content is contained in an MPEG-specific file format.  This file
format, like AVI, interleaves audio and video data but is quite different
from the tagged AVI format and requires a unique IOProc.  The MPEG IOProc
performs the file-format processing in the hardware-assisted environment,
while decompression of both audio and video is performed by the hardware.

<P>
The digital video device provides normal-speed playback support (in the
forward direction only) of MPEG files. The common file extension for MPEG
files is .MPG. Seeking is supported, however seeking is an approximation
to the nearest MPEG<I> picture group</I>.  The size of a picture group is
movie-dependent but is commonly 8 frames, so seeking takes place to within
one-third of a second, in most cases.
