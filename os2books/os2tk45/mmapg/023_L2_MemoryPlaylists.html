<H1>Memory Playlists</H1><!-- entering slot 27 -->
<P>
In addition to specifying files or Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF)
chunks to be loaded by compound devices, you also can specify memory objects.
You create memory objects, for example, to play synthesized audio using
the waveform audio media driver. These memory objects can be placed under
the control of the memory playlist.
<P>
The memory playlist is a data structure in an application. It contains an
array of simple, machine-like instructions you formulate, each of which
has a fixed format consisting of a 32-bit operation code and three 32-bit
operands. Playlist instructions are described in the following table.
<P>
To have playlist instructions interpreted by the playlist processor, you
specify the MCI_OPEN_PLAYLIST flag with the MCI_OPEN command message. This
flag indicates that the<I> pszElementName</I> field in the MCI_OPEN_PARMS
data structure is a pointer to a memory playlist.
<P>
Using playlist instructions, you can play audio objects in succession from
one or more memory buffers. Instructions include branching to and returning
from subroutines within the playlist. In addition, the playlist can be modified
dynamically by the application while it is being played. Because less overhead
is involved when playing audio data from memory, playlist programs will
have higher performance. If your application requires speed or if it needs
to modify the data before it is sent to the audio device, use playlists.

│                    │recording or playback operation. For a playback   │
│                    │operation, it is the number of bytes that have    │
│                    │been sent to the output device handler. For a     │
│                    │recording operation, it is the number of bytes    │
│                    │that have been placed into a user buffer.         │
│                    │The current position in the buffer is particularly│
│                    │important after a recording operation, because    │
│                    │this field contains the number of bytes of        │
│                    │recorded data.  The remaining bytes in the buffer │
│                    │are not valid. This field is initialized to zero  │
│                    │when the DATA_OPERATION statement is first        │
│                    │encountered.                                      │
│                    │The buffer indicated by the DATA instruction must │

│                    │and cannot include any header information.        │
│                    │Therefore, the precise meaning or format of the   │
│                    │data is dependent on the current settings of the  │
│                    │media device.  For example, a wave audio data     │
│                    │element is assumed to have the format PCM or      │
│                    │ADPCM, number of bits per sample, and so on, that │

│LOOP_OPERATION      │Controls iteration in a playlist. It is the       │

│                    │the current iteration.  The current iteration is  │
│                    │reset to zero following loop termination.         │
│                    │Operand 1-Number of times the loop is to be       │
│                    │executed.                                         │

│                    │Operand 3-Current iteration.                      │
│                    │The last instruction in a loop is a branch back to│
│                    │the LOOP_OPERATION. The operation of the          │
│                    │LOOP_OPERATION instruction is as follows:         │
│                    │1. If Operand 3 is less than Operand 1, control is│
│                    │transferred to the playlist instruction following │
│                    │the LOOP instruction, and the iteration count in  │
│                    │Operand 3 is incremented.                         │
│                    │2. Otherwise, the iteration count is reset to zero│
│                    │and control is passed to the instruction specified│
│                    │in Operand 2.                                     │
│                    │Typically, the application sets the iteration     │
│                    │count to zero when the playlist is passed to the  │
│                    │device, but this is not required.  The loop       │
│                    │instruction merely compares the loop count with   │
│                    │the iteration count. If the iteration count is set│
│                    │to a value other than zero when the playlist is   │
│                    │passed in, it is as if the loop has been executed │
│                    │that number of times. Also, if a playback         │
│                    │operation is stopped, and then the same playlist  │
│                    │is loaded again, the loop iteration count is not  │
│                    │initialized by the playlist processor.            │
│                    │It is the application's responsibility to see that│
│                    │iteration count values are what is required when  │
│                    │switching from play to record, record to play, and│
│                    │when changing settings for the data (for example, │

│                    │set command. These commands cause the playlist    │
│                    │stream to be destroyed and re-created, and the    │
│                    │playlist to be reassociated as a new playlist with│
