<P>
The CD audio media device provides access to devices that read compact discs
for the purpose of playing CD audio. A typical use for CD audio is to provide
high quality audio for use in a presentation.  Another use of CD audio would
be to provide detailed audio help for an application user.  Instead of the
usual hyperlinked text and graphics, an entire step by step audio tutorial
might be stored on a compact disc in several different languages.
