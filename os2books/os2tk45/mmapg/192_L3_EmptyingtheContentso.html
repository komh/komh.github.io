<H1>Emptying the Contents of an I/O Buffer</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
Emptying the contents of an I/O buffer means that the contents of the buffer
are written to disk.  You can empty the contents of a buffer by calling
mmioFlush or mmioClose.  The buffer is automatically emptied when you close
a file by calling mmioClose.  If you do not close a file immediately after
writing to it, empty the contents of the buffer to make sure the information
is written to disk.  You can also use the MMIO_EMPTYBUF flag of mmioFlush
to clear the I/O buffer without deallocating the buffer.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The mmioFlush function may fail if there is insufficient disk
space to write the buffer, even if the preceding mmioWrite functions succeeded.
