<P>
Resolution of video determines how much spatial information is in a video
file.  Ultimotion compression algorithms organize this data so that it can
be easily scaled up or down by factors of two as it is decompressed. Furthermore,
as the data is decompressed, a sufficiently powered playback system can
duplicate the data during output and display the video at four times its
original size. This results in an effective output size larger than the
input size.  In this way, Ultimotion can be<B> scaled down</B> on systems
incapable of processing the authored video resolution and<B> scaled up</B> on
systems with more processing capability than the authored video requires.
