<P>
Applications can perform event synchronization by taking an action at a
specified point during the playback of a data object. There are two ways
an application can do this:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The application can request to be notified when a
specified point in playback is encountered by sending the MCI_SET_CUEPOINT
message to the multimedia system.  When this cue point is encountered, the
multimedia system sends an MM_MCICUEPOINT message to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The application can request notification on a periodic
basis, based on time or position, by sending the MCI_SET_POSITION_ADVISE
message to the multimedia system.  As each time period (or position) specified
passes, the multimedia system sends an MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE message to the
application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
