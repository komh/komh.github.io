<H1>Dynamic Playlist Modification</H1><!-- entering slot 32 -->
<P>
An application can change a playlist dynamically to achieve various effects
in controlling the data stream in memory.  In the case of the Clock Sample
program, if the chime is an hour chime, then the program will dynamically
modify the loop instruction in the memory playlist structure.  This is how
the device playing the playlist knows how many times to play the chime.
 The variable<I> usHour</I> is assigned the valid hour in the UpdateTheClock
procedure.
<PRE>      /*
       * Set the playlist to loop for the number of hours to
       * be played.  The hour value will be placed into operand one
       * of the loop instruction playlist structure.*/

           apltPlayList[ HOUR_PLAYLIST ][ LOOP_LINE ].ulOperandOne =
               ((ULONG) (usHour));
</PRE>

<P>
Manipulations that entail atomic, or uninterruptible, operations are acceptable
techniques for achieving special effects with playlists. For example, the
modification of the 32-bit operation code of an instruction is considered
to be an atomic operation. Changing BRANCH to NOP, NOP to BRANCH, or changing
the loop count value of a LOOP instruction are examples of atomic operations
that produce special effects.
<P>
Because the playlist processor is asynchronously interpreting instructions,
care must be taken to avoid a situation where unexpected results can occur.
For example, suppose a situation exists that enables the loop count field
to be modified by the application at the same time that the LOOP instruction
is being executed by the playlist processor. The playlist processor can
overwrite the application modification with a loop count value based on
the execution of the LOOP instruction.
<P>
More extensive modifications (particularly those to pointer and length parameters
of DATA instructions) should also be performed with caution.  You do not
want the playlist processor to gain control of a partially modified instruction.

<P>
As a rule, it is not a good idea to modify a DATA instruction unless you
are sure the playlist processor cannot interpret the instruction during
the modification process; that is, you know the instruction is currently
unreachable by the processor.  One way to determine the location of the
processor is with the MESSAGE instruction.  For example, suppose you precede
a LOOP instruction with a MESSAGE instruction. When the message is returned
to your application, you know the processor is busy with the loop and you
can safely modify any DATA instructions outside the loop.
<P>
After DATA instructions have been modified, BRANCH or NOP instructions can
be changed to direct playlist interpretation to the modified section of
the playlist.
