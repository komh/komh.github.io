<H1>DIVE - Direct Interface Video Extensions Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 265 -->
<P>
The DIVE Sample illustrates the use of direct interface video extensions
(DIVE), which provides optimized blitting performance for motion video subsystems
and applications that perform rapid screen updates in the OS/2 PM and full-screen
environments. Using DIVE interfaces, applications can either write directly
to video memory or use the DIVE blitter. The DIVE blitter will take advantage
of acceleration hardware when present and applicable to the function being
performed.
<P>
Using DIVE, the sample program blits a series of 16 compressed 256-color
bit maps to the screen. For more information on how to use the DIVE functions
included in this sample program, see <A HREF="144_L1_DirectInterfaceVideo.html">Direct
Interface Video Extensions (DIVE)</A>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The DIVE sample requires OS/2 Warp, Version 3 in order to
execute properly. The files for the samples will be installed when the samples
are selected, but Workplace Shell objects will not be created for them if
the installed operating system is not OS/2 Warp, Version 3.
<P>
The OS/2 Warp color support defaults to 16 colors. This means that your
setup needs to be updated, otherwise the DIVE sample will not run.
<P>
The maximum window size of this sample has been limited to 640x480 because
larger window sizes may cause excessive swapping on machines with less than
16MB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
