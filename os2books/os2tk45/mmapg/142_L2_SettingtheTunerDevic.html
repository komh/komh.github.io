<H1>Setting the Tuner Device</H1><!-- entering slot 153 -->
<P>
With the appropriate hardware, the digital video device is able to monitor
a TV channel.  The WinTV card is an overlay card that has video capture
support as well as television signal support.  The monitor window displays
the TV signal.  The tuner is selected by setting the digital video device
connector type to<B> video in</B> and the connector number to the tuner
connector number of the adapter. The tuner connector number varies from
adapter to adapter. On the WinTV adapter, this is connector number 2.
<PRE>connector digitalvideo02 enable type video in number 2 wait

<P>
An application can use the<B> settuner</B> command to set the region, channel,
and fine-tuning values.  These flags are valid when used individually or
in any combination. The digital video device uses these three values to
calculate a frequency to send to the device. See the following example.

<PRE>open digitalvideo03 alias mytuner wait
settuner mytuner tv channel 3 region usa finetune plus 1 wait
</PRE>

<P>
The following example illustrates setting the frequency directly.  Setting
the frequency directly causes channel, region, and fine-tuning values to
be ignored.
<PRE>settuner mytuner frequency 80 wait
</PRE>

<P>
The region value must have a corresponding ASCII file (<I>region</I>.RGN)
located in the \MMOS2\REGION subdirectory. When an application selects the
region with the<B> settuner</B> command, the digital video device reads
in the region file and fills a region array.  The channel is used as an
index into this array, which identifies the frequency.  Fine-tuning is then
added to the frequency.  Region files are keyword-driven and have the following
format:
<PRE>[tuner]
  description=USA Cable
  lowchannel=2
  highchannel=99
  frequencies=0,0, 10050, -1, ... 29000
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> description</I> keyword identifies a descriptive string displayed
on the corresponding Multimedia Setup page. The<I> lowchannel</I> and<I> highchannel
</I>keywords indicate the range of channels available for the region.  The
frequencies correspond to the channel values, beginning with channel 0 and
continuing to the highest available channel. The frequencies must be listed
in columns of nine; otherwise, the region is invalid. A frequency value
of 0 indicates the channel is out of range. A frequency value of -1 indicates
a skipped channel, allowing the user to "block" certain channels from being
viewed.
