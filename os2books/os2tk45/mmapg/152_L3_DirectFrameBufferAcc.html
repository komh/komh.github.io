<H1>Direct Frame-Buffer Access</H1><!-- entering slot 164 -->
<P>
As mentioned earlier,<I> *ppFrameBuffer</I> returned by DiveOpen gives direct
addressability to the frame buffer.  In order to write directly to the frame
buffer, the DIVE application must perform its own clipping, color conversion,
and bank switching. The following functions are provided for direct frame-buffer
access:  DiveAcquireFrameBuffer, DiveDeacquireFrameBuffer, DiveSwitchBank,
and DiveCalcFrameBufferAddress.
<P>
The DiveQueryCaps function returns whether the display subsystem is bank-switched.
DIVE provides another function called DiveCalcFrameBufferAddress to get
to a location in the frame buffer that corresponds to a rectangle in desktop
coordinates:
<PRE>PRECTL prectlDest;            /* Image rectangle in desktop coors  */
PVOID pDestinationAddress;    /* Frame buffer address - output     */
PULONG pulBankNumber;         /* Display h/w bank number - output  */
PULONG pulRemlinesInBank;     /* Lines left in bank - output       */

ulErrorCode = DiveCalcFrameBufferAddress(
        hDiveInst, &amp;prectlDest, &amp;pDestinationAddress,
        &amp;pulBankNumber, &amp;pulRemlinesInBank);
</PRE>

<P>
To accomplish correct clipping,<I> prectlDest</I> must be in the application
window's visible region.  If the display hardware is bank-switched, then
the application must not write more than<I> pulRemlinesInBank</I> lines
of output before switching banks.  The data written to<I> pDestinationAddress
</I>must be in the color-encoding scheme of the screen (also provided by
DiveQueryCaps).  (Of course, DIVE can be used to convert to the correct
screen color-encoding prior to writing to the frame buffer by doing a DiveBlitImage
to a destination buffer with the same color-encoding.)  Additionally, if
the screen supports only 256 colors, the data must match the current physical
palette.
<P>
All write access to the frame buffer must be bracketed by calls to DiveAcquireFrameBuffer
and DiveDeacquireFrameBuffer.  Also, the application must not attempt to
access the frame buffer between receipt of a WM_VRNDISABLED message and
a WM_VRNENABLED message.
<P>
A typical application would do the following:
<PRE>BOOL  fKeepBlitting = TRUE;
BOOL  fFBAccessOK;
RECTL rectlOutput;      /* Image rectangle in desktop coors  */
RECTL rectlDest;        /* Portion to blit in this bank */
ULONG ulMoreLines;      /* Lines in image left to blit  */
LONG  lBlitTop;         /* Top of next blit     */
PVOID pDestinationAddress;   /* Frame buffer address - output */
ULONG ulBankNumber;          /* Display h/w bank number - output */
ULONG ulRemlinesInAperature; /* Lines left in bank - output  */
BOOL  fAcquired = FALSE;     /* Acquired frame buffer yet    */

while (fKeepBlitting)
  {
  /* ... Call DiveSetupBlitter as before ...    */

  /********************************************************/
  /* Calculate total number of lines to blit.  Then blit  */
  /* only those lines that will fit in the current bank.  */
  /* Switch to successive banks until the entire image is */
  /* blitted.                                             */
  /********************************************************/
  ulMoreLines = rectlDest.yTop - rectlDest.yBottom;
  memcpy( &amp;rectlDest, &amp;rectlOutput, sizeof(RECTL));
  while (ulMoreLines &amp;&amp; fFBAccessOK)
    {
    ulErrorCode = DiveCalcFrameBufferAddress(
        hDive, rectlDest, &amp;pDestinationAddress,
        &amp;ulBankNumber, &amp;ulRemlinesInAperture);
    if (!fAcquired)
      if (!DiveAcquireFrameBuffer( hDive, ulBankNumber))
        fAcquired = TRUE;
      else break;
    DiveSwitchBank( hDive, ulBankNumber);
      {
      /* ... write data for (ulRemlinesInAperture) top lines of */
      /* rectlDest to pDestinationAddress ...   */
      if (ulRemlinesInAperture &lt; ulMoreLines)
        {               /* if need next bank    */
        rectlDest.yTop -= ulRemlinesInAperture;
        ulMoreLines -= ulRemlinesInAperture;
        }
      else ulMoreLines = 0;
      }
    if (fAcquired)
      DiveDeacquireFrameBuffer( hDive);
    }           /* end: while more lines to blit */
  }             /* end: blitter loop    */

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This method works only on even bank breaks; indirect access
through DiveBlitImage is recommended on displays with bank breaks that are
not aligned on scan-line boundaries.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
In the previous example, the application spins off a separate thread to
perform blitting.  The procedure for this thread contains a<!-- entering slot 165 --> nested
loop that switches display banks for each image blitted as long as blitting
is needed.  The flag fFBAccessOK is turned off whenever the application
window received WM_VRNDISABLED and is turned on whenever WM_VRNENABLED is
received.
