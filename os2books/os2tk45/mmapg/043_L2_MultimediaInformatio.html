<H1>Multimedia Information and OS/2 Multimedia Connectors</H1><!-- entering slot 51 -->
<P>
A<I> connector</I> is a software representation of the physical way in which
multimedia data moves from one device to another.  Simple examples are the
headphone jack on a CD-ROM player, or the speakers jack on an audio adapter.
 If an audio card has both a speaker and a line OUT jack, it is desirable
to let an application choose the destination of the audio, while remaining
independent from the actual hardware implementation.
<P>
OS/2 multimedia connectors provide this function by allowing an application
to query which connectors are supported by a logical device, and manipulate
whether or not information is flowing through the connector. The connectors
for a logical device can be accessed either by number or by a symbolic connector
type.  When specifying a symbolic type such as<I> microphone</I> or<I> line
IN</I>, a number can also be specified to select the first connector, second
connector, and so on, of that specific connector type. The MCI_CONNECTORINFO
message can be used to determine which connectors are supported by a device,
whereas the MCI_CONNECTOR message can be used to enable, disable, or query
the state of a particular connector.
<P>
Although connectors are typically associated with the representation of
externally visible audio and video jacks on multimedia equipment, another
category of connectors can represent the flow of information within a computer.
 For example, a connector on an audio adapter can be attached to the internal
PC speaker.  A more subtle example is the flow of digital audio information
into an audio adapter.  This information could come from a file, system
memory, or another device.  Connectors of this category are referred to
as<I> stream</I> connectors to convey the idea of a logical stream of information
flowing from one device to another.
