<P>
A LIST chunk contains a list, or ordered sequence, of subchunks.  LIST chunks
also include an additional field in the first 4 bytes of the data field.
 This additional field contains the<I> list type</I> of the field, which
is a four-character code identifying the contents of the list.  For example,
a LIST chunk with a list type of INFO can contain ICOP and ICRD chunks providing
copyright and creation date information.
<P>
If an application recognizes the list type, it should know how to interpret
the sequence of subchunks.  However, since a LIST chunk may contain only
subchunks (after the list type), an application that does not know about
a specific list type can still navigate through the sequence of subchunks.
