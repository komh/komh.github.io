Ultimotion is a playback-time scalable-video data stream. While the frame
rate, output resolution, and color depth characteristics of a video are
set when the video is created, the characteristics of a playback-scalable
video are modified during playback utilizing the capabilities of the playback
platform. These playback-platform capabilities depend on the type of microprocessor,
display driver, video adapter, and data bandwidth available during playback.
