<H1>Default and Device Context Connections</H1><!-- entering slot 55 -->
<P>
Device connections are usually automatically established by the media device
when the device is opened.  The choice of connection is determined by a
default established during installation of the media driver, and can be
re-established using the MCI_DEFAULT_CONNECTION message.
<P>
Once opened, the media device may open and connect to another media device
to provide the complete function of the originally opened device to the
application.  This is transparent to the calling application.  One example
is the waveaudio device, which uses a connected amplifier-mixer device to
actually produce sound from the digital audio stream.  The waveaudio device
also uses the services of the amplifier-mixer device to set the volume.

<P>
While some services of the connected device can be surfaced in the definition
of the originally opened device, the connected device can also provide some
extended features beyond those required by the original device.  If the
application wishes to access these extended features, it can get the handle
to the particular device context or<I> instance</I> of the connected device,
using the MCI_CONNECTION message.
<P>
Note the subtle difference between a default connection and a device context
connection.  A default connection is the name of a connected device, whereas
a device context connection is the actual handle to a particular instance
of an opened device.  An example of this is a waveaudio01 device that has
a default connection to an ampmix01 device.  When the waveaudio01 device
is opened, it automatically opens the ampmix01 device, creating an instance
of each device.  Because devices may be shared in OS/2 multimedia, the waveaudio01
device can be opened again by another application and two new instances
will be created.  Although the default connection is the same in both cases,
the device context connections are different.
