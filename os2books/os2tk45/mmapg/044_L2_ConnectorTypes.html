<H1>Connector Types</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->
<P>
Each connector is defined by specific type or name, so that applications
can make requests symbolically instead of using an absolute connector number
that is device dependent.  If an application specifies only a connector
type, then the default connector of that type is selected on the device.
 Both a type and a number may be specified to select connectors when more
than one connector of the same type exists on a device.
<P>
The following table describes connector types and typical uses.
