<P>
OS/2 multimedia provides support to OS/2 Presentation Manager applications
for controlling playback and recording of motion video.  Playback of video
can be performed in either a default window or an application window. Recording
can be performed using video capture hardware devices with appropriate device
driver support.  The digital video device can also be used to capture still
image (bitmap) data from video capture hardware or previously recorded motion
video files.
<P>
This section describes digital video functions and provides examples using
media control interface string commands.
