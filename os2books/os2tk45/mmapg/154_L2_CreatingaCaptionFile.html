<H1>Creating a Caption File</H1><!-- entering slot 167 -->
<P>
The Caption Creation Utility enables synchronization of the line-by-line
display of a text file with the playing of an audio file. You can start
this program from either an OS/2 command prompt by typing<B> CAPTION</B> (while
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CAPTION subdirectory), or by selecting the Caption
Creation Utility object from the Toolkit folder. You can open an audio file,
open a text file to synchronize with it, play the audio file, and select
(by clicking a mouse button) the moment in the audio when the current line
of text should scroll to display the next line of text. This allows the
user to synchronize an audio file with a text file.

<P>
In order to start the synchronization process, the user selects<B> Start
timing</B>. The audio file begins playing and<B> Advance line</B> is enabled.
When you want to scroll to the next line of text, you select<B> Advance
line</B>.  This scrolls the line of text in the text window and displays
the next line.  When<B> Advance line</B> is selected, the Caption Creation
Utility issues an MCI_STATUS message with mciSendCommand as shown in the
following figure. The device ID passed is obtained when the application
opens the audio device. The MCI_STATUS_ITEM flag is set and the<I> ulItem
</I>field in the MCI_STATUS_PARMS data structure contains MCI_STATUS_POSITION.
 Upon return, the<I> ulReturn</I> field in the MCI_STATUS_PARMS data structure
contains the current position of the device in MMTIME units.

     case ID_NEXTLINE:
        if ( usNextline &lt; usLineCount ) /* (1) Check usNextline.   */
        {
           msp.hwndCallback = (HWND) NULL; /* (2) Get audio
                                               position.           */

           msp.ulItem     = MCI_STATUS_POSITION;
           ulError = mciSendCommand ( mop.usDeviceID,
                                      MCI_STATUS,
                                      MCI_WAIT | MCI_STATUS_ITEM,
                                      (PVOID) &amp;msp,
                                      (USHORT)  UP_STATUS );
</PRE>

<P>
When the Caption Creation Utility receives the position value, it writes
the time value and the line of text to the caption file. A caption file
contains a copy of the text file and (before each line of text) the multimedia
time unit when that line of text should be displayed in conjunction with
the audio file. The file name of the caption file is the same as the file
name of the text file, with an extension of ._CC.  The caption file can
then be used by an application in conjunction with the Caption DLL to caption
an application.
