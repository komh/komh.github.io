<P>
Ultimotion compressed frames use a coherent set of techniques for encoding
a series of images. Different techniques are used for different purposes.
Some represent detail very well while others represent large uniform areas
with only a little data, and others fall in between but are very easily
detected. Techniques can be mixed according to the needs of the image being
compressed and are organized in an efficient manner for both compression
and decompression. The result of mixing techniques is a data stream robust
enough to be generated by software both asymmetrically and symmetrically.
