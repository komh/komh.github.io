<P>
The MCI_MIX_BUFFER structure is used for reading and writing data to and
from the mixer.
<P>
Once the device is set up and memory has been allocated, the application
can use the function pointers obtained during MCI_MIXSETUP to communicate
with the mixer. During a playback operation, the application fills the buffers
with audio data and then writes the buffers to the mixer device using the
<I>pmixWrite</I> entry point. When audio data is being recorded, the mixer
device fills the buffers using the<I> pmixRead</I> entry point. Each buffer
returned the the application has a time stamp (in milliseconds) attached
so the program can determine the current time of the device.
<PRE>typedef struct_MCI_MIX_BUFFER {
  ULONG  ulStructLength;  /* Length of the structure */
  ULONG  pBuffer;         /* Pointer to a buffer */
  ULONG  ulBufferLength;  /* Length of the buffer */
  ULONG  ulFlags;         /* Flags */
  ULONG  ulUserParm;      /* User buffer parameter */
  ULONG  ulTime;          /* Device time in milliseconds */
  ULONG  ulReserved1;     /* Unused */
  ULONG  ulReserved2;     /* Unused */
  } MCI_MIX_BUFFER;
typedef MCI_MIX_BUFFER *PMCI_MIX_BUFFER
</PRE>

<P>
MCI_STOP, MCI_PAUSE, and MCI_RESUME are used to stop, pause, or resume the
audio device, respectively. MCI_STOP and MCI_PAUSE can only be sent to the
mixer device after mixRead and mixWrite have been called. MCI_RESUME will
only work after MCI_PAUSE has been sent.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> After your application has completed data transfers, issue
MCI_STOP to avoid a pause the next time the mixer device is started.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
If your application needs more precise timing information than provided
by the time stamp returned with each buffer, you can use MCI_STATUS with
the MCI_STATUS_POSITION flag to retrieve the current time of the device
in MMTIME units.
