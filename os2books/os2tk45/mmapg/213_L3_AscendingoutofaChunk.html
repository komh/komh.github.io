<H1>Ascending out of a Chunk</H1><!-- entering slot 229 -->
<P>
After you descend into a chunk and read the data in the chunk, you can move
the file position (pointer) to the beginning of the next chunk.  This is
accomplished by ascending out of the chunk using the mmioAscend function.
 The mmioAscend function specifies a pointer to an MMCKINFO structure identifying
a chunk.  The function ascends to the location following the end of this
chunk.  The return value is 0 if the operation is successful; otherwise,
the return value specifies an error code.
<P>
If the chunk was descended into using mmioDescend, then mmioAscend seeks
to the location following the end of the chunk (past the extra pad byte,
if any).
<P>
If the chunk was created and descended into using mmioCreateChunk (the MMIO_DIRTY
flag in the<I> ulFlags</I> field of<I> pckinfo</I> is set), then the current
file position is assumed to mark the end of the data portion of the chunk.
 If the chunk size is not the same as the value that was stored in<I> ckSize
</I>of<I> pckinfo</I> before mmioCreateChunk was called, then mmioAscend
seeks back and corrects the chunk size in the chunk header before ascending
from the chunk.  Also, if the chunk size is odd, then mmioAscend writes
a null pad byte at the end of the chunk.
