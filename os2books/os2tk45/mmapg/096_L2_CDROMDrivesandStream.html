<H1>CD-ROM Drives and Streaming</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
Depending on the type of CD-ROM drive installed, the audio data on a CD-DA
disc is either processed by a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) that is
built into the drive, or it is moved through the system to a Digital Signal
Processor (DSP) on an audio adapter. Some CD-ROM drives can only play CD-DA
audio data through the built-in DAC. Others, like the IBM Personal System/2
(PS/2) CD-ROM-II Drive, can play through the DAC, or they can stream data
through the audio adapter DSP.
<P>
The advantage offered by playing CD-DA through the DAC is that it is a simple
operation that greatly reduces system and resource overhead. The advantage
gained by streaming data through an audio adapter DSP is that you can potentially
enhance the signal beyond the capabilities of the DAC by adding special
effects such as reverberation and tremolo, or by modifying treble and bass-capabilities
the DAC cannot provide.
<P>
The default mode for the CD audio device is playback processed by the DAC
through the internal headphones connector.  To switch to playback through
the audio adapter DSP, the application sends the<B> connector</B> command
enabling the<I> cd stream</I> connector.

<P>
To resume playback through the internal CD DAC, the application should re-enable
the<I> headphones</I> connector.  This will automatically disable the streaming
connector.

<B>Contention for the Amplifier-Mixer Device</B>
<P>
Because the audio adapter is modeled as an amplifier-mixer (ampmix) device,
the CD audio device will automatically open and connect to its default amplifier-mixer
when streaming CD-DA data.  If the amplifier-mixer device is currently opened
exclusively by another application, enabling the cd stream connector will
fail.  If the amplifier-mixer is available, then other applications using
the same ampmix device might temporarily lose use of the device if the audio
adapter cannot simultaneously process all requests.  The Media Device Manager
(MDM) will handle all resource allocation automatically, however it should
be realized that streaming CD-DA data using the CD audio device can effect
applications using the waveaudio and sequencer devices as these devices
also use the ampmix device.  Conversely, a waveaudio device could cause
the loss of a streaming CD audio device if the waveaudio device requires
the use of the same shared ampmix device.
