<P>
This sample (AVCINST) explains how an application can install and remove
an I/O procedure to use multimedia input/output (MMIO) file services. The
AVC I/O Procedure Installation Sample is a simple PM application that allows
you to install or deinstall the audio AVC I/O procedure, AVCAPROC.DLL.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This sample shows the installation and removal of a system-defined
I/O procedure. Typically, you would install a custom I/O procedure that
was not built into the MMPMMMIO.INI file during installation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
