<P>
A cue point is a location in the media that issues an MM_MCICUEPOINT notification
message whenever it is encountered. The message is returned to the window
specified when the cue point was set. Although a cue point is specified
in the current time format with<B> setcuepoint</B>, the MM_MCICUEPOINT message
is always returned in MMTIME units. MMTIME units are used because the time
format set when the cue point is set and the time format set when the cue
point is reached may be different.  An application specific value can also
be associated with a particular cue point for return in the MM_MCICUEPOINT
message.  The value can be anything which has meaning to the application.
Generally, up to 20 cue points can be set.
<PRE>set video1 time format frames
setcuepoint video1 on at 1500 return 1
setcuepoint video1 on at 4000 return 2

<P>
An MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE notification message is issued at periodic intervals
as time elapses in the media for a particular device context. The message
is returned to the window specified when the position advise was set with
<B>setpositionadvise</B>. Only one position advise can be set for a device
context.  As with<B> setcuepoint</B>, the position specified is assumed
to be in the currently selected time format while the position reported
in the MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE notification is in MMTIME units.
<P>

<P>
Because videodisc players are external devices and not part of the computer
system, the IBM videodisc media driver can guarantee the accuracy of<B> setcuepoint
</B>and<B> setpositionadvise</B> functions only within 10 frames, rather
than the desired 100 milliseconds (3 frames) of the specified value.
