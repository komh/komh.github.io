<P>
This section gives a brief overview of the sample application programs provided
with the Toolkit, including programming concepts and program flow diagrams
for each of the sample programs.
<P>
The purpose of the OS/2 multimedia sample programs is to illustrate multimedia
programming concepts and establish a basis for creating your own multimedia
applications.  The programs provide you with practical examples that span
a range of multimedia concepts. The source code provided shows you how to
use multimedia controls and functions to create multimedia applications.
Each sample program serves as a template that can be modified easily to
meet your multimedia application requirements. The samples were compiled
and verified using the IBM C Set ++ and VisualAge C++ compilers.
<P>
Some samples require specific hardware devices. Without these devices, you
can still compile and run the sample programs; however, you might not receive
the full effect of the program.  For example, if a sample program has audio,
you will not hear it unless you have a supported audio adapter and speakers
installed.
