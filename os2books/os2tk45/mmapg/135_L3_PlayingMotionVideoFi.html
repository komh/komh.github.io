<P>
By default, playback of digital motion video is displayed in the window
supplied by the digital video device. This window is created and displayed
when the video is cued for output.
<P>
The following string commands illustrate playing an entire AVI format file.
Because<B> to</B> and<B> from</B> flags are not specified, the file is played
from the current position to the end of the file. When a motion video device
element is opened, the current position in the media is the first playable
area after any header or table of contents information.
<PRE>open movie.avi type digitalvideo alias myvideo wait
play myvideo notify
close myvideo
</PRE>

<P>
Each frame in a motion video file has a number associated with it. From
the perspective of the digital video device, each file is zero-based. That
is, the first frame is frame 0, the second frame is frame 1, and so forth.
This means the number of the last frame in a file is 1 less than the total
number of frames in the file.
<P>
The current position always indicates the frame that is<I> about</I> to
be displayed rather than the frame that is currently displayed.
<P>
When a play position is specified with the<B> from</B> flag, the actual
position reached is accurate only to the nearest intracoded frame (I-frame).
However, a position specified with the<B> to</B> flag is exact.
<P>
If you need to specify an exact position in the video file to play from,
you can issue the<B> seek</B> command, which moves the current position
in a file to an exact point. The following string commands illustrate moving
the current position to frame 20 and then playing to frame 100.
<PRE>open movie.avi type digitalvideo alias myvideo
set myvideo time format frames wait
seek myvideo to 20 wait
play myvideo to 100 notify
close myvideo
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> cue</B> command can also be used to seek and cue a particular frame.
By specifying the<B> show</B> or<B> noshow</B> flag, you can control whether
the video window will be displayed or hidden when the cue operation is performed.
This can be useful for displaying video frames as a user moves the position
slider, providing visual feedback of the location in the video a user is
seeking to.
<PRE>cue myvideo show to 20 wait
</PRE>

<P>
If a<B> to</B> position is<I> not</I> specified, the current frame is displayed
and the media position will advance by one (frame).
