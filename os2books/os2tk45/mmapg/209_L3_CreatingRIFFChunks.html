<H1>Creating RIFF Chunks</H1><!-- entering slot 225 -->
<P>
Use the mmioCreateChunk function to create a new chunk by writing a chunk
header at the current position in an open file and then "descending" into
the chunk.  (See <A HREF="211_L3_DescendingintoaChunk.html">Descending into
a Chunk</A> for further information.)  You must specify a pointer to a MMCKINFO
structure containing information about the new chunk.  You also need to
determine which chunk type to create by specifying MMIO_CREATERIFF or MMIO_CREATELIST.
 The return value is 0 if the chunk is successfully created; otherwise,
the return value specifies an error code.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment illustrates how to create a new chunk with a
chunk ID of RIFF and the form type of WAVE.
<PRE>HMMIO         hmmio;
MMCKINFO      mmckinfo;
.
.
.
mmckinfo.fccType = mmioFOURCC('W', 'A', 'V', 'E');
mmioCreateChunk(hmmio, mmckinfo, MMIO_CREATERIFF);
</PRE>

<P>
If you are creating a RIFF or LIST chunk, you must specify the form type
in the<I> fccType</I> field of the MMCKINFO structure.  In the previous
example, the form type is WAVE.
<P>
If you know the size of the data field in the new chunk, set the<I> ckSize
</I>field in the MMCKINFO structure when you create the chunk.  This value
is written to the<I> ckSize</I> field in the new chunk.  If this value is
not correct when you call mmioAscend to mark the end of the chunk, it is
automatically rewritten to reflect the correct size of the data field.
<P>
After you create a new chunk using mmioCreateChunk, the file position is
set to the data field of the chunk (8 bytes from the beginning of the chunk).
 If the chunk is a RIFF or LIST chunk, the file position is set to the location
following the form type or list type (12 bytes from the beginning of the
chunk).  The<I> ckSize</I> field is assumed to be a "proposed chunk size"
if it turns out to be correct (if you write that much data into the chunk
before calling mmioAscend to end the chunk, the mmioAscend will not have
to seek back and correct the chunk header.)
