<P>
You can seek and step to a location on the disc using any of the videodisc
time formats. Seeking is a fast-forward or fast-reverse to an absolute position.
Stepping is done, backward and forward, in time units relative to the current
position.  The default for a step is one time unit forward.

step video1 by 1

<P>
Some videodisc players do not display a picture when you do a step. You
get a "squelch" color, which is the color of the screen when a frame is
not yet displayed. Some devices, particularly for CLV, cannot be frame accurate.
