<H1>File I/O in Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 217 -->
<P>
A memory file is a block of memory that is perceived as a file by an application.
 This can be useful if you already have a file image in memory.  Memory
files let you reduce the number of special-case conditions in your code
because, for I/O purposes, you can treat file memory images as if they were
disk-based files.
<P>
Like I/O buffers, memory files can use memory allocated by the application
or by the MMIO Manager.  In addition, memory files can be expandable or
non-expandable.
<P>
Memory is expandable when the system allocates an internal buffer using
the MMIO_ALLOCBUF flag of the mmioOpen function.  When the MMIO Manager
reaches the end of an expandable memory file, it expands the memory file
by a predefined increment.
<P>
Use the mmioOpen function to open a memory file.  Specify NULL for the<I> szFileName
</I>parameter and the MMIO_READWRITE flag, as shown:
<PRE>hmmio = mmioOpen(NULL, &amp;mmioinfo, MMIO_READWRITE);
</PRE>

<P>
In addition, set the<I> pmmioinfo</I> parameter to point to an MMIOINFO
structure set up as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the<I> pIOProc</I> field to NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the<I> fccIOProc</I> field to FOURCC_MEM.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the<I> pchBuffer</I> field to point to the memory
block.  To request that the MMIO Manager allocate the memory block, set
<I>pchBuffer</I> to NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the<I> cchBuffer</I> field to the initial size
of the memory block.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the<I> aulInfo</I>[0] field to the minimum expansion
size of the memory block.  For a non-expandable memory file, set<I> aulInfo</I>[0]
to NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set all other fields to 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to open a memory file using a buffer
named achMyBuffer.
<PRE>        /* set mmioinfo structure to 0 */        mmioinfo.fccIOProc= FOURCC_MEM
        mmioinfo.pchBuffer= achMyBuffer
        mmioinfo.cchBuffer= cchMyBuffer
hmmio = mmioOpen("NULL", &amp;mmioinfo, 0);
</PRE>

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to open a memory file with 1 byte
initially and expand up to 1KB as required.
<PRE>        /* set mmioinfo structure to 0 */
        mmioinfo.fccIOProc= FOURCC_MEM
        mmioinfo.pchBuffer= NULL
        mmioinfo.cchBuffer= 1
        mmioinfo.aulInfo[0] = 1024;
hmmio = mmioOpen("NULL", &amp;mmioinfo, MMIO_CREATE)
</PRE>

<P>
Allocating Memory for Memory Files
<P>
There are no restrictions on allocating memory for use as a non-expandable
memory file.  You can use static memory or stack memory, or you can use
locally allocated or globally allocated memory.
