<P>
The graphic button PM window class WC_GRAPHICBUTTON is similar to the window
class of a push button. This window class must be registered with the function
WinRegisterGraphicButton before you can create a graphic button.
<P>
A graphic button can be created by a CONTROL statement in a dialog resource.
A graphic button also can be created by specifying the WC_GRAPHICBUTTON
window class parameter of the WinCreateWindow call.
<P>
The graphic button should be initialized when its owner receives a WM_INITDLG
message. By doing the initializations at this time, the owner has the capability
to change the graphic button's bitmaps, text positioning, state, animation
rate, and so on, before the button is displayed on the screen.
<P>
The GBTNCDATA data structure shown below is the data structure that is allocated
to initialize graphic button control data. This structure is required when
sending the GBM_SETGRAPHICDATA message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you create a graphic button with WinCreateWindow and initialize
the GBTNCDATA structure; set the<I> usReserved</I> field to GB_STRUCTURE,
rather than GB_RESOURCE, to indicate the structure contains a module handle.

<PRE>      typedef struct _GBTNCDATA
      {
         USHORT  usReserved;   /* Reserved                       */
         PSZ     pszText;      /* Initial graphic button text    */
         HMODULE hmod;         /* Handle of bitmap resource      */
         USHORT  cBitmaps;     /* Number of button bitmaps       */
         USHORT  aidBitmap[1]; /* Array of bitmap resource IDs   */
      } GBTNCDATA;

</PRE>

<P>
Graphic button data is set or changed by sending the GBM_SETGRAPHICDATA
message with WinSendMsg to the graphic button control window procedure.
Using this message to change graphic button data erases any data relating
to the button state and sets the button state to the default parameters.
The default state of a graphic button is "up." If you want to change only
the text of the graphic button without affecting the button state data,
use WinSetWindowText.
<P>
Mnemonics are supported for graphic button text. As with push buttons, a
character in the text is designated as the mnemonic for the button by a
preceding tilde (~) character. If the button does not have any text, a null
string must be specified.
<P>
The number specified for bitmaps associated with the graphic button does
not necessarily represent the number of<I> unique</I> bitmaps. A graphic
button can have duplicate bitmaps associated with it for animation purposes.

<P>
It is assumed that all the bitmaps associated with a particular graphic
button are of equal size.  The size of a graphic button is determined by
the dimensions specified in the CONTROL statement of the dialog resource,
as well as the size of the bitmap.  If the dimensions in the CONTROL statement
are too small to contain the bitmap and the text, the button size is made
larger to accommodate the width of the bitmap and the depth of the bitmap
plus the text.  However, if the width of the text exceeds the width determined
by the specified dimensions or the actual bitmap (whichever is greater),
the text is truncated.
