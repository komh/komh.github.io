<H1>DOUBPLAY - Double Buffering Playlist Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 264 -->
<P>
DOUBPLAY allows an application to play audio files directly from application
memory buffers. An array of multiple playlist structures can be constructed
that combines playlist commands with data buffers to perform complex operations
on multiple buffers.
<P>
This sample takes a single wave file, MYWAVE.WAV, and plays it using a memory
playlist. The playlist is constructed as a circular buffer composed of a
series of small buffers, the sum of which may or may not be larger than
the size of the .WAV file. This circular buffer is used to repeatedly play
an audio file when the PLAY button is selected. As each buffer in the playlist
is expended, the application refills the expended buffer with new data from
the .WAV file. When all the buffers in the playlist have been expended,
the playlist branches back to the first buffer to play the new data. This
circular buffering process continues until the STOP button is selected or
the application is closed.
