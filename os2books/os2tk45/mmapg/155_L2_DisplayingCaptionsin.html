<P>
The Caption DLL works with an application to display caption files in the
requesting application's window. The DLL does all of the work to display
the text window and scroll the text in synchronization with the appropriate
audio file. Applications can utilize this DLL to display captioned text
(in synchronization with an audio file) in their application's window.  To
perform this function, the Caption DLL utilizes the captioned text files,
created by the Caption Creation Utility, and position advise messages that
it sets on the specified audio device.  As described earlier, the caption
files contain an MMTIME unit before every line of text.  The Caption DLL
requests position advise messages from the Media Device Manager (MDM) every
1500 MMTIME units on the specified device.  When it receives MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE
messages from MDM, it examines the MMTIME units in front of the text lines
and displays the correct line of text in the text window of the application.
The maximum size of the caption file is 500 lines long, but this can be
modified by changing the limit in the Caption DLL source code. This DLL
supports the following functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
