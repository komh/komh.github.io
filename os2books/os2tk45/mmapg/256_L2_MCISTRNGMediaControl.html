<H1>MCISTRNG - Media Control Interface String Test Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 272 -->
<P>
The String Test Sample serves as a powerful testing and debugging tool that
enables developers writing media drivers to control their devices at the
application level.  The String Test Sample illustrates how an application
uses the interpretive string interface provided by the media control interface.
 It also illustrates how notification messages are returned from the media
drivers to the application.
<P>
The media control interface of OS/2 multimedia provides the primary mechanism
for application control of media devices.  Applications interface with the
media control interface (and thus with media devices) in two ways-through
a procedural interface or through a string interface.  The procedural interface
(also referred to as command message interface) is used for sending messages
to the media control interface from an application using the mciSendCommand
function.  The string interface is used for sending command language statements
to the media control interface from an application using the mciSendString
function.
<P>
The string interface has a few advantages over the procedural interface.
 First, the string interface enables you to interactively control devices
with a PM or command line interface.  In addition, applications that currently
use script languages can integrate "string commands" in their script languages
allowing you to integrate multimedia in your applications with a very low
cost and development impact.  Finally, in certain programming circumstances,
the string interface is also easier to use than the procedural interface.
 The string interface simply passes a character-string buffer to the function,
in contrast to the procedural interface, which requires the setup of certain
data structures.
