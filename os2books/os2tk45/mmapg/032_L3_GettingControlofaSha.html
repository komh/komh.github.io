<P>
The MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message sent with WinPostMsg by the multimedia system
to applications and the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message sent by applications with
mciSendCommand to the multimedia system provide a device-sharing scheme
for the OS/2 multimedia environment.
<P>
To participate in device sharing, an application issues MCI_OPEN with the
MCI_OPEN_SHAREABLE flag set. The system then attempts to acquire the device
for the application. The application must wait until it receives the asynchronous
MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message to gain control of the device.  The multimedia
system sends the MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message to inform the application that
the device context is becoming active (MCI_GAINING_USE).
<P>
Before an application receives an MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message with an event
of MCI_GAINING_USE, it can make inquiries about the device and the media.
MCI_STATUS, MCI_GETDEVCAPS, MCI_INFO, and MCI_CLOSE commands can be sent
to an inactive device context.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If your application has set an MCI_NOTIFY flag on the open
request, notification will be posted to the application before the MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
message is sent.  However, if the application message queue has other messages
already queued, it is possible that the application may receive the MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
message before it receives the notification message.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
The active instance of the application remains active until the application
returns from the WinPostMsg (MCI_LOSING_USE). This guarantees that the application
has an active device context until it returns from WinPostMsg. If the application
receives an MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message with an event of MCI_GAINING_USE, it
should return immediately. The following code fragment illustrates the device
sharing architecture from the Clock Sample program.
<PRE>  /*
   * The next two messages are handled so that the Clock application
   * can participate in device sharing.  Because it opens the devices
   * as shareable devices, other applications can gain control of the
   * devices.  When this happens, we will receive a pass device
   * message.  We keep track of this device passing in the fPassed
   * boolean variable.
   * If we do not have access to the device when we receive an
   * activate message, then we will issue an acquire device command
   * to gain access to the device.
   */

case MM_MCIPASSDEVICE:
   if (SHORT1FROMMP(mp2) == MCI_GAINING_USE)
   {
      fPassed = FALSE;               /* Gaining control of device   */
   } else
   {
      fPassed = TRUE;                /* Losing control of device    */
   }
   return( WinDefSecondaryWindowProc( hwnd, msg, mp1, mp2 ) );

case WM_ACTIVATE:

   /* We use the WM_ACTIVATE message to participate in device sharing.
    * We first check to see if this is an activate or a deactivate
    * message (indicated by mp1). Then, we check to see if we've
    * passed control of the device that we use.  If these conditions
    * are true, we issue an acquire device command to regain
    * control of the device, because we're now the active window on
    * the screen.
    *
    * This is one possible method that can be used to implement
    * device sharing. For applications that are more complex
    * than this sample program, developers may wish to take
    * advantage of a more robust method of device sharing.
    * This can be done by using the MCI_ACQUIRE_QUEUE flag on
    * the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE command.

   /*
    * First we check to see if we've passed control of the device

 return( WinDefSecondaryWindowProc( hwnd, msg, mp1, mp2 ) );

<P>
<B>Regaining Control of a Shared Device</B>
<P>
An application regains control of a shared device by issuing the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE
message with mciSendCommand after it has received a WM_ACTIVATE message.
The application receives a WM_ACTIVATE message whenever its frame window
is activated or deactivated by user selection. The time for the application
to regain control of a shared device is during the period its window is
activated. A "greedy" application that grabs back a device as soon as it
loses it defeats the purpose of the WM_ACTIVATE message processing scheme,
which is to give control of a shared device to the application with which
the user is interacting.
<P>
Only dynamic single-context and limited multiple-context devices are acquired
by applications. The MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE function does not perform any function
for fixed single-context and unlimited-context devices, because device contexts
are not saved or restored for these classes of devices.
<P>
To better understand the allocation of resources to multiple device contexts,
imagine a stack of device contexts. The physical device is associated with
the topmost device context on the stack.  Whenever a device context is opened,
it is placed on top of the stack, and the physical device is associated
with the new device context. When MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE is issued for a particular
device context, that device context moves to the top of the stack, and the
physical device is associated with the existing device context. Closing
a device context removes it from the stack.
<P>
<B>Queued Acquire Command</B>
<P>
Setting the MCI_ACQUIRE_QUEUE flag of the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message enables
the message to be queued and executed as soon as device resources become
available.  An application can issue an MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message and, at
a later point, the device context becomes active.  This is true if either
the MCI_NOTIFY or MCI_WAIT flag is specified.  If the MCI_WAIT flag is specified,
the calling thread is blocked until the device context becomes active. If
the MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE request can be satisfied immediately, the command
is not queued.
<P>
The<B> acquire</B> command can be used to acquire a device instance when
the resource becomes available:
<PRE>open music1.wave alias wave1 shareable wait
play wave1 notify
.
.
.
** <B>During this time a losing use message is received</B> **
** <B>and this instance becomes inactive.</B>               **
.
.
.
acquire wave1 queue notify
</PRE>

<P>
If an MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE is queued and an application issues MCI_RELEASEDEVICE
or MCI_CLOSE for that instance, the queued MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message is
canceled.
<P>
<B>Releasing the Resource</B>
<P>
The release resource command is used in conjunction with the queued acquire
command. An application can release a device instance from the active state
and make the next available inactive device instance active by setting the
MCI_RETURN_RESOURCE flag of the MCI_RELEASEDEVICE message.  When a device
instance no longer needs its resources, the device instance can give up
the resource to another device requesting the resources (with MCI_ACQUIRE_QUEUE).

<P>
The<B> release</B> command as shown in the following example can be used
to release exclusive hold on a device.
<PRE>open waveaudio alias wave2 shareable wait
acquire wave2 exclusive wait
record wave2 notify
.
.
.
** <B>Open the device exclusively to avoid interruptions</B> **
** <B>during recording.</B>                                  **
.
.
.
stop wave2 wait
release wave2 return resource wait
</PRE>

<P>
The device instance will not be made active again unless an application
issues an MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE message for this device context. This function
is ignored if the instance is already in an inactive state.  The instance
remains active if the resource used by this instance is not required by
any other instance.
