<P>
A mixed format compact disc holds CD-ROM file system data as well as CD-DA
track format data.  An example of the use of a mixed format disc is an application
that contains several symphonies by a famous composer. The actual audio
is stored as a series of CD-DA tracks. Also stored on the disc (but in CD-ROM
file format) is a program, the actual music score, and perhaps a data base
on the composer's life. When the application is started, the audio from
a symphony can be played using the CD audio media driver, while the user
is allowed to study the music score. Additionally, the user might retrieve
facts on the composer, such as how old the composer was when the symphony
was written.
<P>
By issuing the MCI_GETTOC message with mciSendCommand, an application can
retrieve a table of contents (TOC) for a disc. This function is particularly
useful for a mixed format disc. The starting and ending addresses (time)
of each audio track are listed as well as the type of track.  Using the
table of contents, an application can immediately determine which tracks
can be played using the CD audio device.  Additionally, an application can
determine the track type by issuing the<B> status</B> command to determine
the type of any individual track.
