<P>
The videodisc media device supports Pioneer models 4200, 4300D, 4400, and
8000. The 4300D supports both the American (NTSC) and European (PAL) TV
standards for storing analog video signals. Default communications settings
for the players are:  8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit with a baud rate
of 4800.  The first communications port is also selected by default. These
settings may be changed using the Multimedia Setup application if they do
not match the current settings of the actual videodisc device.  It is highly
recommended that communication speeds at or above 4800 bits per second (bps)
be utilized to ensure reliable and optimized performance.
<P>
Because the physical connections on the back of each videodisc device varies,
the driver updates the connector and product information when the device
is first opened. Applications can retrieve connector information, using
MCI_CONNECTORINFO, and product information, using MCI_INFO.
