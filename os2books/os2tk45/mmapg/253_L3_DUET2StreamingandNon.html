<H1>DUET2 - Streaming and Non-Streaming Device Duet Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 269 -->
<P>
Code for the Streaming and Non-Streaming Device Duet Sample (DUET2) is almost
identical to DUET1.  The difference is that DUET2 demonstrates how one of
the devices in the multimedia device group can be a non-streaming device.
 The song in DUET2 is divided in two parts, just as the song in DUET1.  However,
DUET2 plays one part of the song from a CD in a CD-ROM device connected
to the system.  This difference in hardware is almost totally isolated from
the application.  There is a difference of approximately 10 lines of code
between the Duet sample programs to handle the major difference in hardware
configurations.
<P>
This major difference in hardware configuration is buffered from DUET2 by
the media drivers. The CD Media Driver performs differently from the Waveform
Audio Media Driver because it is dealing with a non-streaming device.  When
the CD media driver receives a media control interface message from the
program (such as PLAY or STOP), it must communicate with the CD-ROM device
driver through the IOCtl interface. This is the difference between a media
driver that controls a streaming device and a media driver that controls
a non-streaming device.
