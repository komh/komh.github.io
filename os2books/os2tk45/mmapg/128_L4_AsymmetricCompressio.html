<P>
The Ultimotion compression techniques used during offline or asymmetric
video recording take more time during the compression phase than it takes
to decompress the video when the movie is played.  By spending more time
on compression, these techniques produce higher quality images and can compress
the video data more effectively. Ultimotion asymmetric compression techniques
produce movies stored using 320 x 240 resolution, 15 frame per second, and
can be played from a CD.  Movies made with these specifications require
9MB per minute. Reducing either the resolution, frame rate, or quality setting
reduces the amount of storage required.  Increasing these specifications
require faster storage devices (for example, double speed CD-ROM or hard
disk) and faster playback systems.
