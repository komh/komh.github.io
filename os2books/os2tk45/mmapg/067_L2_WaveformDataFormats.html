<H1>Waveform Data Formats</H1><!-- entering slot 75 -->
<P>
There are several formats used for storing waveform data within a computer
system.  OS/2 multimedia recognizes several resolutions of the Pulse Code
Modulation (PCM) format, because it is supported by most audio adapters.
OS/2 multimedia also recognizes ADPCM formats. Refer to the Appendix of
the<I> OS/2 Multimedia Programming Reference</I> for descriptions of these
formats.
<P>
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) refers to the variation of a digital signal
to represent audio amplitude. This method of assigning binary values to
amplitude levels supports the conversion of analog signals to digital signals
by adapters such as the M-Audio Capture and Playback Adapter.
<P>
Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) is a technique for compressing
waveform samples. ADPCM can reduce the amount of data storage required by
a factor of 16 to 1, but some price is paid in fidelity for the higher compression
rates.
