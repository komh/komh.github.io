<P>
A specific device can have file extensions and .TYPE EAs (Extended Attributes)
associated with it. The OS/2 multimedia user can map a file extension or
.TYPE EA to a specific device with the Multimedia Setup application located
in the Multimedia folder. An OS/2 multimedia subsystem developer writing
an installation DLL can map a file extension or .TYPE EA to a device using
MCI_SYSINFO_SET_EXTENSIONS or MCI_SYSINFO_SET_TYPES. For an extension or
.TYPE EA to be mapped to a device, it must be unique across installation
names.
<P>
For example, the Multimedia Setup application can be used to associate the
WAV extension with the waveaudio01 device. The device can then be opened
by passing the name of a data element with a WAV extension as a parameter
in the open command to mciSendString. Suppose the following string is passed:

<PRE>open honk.wav wait
</PRE>

<P>
The waveaudio01 device is opened with the data file honk.wav.
