<H1>A Connector Example Using the IBM M-Audio Adapter</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
The following figure illustrates how the capabilities of an audio card might
be modeled as an OS/2 amplifier-mixer device using connectors.  This example
uses the IBM M-Audio Capture and Playback Adapter, however a model can easily
be defined for any manufacturer's audio card.  The number and type of connectors
may vary.

In this particular model, the<I> speakers(1)</I> connector is the default
<I>speakers</I> connector and represents the physical speaker jack on the
M-Audio card.  The<I> speakers(2)</I> connector represents the internal
connection to the PC speaker.  The<I> amp stream</I> connector represents
the flow of digital information to and from the audio card.
