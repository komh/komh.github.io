<P>
The MCI_OPEN message is issued to create a device context of the digital
video device. A default window is created and displayed when the device
is opened if the device is cued for output or a movie is loaded. The video
device directs its output to the default window. If a window is specified
with the MCI_WINDOW message the video device directs its output to the window
specified. For the convenience of applications that are using the string
interface, some window-style control functions are also exported as flags
to the MCI_WINDOW message.
<P>
Whether the default window or an application-defined window is used for
output, the digital video device confines its output to the device coordinates
of the specified window.
<P>
The default video window is invisible when the device is first opened. This
allows the user or application to prepare the size, position, and contents
of the window before it is displayed. It is created in a frame window, which
can be sized, moved, maximized, and minimized. It is also created with an
ideal aspect ratio in the center of the display and occupies approximately
one quarter of the screen. As the user changes the size of the window, the
digital video device scales the video image as required to maintain the
video within the current coordinates. Maintaining a constant aspect ratio
is the responsibility of the application program.
<P>
The parent of the default video window is HWND_DESKTOP unless otherwise
specified in the MCI_OPEN message. The owner of the default video window
is NULL. An application can specify a parent window handle for the default
video window using<I> hwndParent</I> when the device is opened. This is
the only window-related parameter that can be specified using media control
interface commands that changes the behavior of the default video window.
