<H1>Creating a Waveform Playlist</H1><!-- entering slot 83 -->
<P>
Specialized applications such as a waveform editor might require the capability
of playing and recording using application memory buffers instead of files.
 The<I> memory playlist</I> feature of OS/2 multimedia provides the construct
for supplying memory buffers to the waveaudio device.  Besides implementing
simple circular buffering schemes, memory playlists can be used to synthesize
complex and unique waveform sounds. By following each DATA statement with
a MESSAGE statement, an application can be informed as to when the buffer
can be reused.
<P>
<B>Playlist Structure</B>
<P>
Depending on the complexity of the application, memory playlists can be
used to provide a single large memory buffer, or multiple buffers in a circular
buffering scheme. The following is an example of how a memory playlist might
be constructed to implement a simple circular buffering scheme.
<PRE>    0:    NOP
    1:    DATA...
    2:    MESSAGE...
    3:    DATA...
    4:    MESSAGE...
    5:    DATA...
    6:    MESSAGE...
    7:    BRANCH 0
</PRE>

<P>
Note that regardless of whether the playlist is being used for play or record
operations, the MESSAGE instruction will notify the application when the
playlist processor has consumed or filled the preceding DATA buffer.  An
MM_MCIPLAYLISTMESSAGE will be sent to the window procedure specified when
the waveaudio device was originally opened.
<P>
The following code fragment shows the SetUpPlaylist procedure that is performed
once, during initialization of the Clock Sample program.  It calls the procedure
CopyWaveformIntoMemory to copy the waveform files into memory buffers.  It
also initializes the playlist data structure by supplying the address and
size of the memory buffers holding the data in the appropriate data structure
fields.
