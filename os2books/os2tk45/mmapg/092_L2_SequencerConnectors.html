<P>
The sequencer device directly supports one<I> MIDI stream</I> connector
that is always enabled.  As it is likely that an application will need to
select the output destination on the amplifier-mixer device, the sequencer
device will attempt to provide the following connector services to an application.
 If the requested connector is not available, the command will fail.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Additional connectors may be available on the ampmix device.  To control
these connectors, obtain the device ID of the ampmix device using the MCI_CONNECTION
message and issue the connector command directly to the associated amplifier-mixer.

<P>
To determine which connectors are supported by an amplifier-mixer device,
use the MCI_CONNECTORINFO message.
