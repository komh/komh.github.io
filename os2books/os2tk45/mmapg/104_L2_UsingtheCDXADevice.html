<P>
When an MCI_OPEN or MCI_LOAD request is made, it is recommended that a drive
letter not be included as part of the element name. If a drive letter is
specified, it must match the drive letter of the open device; otherwise,
the error MCI_FILE_NOT_FOUND is returned.
<P>
<B>Setting Up the Primary Stream</B>
<P>
The first stream is set up by calling MCI_SET with one of the four target
specifications:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_BUFFER<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
MCI_CDXA_VIDEO_BUFFER<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
MCI_CDXA_DATA_BUFFER<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The first stream to be set up is called the<I> primary</I> stream, because
it controls much of the operation of the CD-XA device. When stream control
operations are done on the CD-XA media device, they are done to the primary
stream.  For example, when an MCI_SEEK is done, only the primary stream
is seeked. This makes sense because the media is the same for all streams,
and seeking one of the streams affects the disc position for all the other
streams.
<P>
Because the primary stream is the control focus for the entire device, if
an MCI_SET is done while the MCI_SET_OFF flag is in effect for the primary
stream, the device is stopped. If the MCI_SET is done on a secondary stream,
only that secondary stream is stopped.
<P>
If an MCI_SET with MCI_SET_ON is not done before an MCI_PLAY, MCI_CUE, or
MCI_SEEK is sent, the first audio channel found on the CD-XA file is used
as the default and is set up as the primary stream using the MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE.
It is recommended that an MCI_SET be sent for the primary stream before
an MCI_PLAY, MCI_CUE or MCI_SEEK. It is also recommended that MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE
be used as the primary stream, because seeking and playing with FROM and
TO positions specified can only be done on a stream to an audio device.
The video, data and audio buffers do not have seek or time capability.  When
CD-XA data types are streamed to memory playlists, this operation is done
as a data transport and does not have a real timing aspect associated with
it.  For example, if an MCI_SET with an MCI_CDXA_DATA_BUFFER stream was
set as the primary stream, a seek or a status position to an MMTIME unit
or millisecond does not make sense, because there is no correlation of time
to the data volumes.
<P>
When an MCI_SET with MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE is done, the audio quality level
is set by the media device, based on the quality level found in the first
sector.  The audio quality level must be constant within a channel within
a single file when streamed to an audio device. The current CD-XA software
does not detect any deviations that occur. If the quality level changes
in a channel, the output audio may be garbled and the stream time will be
inaccurate.
<P>
If the channel associated with the primary stream is set off and a PLAY
command is received, the error MCIERR_CHANNEL_OFF will be returned.
<P>
The valid range for audio channels is 0-15.  The valid range for video and
data channels is 0-31.  These ranges are defined by CD-XA specifications.
 MCIERR_OUTOFRANGE is returned if the channel specified on the MCI_SET is
outside the range.
<P>
The channel assigned to a secondary target specification (MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE,
MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_BUFFER, MCI_CDXA_VIDEO_BUFFER, or MCI_CDXA_DATA_BUFFER) can
be changed without closing the CD-XA media device.  To do this, your application
calls MCI_SET with the MCI_SET_OFF flag for that channel and then calls
MCI_SET with the MCI_SET_ON flag and the new channel number.  If MCI_SET
with the MCI_SET_ON flag is called for a target specification already in
use, MCIERR_RESOURCE_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned if the system or underlying
hardware cannot support the additional resource demands.
<P>
The channel assigned to the primary target specification can be changed
just like a secondary one can. For example, a series of MCI_SET commands
could be made, specifying the following parameter sequences:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE channel 0 MCI_SET_ON<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE
channel 0 MCI_SET_OFF<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE channel 1 MCI_SET_ON<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The MCI_SET commands would change the channel of the MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE
from 0 to 1.
