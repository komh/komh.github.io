<P>
The CD-XA media device can play four streams of CD-XA data types simultaneously
from the same CD-XA file. CD-XA data streams are set up by specifying the
following flags with MCI_SET:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Flag</B><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL><B> CD-XA Stream Data Type</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_DEVICE
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>CD-XA audio channel to an audio adapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_BUFFER
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>CD-XA audio channel to an audio memory playlist.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>MCI_CDXA_VIDEO_BUFFER<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> CD-XA
video channel to a video memory playlist.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MCI_CDXA_DATA_BUFFER
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>CD-XA data channel to a data memory playlist.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In the future IBM may provide the capability of setting up additional streams
to more than one audio device, or more than one audio, video, or data buffer
playlist.
<P>
If a channel contains data of more than one CD-XA data type (data and video),
and an MCI_SET is done, only data of the type specified is returned.  For
example, suppose an MCI_SET message is sent with MCI_CDXA_VIDEO_BUFFER,
channel 0, and a playlist specified. Although channel 0 contains sectors
of both audio and video, only the video sectors are sent to the memory playlist
buffers specified with the MCI_SET. If your application wants to retrieve
the audio sectors from channel 0, it must do another MCI_SET, this time
specifying MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_BUFFER, channel 0, and a playlist that is different
from the one specified for the video data. The audio would then be sent
to the playlist specified for MCI_CDXA_AUDIO_BUFFER, and the video sectors
would be sent to the playlist specified for MCI_CDXA_VIDEO_BUFFER.
