<H1>Animated Graphic Button</H1><!-- entering slot 177 -->
<P>
The following code fragment is a sample definition for creating an animated
graphic button with a CONTROL statement in a dialog resource.
<PRE>CONTROL "", IDD_TESTPLAY1, 120, 70, 45, 35,
            WC_GRAPHICBUTTON,
            GBS_AUTOANIMATION | GBS_3D_TEXTRAISED |
            WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP
            CTLDATA GB_RESOURCE, "PLAY", 16, ID_PLAY1, ID_PLAY 2, ID_PLAY3,
                                           ID_PLAY4,  ID_PLAY5,  ID_PLAY6,
                                           ID_PLAY7,  ID_PLAY8,  ID_PLAY9,
                                           ID_PLAY10, ID_PLAY11, ID_PLAY12,
                                           ID_PLAY13, ID_PLAY14, ID_PLAY15,
                                           ID_PLAY16, 0
</PRE>

<P>
The control data for the graphic button provides the text "PLAY" (with no
mnemonic) for the button face and associates the names of 16 bitmaps with
the button. The bitmaps are assigned indexes 1 through 16, according to
the order they appear in the control data.
<P>
The list of bitmap IDs is preceded by a number and ends with a zero. The
number indicates the total of defined bitmaps. The zero indicates the end
of the bitmap array. The number of bitmaps that actually are displayed is
determined by the bitmap total or the zero-terminated array, whichever is
less.  If the number of bitmap IDs is greater than the bitmap total, the
extraneous bitmap IDs are ignored.  A bitmap cannot have an ID of zero.

<P>
Because the style of this graphic button includes GBS_AUTOANIMATION, when
the user clicks on this button, it automatically toggles the animation on
or off without intervention from the owner window of the graphic button.

<P>
An animated graphic button can also be created by specifying the WS_GRAPHICBUTTON
window class name as a parameter of the WinCreateWindow call. The following
code fragment shows an example of setting up the GBTNCDATA structure with
the graphic button data and using the WinCreateWindow call.
<PRE>HWND        hwndGB;        /* Graphic button window handle   */
PGBTNCDATA  pgbtn;         /* Pointer to graphic button data */
LONG        lSize;         /* Size of graphic data           */
#define NUMBITMAPS   4     /* Number of bitmaps for button   */

lSize = sizeof(GBTNCDATA) + sizeof(USHORT) * (NUMBITMAPS - 1);
pgbtn = (PGBTNCDATA)malloc(lSize);

if (pgbtn)
 {
  memset(pgbtn, 0, lSize);

  pgbtnpszText     = "Text";
  pgbtncBitmaps    = NUMBITMAPS;
  pgbtnaidBitmap[0] = BMP0;
  pgbtnaidBitmap[1] = BMP1;
  pgbtnaidBitmap[2] = BMP2;
  pgbtnaidBitmap[3] = BMP3;

  WinRegisterGraphicButton();

  /* Create the graphic button.  hwnd is the window handle
   * of the owning window (for example, client window)
   */

   hwndGB = WinCreateWindow (hwnd,
     WC_GRAPHICBUTTON,
     "",               /* No text here; see pgbtnpszText */
     WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP | WS_POINTSELECT |
     GBS_AUTOANIMATION | GBS_3D_TEXTRECESSED,
     0,0,80,40,
     hwnd,
     HWND_TOP,
     ID_GB,            /* Graphic button identifier */
     MPFROMP(pgbtn),
     NULL);

  WinSendMsg( hwndGB, GBM_SETGRAPHICDATA, MPFROMP(pgbtn), 0);
}
