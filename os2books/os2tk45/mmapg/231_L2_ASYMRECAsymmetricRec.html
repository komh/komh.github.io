<H1>ASYMREC - Asymmetric Recording Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 247 -->
<P>
This sample (ASYMREC) illustrates how to include asymmetric recording function
in your multimedia application.  Modules include source code extracted from
the Video IN Recorder application, which enables frame-step recording using
Ultimotion compression techniques.
<P>
Frame-step recording captures the audio and video in a two-pass operation.
First, it captures the audio in real time. It then returns to the point
in the media where recording started to capture the video frame by frame.
