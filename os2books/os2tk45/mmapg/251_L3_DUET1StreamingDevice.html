<H1>DUET1 - Streaming Device Duet Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 267 -->
<P>
The Streaming Device Duet Sample (DUET1) illustrates the concepts of grouping
two streaming devices. Each song that is played by DUET1 is recorded into
two separate waveform files (instead of a single waveform file, which is
the most common and efficient means to record).  Think of each song as a
duet, with each part of the duet stored in a separate waveform file.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The DUET1 program will not execute correctly when using a
Sound Blaster adapter because the adapter does not support playing two wave
files simultaneously.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
