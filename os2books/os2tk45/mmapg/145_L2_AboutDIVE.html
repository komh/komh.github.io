<H1>About DIVE</H1><!-- entering slot 156 -->
<P>
DIVE is a DLL that provides optimized blitting performance for motion video
subsystems and applications that perform rapid screen updates in the OS/2
PM and full-screen environments. Using DIVE functions, applications can
either write directly to video memory or use the DIVE blitter to get a high
level of screen update performance, image scaling, color space conversion,
and bank-switch display support. The DIVE blitter utilizes acceleration
hardware when present and applicable to the function being performed.
