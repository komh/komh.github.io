The Movie Sample (MOVIE) demonstrates device control of a software motion
video device. It also illustrates how to cut, copy, paste, and delete movie
data from an application. A movie can be played in an application-defined
window or in the system default window provided by the software motion video
subsystem. The Movie Sample program uses the string interface to interact
with the media control interface layer.
