<H1>CLOCK - Memory Playlist Sample</H1><!-- entering slot 261 -->
<P>
The Memory Playlist Sample (CLOCK) illustrates the use of the memory playlist
feature of OS/2 multimedia. The memory playlist feature provides for easy
manipulation of multimedia data in memory to create unique effects based
on user input or other dynamic events. In the case of the Memory Playlist
Sample, multimedia data is manipulated dynamically to create sound effects
(chimes) based on the time. The sample program also illustrates the use
of the captioning flag provided by OS/2 multimedia. The Memory Playlist
Sample uses this flag to decide if it should provide users with a visual
cue of chimes.
