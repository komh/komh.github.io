<P>
A videodisc has one of two formats:  CAV or CLV.
<P>
CAV (constant angular velocity) is the interactive format of videodiscs,
which allows freeze frame and slow motion. The CAV videodisc can be addressed
by chapter or by frame. A CAV videodisc can contain up to 30 minutes of
video on each side of the disc. One disc holds up to 54,000 frames.
<P>
With a CAV format videodisc, the angular velocity of the disc is always
the same (1800 RPM), no matter what track is being read, which is similar
to the way a phonograph record is played.
<P>
CLV (constant linear velocity) is the format for extended-play videodiscs.
The CLV videodisc can be addressed by chapter or by time. A CLV videodisc
can contain up to 60 minutes of video on each side of the disc.
<P>
With a CLV format videodisc, the linear velocity of the disc is constant
under the laser head; the disc spins slower when the outside tracks are
read.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The number of chapters on CAV and CLV discs varies, depending
on the manufacturer of the disc.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
