<P>
OS/2 multimedia (referred to as MMPM/2 or Multimedia Presentation Manager/2
in previous releases) is the multimedia platform for today because it takes
advantage of OS/2 features to provide an effective multimedia environment.
OS/2 multitasking capability supports synchronization and concurrent playback
of multiple devices. The flat memory model supports the management of large
data objects.
<P>
OS/2 multimedia is also the multimedia platform for tomorrow because of
its extendable architecture, which enables new functions, devices, and multimedia
data types to be added as the technology of multimedia advances.
<P>
Because OS/2 multimedia and its devices are designed to support synchronization
activities, Presentation Manager (PM) applications can easily incorporate
multimedia function for playing multiple devices concurrently and synchronizing
audio and video as media drivers become available.
