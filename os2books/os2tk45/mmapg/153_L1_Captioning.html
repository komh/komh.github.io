The Toolkit provides a sample captioning system to assist application programmers
in adding captioning to multimedia applications. The sample captioning system
consists of three parts: the Caption Creation Utility program, Caption DLL,
and Caption Sample Application.  The Caption Creation Utility program (located
in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CAPTION subdirectory) creates a "caption" file.  This
is a text file containing timing information relating to its associated
audio file.  The Caption DLL (located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CAPDLL
directory) provides functions that drive the display and management of the
caption file in a "caption window" in a PM application. The Caption Sample
Application (located in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CAPSAMP subdirectory) demonstrates
how an application uses the functions provided by the Caption DLL to take
advantage of its services.  As with all OS/2 multimedia samples, the source
code is provided for all three components.  You can use the three components
as provided or modify them to meet specific requirements. See <A HREF="229_L1_SampleApplicationPro.html">Sample
Application Programs</A> for more information on the captioning components.
