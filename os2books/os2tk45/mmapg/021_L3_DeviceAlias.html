<P>
When a device is opened, it can be given an alias, or alternate name. The
primary use of a device alias is to simplify the specifying of subsequent
commands to control the device through the string interface. A device alias
is referenced only from the string interface, and it is valid only within
the process that opened the device context.
<P>
For example, the following strings can be passed with mciSendString:
<PRE>open horns.wav alias honk
play honk
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
A secondary use of the device alias is to differentiate between device contexts
opened by the same process. For example:
<PRE>open horns.wav alias honk
open bells.wav alias ring
play ring wait
play honk wait
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The maximum length for an alias is 20 characters. Placing
an alias in quotation marks is permitted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
When a device is opened using the string interface, a device context ID
is returned.  If the application provides a return buffer in the call to
mciSendString, the ID can be used to issue commands to the device context
using the mciSendCommand interface, when necessary.
