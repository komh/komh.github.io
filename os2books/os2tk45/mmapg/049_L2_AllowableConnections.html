<H1>Allowable Connections for Connector Types</H1><!-- entering slot 57 -->
<P>
For a connection to exist between two media devices, the connectors on each
device must be of compatible types. For instance, a connection could be
established between the line OUT connector on one device and the line IN
connector on another device, however a connection between line OUT and video
IN is prohibited. This mechanism will eliminate the majority of incorrect
connections. The following table lists the allowable connections based on
connector types.  These connections are allowed in either direction. Please
note that this table should be read as meaning that a device which has a
connector of the type in the first column can connect to a device which
has a connector of the type in the second column.

<P>
The connections in the table shown above are based on connector types, not
device types. The list of connections might appear incorrect if the connector
types are misinterpreted as device types. For example, "headphones &lt;-&gt;
audio in" might be misinterpreted as meaning that headphones can be connected
to an audio input. Referring to however, we see that the HEADPHONE device
has a connector of type<I> audio in</I>.  This connector is analogous to
the plug on the headphones and, from the perspective of the headphones,
it is input.  We also see that the AMPMIX and CDAUDIO devices have connectors
of type<I> headphones</I>. The connection is correct, because headphones
can be connected to either the CD player (CDAUDIO) or to the audio adapter
(AMPMIX).
