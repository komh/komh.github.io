<P>
The Streaming Device Duet Sample (DUET1) uses mciPlayFile to play audio
help. When the application receives an HM_INFORM message, mciPlayFile is
issued as shown in the following code fragment.
<PRE>
    case HM_INFORM:
 /*
  * The user has selected the "Play Audio Help" selection in the
  * IPF help panel.
  *
  * To initiate the playing of audio help, we need to issue
  * mciPlayFile.
  *
  * Note that we assume the HM_INFORM message came from the "Play
  * Audio Help" selection since it is the only :link. with an inform
  * reftype in the .ipf file.  If there were more, we would have to
  * check the resource identifier to determine for which selection
  * this message was generated.
  */

 /*
  * Load the name of the audio help file from the resource.
  */

                (HMODULE) NULL,

                (SHORT) sizeof( achAudioHelpFile),
                achAudioHelpFile);

 ulError = mciPlayFile( (HWND)NULL,            /* Ignore owner
                                                  window            */

                                                  to play           */
