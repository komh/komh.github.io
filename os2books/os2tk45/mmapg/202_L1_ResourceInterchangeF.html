<P>
The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is the standard file format
used for storing multimedia files.  RIFF enables audio, image, animation,
and other multimedia elements to be stored in a common format.  RIFF is
also used as the basis for defining new file formats for OS/2 multimedia
software.
<P>
RIFF file I/O provides simple functions to locate, create, enter, exit,
and access the RIFF<I> chunk</I>-the basic building block of a RIFF file.
 You can open, read from, and write to RIFF files the same way as other
file types.  Blocks of data are identified by tags.  An advantage of tagged
file formats is that an application can process blocks that it understands
while ignoring blocks that do not concern it.  RIFF can also be expanded
upon (by adding new tags) without breaking existing applications.
<P>
A RIFF file created with mmioOpen can hold a single data object or, if it
is built as a compound file, multiple data objects.  Data objects in a compound
file are referred to as chunks.  Chunks in a compound file are its table
of contents, and the multiple data objects stored in the resource group.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Refer to the<I> OS/2 Multimedia Programming Reference</I> for
detailed information on how to define an application using the RIFF tagged
file structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
