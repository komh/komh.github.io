<H1>Wait and Notify Flags</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
An application can set a wait or a notify flag on a device command sent
with mciSendString or mciSendCommand. These two flags are mutually exclusive
and are available on all commands except some system commands.
<PRE>┌───────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│Flag           │Description                                  │
├───────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│wait           │The command is executed synchronously.  The  │

├───────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│notify         │The command is executed asynchronously,      │
│               │allowing control to be returned immediately  │
│               │to the application.  When the requested      │
│               │action is complete, an MM_MCINOTIFY message  │
│               │is sent to the application window procedure. │

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a command is issued without a wait flag or notify flag
specified, the command is executed asynchronously, and the application is
never notified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
The wait flag is useful for operations that are conducted quickly, like
the playback of short sounds, which the application wants to complete before
it continues.  The wait flag is also useful for operations that return information,
such as device capabilities, because the Media Device Manager parser converts
the return code to a meaningful string. However, the conversion occurs only
if the wait flag is specified.
<P>
The wait flag should be used with care when issuing commands from threads
that read application input message queues as it ties up the thread, preventing
all PM messages in the system from being processed while the command issued
with the wait flag is executed.
<P>
The notify flag is useful for operations that are conducted over a period
of time. For example, the playing of a waveform file often can take a while
to complete. By specifying the notify flag, an application requests to be
notified when processing of the command is complete.  The application window
procedure can then remain responsive to input queue processing.
