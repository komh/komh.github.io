<H1>Capturing a Still Image</H1><!-- entering slot 151 -->
<P>
There are two functions applications can use to capture an image:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MCI_GETIMAGEBUFFER<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->MCI_CAPTURE<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application uses MCI_GETIMAGEBUFFER to capture an image when it wants
to keep the image in an application buffer. The application can capture
the image from either a movie file, or the buffer of a video capture card.
This command message returns the image in the format specified by the application.

<P>
An application uses MCI_CAPTURE to capture an image from a movie file when
it wants the image kept in a digital video device element.
