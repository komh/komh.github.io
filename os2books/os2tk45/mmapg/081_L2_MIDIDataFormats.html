<P>
The MIDI support for the OS/2 multimedia system handles the RIFF RMID data
type, as well as standard MIDI file formats 0 and 1. MIDI file format 0
merges tracks of MIDI data into one track; MIDI file format 1 preserves
the separate tracks of data. MIDI file format 2 is not supported.
<P>
MIDI files are made up of chunks, similar to RIFF chunks.  In MIDI files,
there are two types of chunks:  header chunks and track chunks. A<I> header
</I>chunk provides a minimal amount of information pertaining to the entire
file. A<I> track</I> chunk contains a sequential stream of MIDI data, which
can contain information for up to 16 MIDI channels.
