<H1>Opening a File Using Buffered File I/O</H1><!-- entering slot 206 -->
<P>
When a file is opened for buffered I/O, the buffer is essentially transparent
to the application.  You can read, write, and seek in the same way as unbuffered
I/O.  To open a file using buffered file I/O, you can either provide an
I/O buffer in an application, or allow the system to allocate an internal
buffer.  To provide a user-supplied I/O buffer, you can either use mmioOpen
and have the<I> pmmioinfo</I> field point to the buffer, or use mmioSetBuffer
(see the table of buffered I/O functions in the next subsection.) To provide
a system-supplied buffer, specify the MMIO_ALLOCBUF option of the mmioOpen
function.  Unless you have a performance-sensitive application that directly
accesses an I/O buffer or opens a memory file, it is a good idea to use
the MMIO Manager to allocate the buffer.  For example, the following code
sample opens a DOS file and directs mmioOpen to allocate a standard-sized
buffer.
<PRE>hmmio = mmioOpen("EXAMPLE.DIB", NULL, MMIO_ALLOCBUF);
