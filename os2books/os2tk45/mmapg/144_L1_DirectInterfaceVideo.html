<P>
Software motion video implementation under OS/2 has attained sizable performance
advantages by enabling video decompressors to directly write to video memory.
While this technique provides good performance, it has the disadvantage
that each decompressor must deal with the pel format of the display in various
modes, clipping the output to visible regions, and any scaling that is to
be performed. Additionally, on bank-switched video displays, the decompressor
must return on partial frames to enable the video stream handler to switch
banks. The direct interface video extensions (DIVE) consolidate the complexities
of dealing with direct video frame buffer access (sometimes referred to
as "direct access" or "black hole") into a single API DLL that enables efficient
transfer to video memory with clipping, scaling, and color space conversion.
The optimized screen access functionality provided by DIVE can be used for
motion video display, fast image updates for interactive games, and fast
screen display by 3-D graphics libraries.
