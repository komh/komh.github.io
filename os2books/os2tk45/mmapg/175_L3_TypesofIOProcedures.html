<H1>Types of I/O Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
Two types of I/O procedures are as follows:
<P>
<B>Storage System IOProcs</B> unwrap data objects such as RIFF files, compound
RIFF files, or AVC files.  These IOProcs are ignorant to the content of
the data they contain.  A storage system IOProc goes directly to the OS/2
(or native) file system (memory in the case of a MEM file) and does not
pass information to any other file format or storage system IOProc.  The
internal I/O procedures provided for DOS files, memory files, and RIFF compound
files are examples of storage system IOProcs because they operate on the
storage mechanism rather than the data content itself. See the table in
the <A HREF="177_L3_InternalStorageSyste.html">Internal Storage System Procedures
</A>section.
<P>
<B>File Format IOProcs</B> manipulate multimedia data at the element level
(not to be confused with an element of a RIFF compound file).  Each IOProc
handles a different element type such as audio, image, or MIDI.  A file
format IOProc handles the element type it was written for and does not rely
on any other file format IOProcs to do any processing.  However, a file
format IOProc might need to call a storage system IOProc to obtain data
within a file containing multiple file elements.  For example, the MIDI
IOProc calls MMIO functions to access data from other storage system IOProcs
supported by MMIO. See the table in the <A HREF="178_L3_FileFormatIOProcedur.html">File
Format I/O Procedures Provided With OS/2 Multimedia</A> section.
