<P>
The maximum volume level of all logical devices in the system are controlled
by the Volume Control application supplied with OS/2 multimedia. The Volume
Control application sets a scale by which all subsequent volume commands
to the ampmix device are based. For instance, if the Volume Control sets
the master volume at 50%, then all volume levels are cut in half.
<P>
Some devices may only support two levels of volume (on/off). These devices
are off when the master volume is set to zero, and on at any other value.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> While the MCI_MASTERAUDIO message can be sent by any application,
only the master volume application or a replacement should utilize this
message to set the master volume. Master volume should only be controlled
at the discretion of an end user as implemented in the Volume Control application.
A parameter of the MCI_MASTERAUDIO message allows an application or a media
driver to query the master volume level.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
