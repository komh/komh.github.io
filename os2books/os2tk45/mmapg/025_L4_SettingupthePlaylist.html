<P>
Playlists operate on data from memory. Therefore, space must be allocated
for the memory that will be utilized with the playlist.
<P>
The SetupPlaylist procedure is performed once, during initialization of
the Clock Sample program.  It calls the procedure CopyWaveformIntoMemory
to copy the waveform files into memory buffers.  It also initializes the
playlist data structure by supplying the address and size of the memory
buffers holding the data in the appropriate data structure fields.
