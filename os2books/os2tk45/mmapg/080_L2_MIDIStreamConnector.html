<H1>MIDI Stream Connector</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->
<P>
The<I> MIDI stream</I> connector represents the flow of MIDI information
from the sequencer device to its associated amplifier-mixer (ampmix) device.
 During playback, the sequencer device sends MIDI information from either
application memory or files to the ampmix device for subsequent conversion
into audio that can be heard through conventional speakers or headphones.

<P>
Control of the characteristics of the MIDI information is provided by the
sequencer device. Volume control is provided as an additional service, although
this feature is actually provided by the ampmix device in a way that is
transparent to the calling application. If other advanced audio-shaping
features are required, the application can retrieve the device ID of the
ampmix device using the MCI_CONNECTION message. Once the device ID has been
obtained, the application can send<B> set</B> commands directly to the ampmix
device to manipulate audio attributes, such as treble, bass, balance, and
so on.
