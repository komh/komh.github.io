<P>
The OS/2 ampmix device provides the following control of audio signals.
Current values of audio attributes are retrieved using the MCI_STATUS message.
New values are set using the MCI_SET command.
<P>
Support of these features can vary by manufacturer. Some companies may develop
ampmix devices for use in OS/2 multimedia that provide additional capabilities.
To determine whether the device supports a feature, use the MCI_GETDEVCAPS
message. If the feature is not supported, MCIERR_UNSUPPORTED_FLAG is returned.

volume<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> Sets mixer-channel volume level as a percentage
of the maximum achievable effect. Volume of the left and right channels
for stereo signals can be set simultaneously using the keyword<B> all</B>,
or independently using keywords<B> left</B> and<B> right</B>. The keyword
<B>over</B> can be added to fade the volume in or out over a specified period
of time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> treble<!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> Sets treble
as a percentage of the maximum achievable effect. The effect applies to
the final output mix. Any specification of a channel is ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> bass
