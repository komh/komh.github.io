<P>
The CD audio device is a dynamic single context device and is serially shareable.

<PRE>open cdaudio alias mycd shareable wait
</PRE>

<P>
By setting the<B> shareable</B> flag, an application allows other applications
to share the device. When the device context is about to become active,
the multimedia system posts an MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message with an event of
MCI_GAINING_USE to your application.
<P>
Another common aspect of using the CD audio device is controlling the volume.
 Volume is controlled by indicating a percentage of the maximum achievable
effect.  Like all other devices in OS/2 multimedia, this volume level is
automatically tempered by the master volume level that was set using the
Volume Control application.
<P>
<B>Volume Control Using the Internal DAC</B>
<P>
By default the CD audio device utilizes the internal DAC on the CD drive
which is represented by an enabled headphones connector.  When the internal
DAC is being used to process the CD audio data, requests to set the volume
should be sent directly to the CD device.
<PRE>set mycd audio volume 50 all wait
</PRE>

<P>
Depending on the capabilities of the actual CD-ROM drive, the degree of
volume control might vary from on or off, to a reasonably linear range of
settings.  For example, the IBM PS/2 CD-ROM-II Drive supports 16 different
levels of volume.  An application might want to display either a simple
two state mute button or a volume slider or dial depending on the degree
of volume control provided by the CD drive.  If a CD audio device can set
the volume to some value other than 0 or 100, then it is likely the device
supports several volume levels.  For more information on two-state graphical
buttons, see <A HREF="157_L1_OS2MultimediaControl.html">OS/2 Multimedia
Controls</A>.  Refer to the<I> PM Programming Reference</I> for information
on linear sliders and circular sliders (dials).
<P>
<B>Volume Control Using the Ampmix Device</B>
<P>
As stated previously, some CD audio devices have the capability to stream
the audio data to a connected amplifier-mixer device.  To determine if a
particular CD audio device can stream CD audio data the device capabilities
command can be used.  If TRUE is returned, then the<I> cd stream</I> connector
can subsequently be enabled.
<PRE>capability mycd can stream wait

** <B>If this CD audio device can stream</B> **

connector mycd enable type cd stream wait
</PRE>

<P>
After enabling the cd stream, the CD audio device is utilizing the amplifier-mixer
device to convert the audio data into sound.  As such, the application must
now send all volume commands to the connected ampmix device.  Before a command
can be sent to the ampmix device, the application must obtain the device
ID of the amplifier-mixer device using the MCI_CONNECTION message.  If using
the string interface, an alias can be assigned to the connected ampmix device
as follows:
<PRE>connection mycd query type cd stream alias amp wait
</PRE>

<P>
In the previous example, the alias "amp" is assigned to the connected ampmix
device.  To set the volume or to control other audio attributes, the application
can now send messages directly to the ampmix device.
<PRE>set amp audio volume 25 over 2000 all wait
