<P>
Ultimotion compression algorithms use byte-oriented data structures and
efficient data organization to provide software-only decompression. Since
frame rate, resolution, and data rate are set when a movie is created, these
settings determine the minimum platform required for playback.  The "standard
Ultimotion movie" is defined as 320 x 240, 15 frames per second at a 150KB
per second data rate. This movie can be played on at least a 25 MHz 80386
microprocessor and an SVGA display adapter. Computers with 33 MHz 80486
microprocessors are capable of displaying 320 x 240 resolution at 24 frames
per second or 640 x 480 resolution at 15 frames per second. The frame rate
increases as the the data rate of the source device and the machine speed
increases. A frame rate of 30 frames per second is possible on a machine
with a 66 MHz 80486 microprocessor.
