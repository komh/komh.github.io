<P>
Memory playlists can be used in recording scenarios. For example, MESSAGE
instructions are useful for notifying the application of the progress of
a recording operation. A message can be sent each time the filling of a
buffer is completed.
<P>
Encasing several DATA statements inside a loop using either a LOOP or BRANCH
instruction allows the playlist to function as a simple circular buffering
scheme. The following is an example of circular buffering:
<PRE>    0:    NOP
    1:    DATA...
    2:    MESSAGE...
    3:    DATA...
    4:    MESSAGE...
    5:    DATA...
    6:    MESSAGE...
    7:    BRANCH 0
</PRE>

<P>
If the playlist processor executes an EXIT statement while recording, this
means the playlist is full. This situation is similar to a disk becoming
full during a recording operation. An ERROR_END_OF_PLAYLIST error is generated
by the playlist processor in the streaming subsystem.  As the recording
operation continues, additional data is lost.  The media driver being used
returns the MCIERR_TARGET_DEVICE_FULL to the application.
<P>
LOOP, CALL, and RETURN instructions are used for iterative playing operations.
 These instructions are not appropriate for a recording scenario because
recorded data residing in the buffer would be overwritten by each iteration.
