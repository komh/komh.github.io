<P>
A graphic button is a specialized push button that displays text, or graphics,
or both. If a graphic button is defined as a two-state graphic button, it
can have an up or down appearance. The two-state button remembers its state
and thus can be toggled from up to down and down to up. Unlike a standard
push button, the graphic button remains in the changed state after the user
has clicked on it.
<P>
Individual bitmaps can be displayed along with text while the button is
in an up, down, highlighted, or unhighlighted state. A graphic button is
highlighted when the mouse select button is held down while the pointer
is on the graphic button.
<P>
Typically, when a two-state button is up, it is selectable, and when it
is down, an action is being processed. The bitmap shown in the up state
reflects the action to be processed.
<P>
If the button has been defined as an animated graphic button, a series of
bitmaps can be displayed to produce an animated effect. If the button is
a two-state button, animation can be done for a particular button state,
or it can be independent of the change of button state. The drawing of animation
bitmaps takes precedence over the current state bitmap.
<P>
Any graphic button that draws a bitmap while the button is highlighted or
unhighlighted is not intended to be animated. Combining an animation button
style with either of these two button styles can produce unpredictable results.

<P>
Graphic button text can appear as flat on the button surface, or as three-dimensional,
with its z-order raised or recessed, relative to the button surface.
<P>
These functional capabilities make graphic buttons ideal to use when designing
a multimedia device control panel.
