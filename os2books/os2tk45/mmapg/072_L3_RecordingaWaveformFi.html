<H1>Recording a Waveform File</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
One of the typical uses of the waveform audio device is to digitize an input
signal or sound into discrete samples for storage in a file.  An example
of this would be recording an electronic audio mail message to actually
<I>tell</I> someone about an idea, as opposed to typing a memo on the same
subject.  An electronic audio mail application would be completely shielded
from the complexity of digitizing a signal and would only need to specify
a file, while providing the user with a simple control panel to allow the
message to be recorded.  The user might press a stop button on the control
panel when finished describing the idea.  The application could then issue
a<B> stop</B> command to the waveaudio device to discontinue the recording.

<PRE>open myidea.wav waveaudio alias wave wait
record wave notify
.
.
.
** <B>recording the idea into myidea.wav</B> **
.
.
.
stop wave wait
</PRE>

<P>
Like many text editors, the waveform audio media driver will not actually
modify the original file until it receives a command to save the changes.
 Any temporary files created during the record operation will be located
in the directory specified by the MSV_WORKPATH multimedia system variable.
 The path can be specified on the<I> system</I> page of the Multimedia Setup
application. The use of temporary files is completely transparent to the
application.
<P>
The file can be saved using the original file name, or a new file name can
be specified. If a<B> save</B> command is not issued before closing the
waveform audio device, all changes will be discarded.
<PRE>save wave wait
close wave wait
</PRE>

<P>
It is possible to open or load the waveaudio device specifying a special
<I>readonly</I> option.  In this mode, the waveaudio device prevents any
modification to the file from either the<B> save</B> or<B> record</B> commands.
In certain circumstances, the driver might be able to optimize performance
by utilizing the information that the file will not be modified. The option
will also allow multiple applications to share the same file for playback
purposes and will prevent inadvertent modification of the file.
