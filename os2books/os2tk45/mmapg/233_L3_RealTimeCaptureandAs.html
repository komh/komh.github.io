<H1>Real-Time Capture and Asymmetric Capture</H1><!-- entering slot 249 -->
<P>
Typically, a stream is established to read a series of moving images from
the device.  This continuous capture mode is called symmetric or<I> real-time
</I>capture, and is performed at a constant frame rate and constant frame
size.  When established, a stream captures images continuously without assistance
from the application code.  However, video images can be captured one frame
at a time when directed by the application.  This type of capture mode is
referred to as<I> asymmetric</I> capture because the time between successive
frames is not constant.  The frame rate is determined by how long the application
delays between taking image snapshots.  Asymmetric capture is performed
with IOCtls only; the OS/2 multimedia streaming mechanism is not used.
