<H1>Creating MIDI Memory Files</H1><!-- entering slot 100 -->
<P>
Applications that access memory buffers to store and access MIDI data can
use the memory I/O features of the multimedia input/output (MMIO) file services.
 This technique consists of opening a memory file using mmioOpen.  mmioOpen
has a pointer to the buffer of MIDI data as a parameter.  This buffer can
then be operated on by MCI and MMIO as if it were a file.
<P>
The details of opening the file and setting up the MIDI buffer varies depending
on an application's requirements. For example, the memory buffer can be
allocated by the MMIO system and filled subsequently by the application,
or the memory buffer can be allocated by the application and passed to MMIO.
 The buffer can be filled in different ways such as mmioRead, mmioWrite,
and mmioAdvance.
<P>
Care must be taken when calling MMIO functions and sending MCI messages
to the same memory file.  MMIO and MCI are independent subsystems linked
only through the MMIO memory handle passed to MCI_OPEN.  There is for example,
no relationship between MCI_SEEK and mmioSeek.  Each subsystem keeps its
own set of relevant files and stream pointers.  If one subsystem changes
the data in memory, but the memory had previously been cued with MCI_CUE,
the change of data will not be recognized by MCI until a call to reload
the streams has been issued.
<P>
The following code fragment shows the opening of a memory file with a user-supplied
MIDI buffer of untranslated (format 0 or 1) data and the playing of that
data through MCI.
