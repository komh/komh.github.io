<H1>Direct Audio RouTines (DART) Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 64 -->
<P>
OS/2 multimedia provides application developers with a number of choices
for playing and recording audio files. They can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open the waveaudio device<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open a memory playlist and use operation codes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the direct audio interface of the ampmix device
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The waveaudio device provides an easy-to-use interface that works well for
applications with simple audio requirements. However time-critical game
applications usually demand a faster response time than the waveaudio device
can achieve, because of the device-independent layers of software between
it and the audio device.
<P>
The memory playlist method of audio playback and recording reduces some
of the system overhead that the waveaudio device incurs, because the playlist
can stream audio data directly from application memory buffers to audio
device buffers. But the playlist is not the ideal solution when precise
buffer flow control is needed.
<P>
The Direct Audio RouTines (DART) interface for the ampmix device enables
games and multimedia applications to bypass the waveaudio device entirely
and communicate directly with the amp mixer. Using this interface, applications
get the high-speed audio response they require, while remaining compatible
with existing OS/2 multimedia applications. Because DART uses the media
control interface (MCI), applications using DART can share the audio device
with other applications simply by processing the MM_MCIPASSDEVICE message.

DART offers the following advantages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
