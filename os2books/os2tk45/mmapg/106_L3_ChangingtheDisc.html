<P>
If the user ejects a disc while the CD-XA device is playing, the device
is stopped. When the CD-XA device detects that the disc has been changed
and a file was opened on the previous disc, it closes the current CD-XA
file and resets to the default state of the device.  This state is identical
to opening the CD-XA device without specifying a file. Following the reset,
the CD-XA device returns MCIERR_MEDIA_CHANGED on the first command following
detection of the disc change.
<P>
To avoid the interruption of play by the ejection of the disc, the application
can disable a manual eject with an MCI_SET command before beginning playback.
