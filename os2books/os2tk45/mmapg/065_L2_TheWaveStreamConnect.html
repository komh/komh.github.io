<H1>The Wave Stream Connector</H1><!-- entering slot 73 -->
<P>
The<I> wave stream</I> connector represents the flow of digital information
to and from the waveaudio device to its associated amplifier-mixer (ampmix)
device.  During playback, the waveaudio device sends digitized sounds from
either application memory or files to the ampmix device for subsequent conversion
into audio that can be heard through conventional speakers or headphones.
When recording, the waveaudio device receives waveforms from the ampmix
device and stores the digital information in a file or in application memory.

<P>
Control of the characteristics of the waveform information is provided by
the waveaudio device.  The quality of the waveform can be controlled by
setting the format, sampling rate, bits per sample, and the number of channels.
 As an additional service, the waveaudio device will also allow the volume
to be controlled.  This service is actually provided by the ampmix device
in a way that is transparent to the calling application. If other advanced
audio shaping features are required, the application can retrieve the device
ID of the ampmix device using the MCI_CONNECTION message.  Once the device
ID has been obtained, the application can send commands directly to the
ampmix device.  Examples include<B> set</B> commands to manipulate treble,
bass, and balance.
