<H1>DIVE Image Buffers</H1><!-- entering slot 159 -->
<P>
Because DIVE will use off-screen VRAM where available for acceleration of
blitting operations, the application should allocate all source blitting
buffers from DIVE whenever possible.  To allocate a buffer, the application
would make the following call:
<PRE>ULONG   ulBufNum;
FOURCC  fccColorSpace;
ULONG   ulWidth, ulHeight, ulLineSizeBytes;
PBYTE   pbImageBuffer;

ulErrorCode = DiveAllocImageBuffer(
        hDive,          /* DIVE handle  */
        &amp;ulBufNum,     /* Buffer number (output)       */
        fccColorSpace,  /* Color format */
        ulWidth, ulHeight,     /* Size of maximum image        */
        ulLineSizeBytes,
        &amp;pbImageBuffer);
</PRE>

<P>
A corresponding DiveFreeImageBuffer function call is used to deallocate
the buffer when it is no longer needed.  The color format of the image buffer
is described by<I> fccColorSpace</I>. The DIVE interface defines constants
for a variety of 8-, 16-, and 24-bit color encoding schemes.  After a buffer
is allocated and before it can be used for blitting, it must be accessed
as shown in the following example:
<PRE>PBYTE   pbImageBuffer;
ULONG   ulBufferScanLineBytes, ulBufferScanLines;

ulErrorCode = DiveBeginImageBufferAccess(
        hDiveInst,          /* DIVE handle   */
        ulBufferNumber,       /* Buffer number */
        &amp;pbImageBuffer,    /* Ptr to image buffer (output) */
        &amp;ulBufferScanLineBytes);  /* Scan line length (output)    */
        &amp;ulBufferScanLines);  /* Scan lines (output)    */

</PRE>

<P>
DIVE calculates the number of bytes per scan line for the image buffer (based
on the color format) and returns the value in<I> ulBufferScanLineBytes</I>.
 The application can now write color data into<I> pbImageBuffer</I>.  For
example, the application could open a bit-map file and read the bit-map
data directly into the image buffer.  After the data has been written, the
application calls DiveEndImageBufferAccess to deaccess the buffer. Be sure
to use scan line bytes (you might have to read a line at a time).
