<P>
In addition to playing motion video with the digital video device, you can
also play FLC and FLI animation files. FLC and FLI are the standard file
formats for most animation tools. The FLI file format is most common. FLI
is limited to a 320 x 200 display resolution and a custom 256-color palette.
The FLC file format is an extension to FLI and allows a 640 x 480 resolution.

<PRE>open cartoon.flc type digitalvideo alias animate
play animate notify
close animate
</PRE>

<P>
The FLC/FLI video files do not contain any audio data. However, the digital
video device will search for an audio file (.WAV) with the same base name
as the animation file in the same directory. If such a file exists, the
audio is played with the animation file In the previous example, if a file
named CARTOON.WAV exists, the audio file plays with the animation file and
continues to play until CARTOON.FLC ends.
<P>
Seeking within a FLC/FLI file is not supported because these files contain
only one initial I-frame. All other frames in the file are delta frames.
All seek requests result in a seek to the beginning of the file.
