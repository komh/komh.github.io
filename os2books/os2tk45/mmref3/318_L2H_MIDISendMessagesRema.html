<P>
MIDISendMessages is used to send regular (non-SysEx) MIDI messages only.

<P>
The RTMIDI timer<I> must</I> be started before calling this function. Call
<A HREF="329_L2_MIDITimer.html">MIDITimer</A> to start the RTMIDI timer.

<P>
The instance number of the application node from which you want to send
messages should be set in the<I> ulSourceInstance</I> field of the <A HREF="1570_L2_MESSAGE.html">MESSAGE
</A>structures. Since each compound message has its own source instance
number, it is possible to mix and match source application nodes within
the array of compound messages.
<P>
Messages with time stamps indicating the current time or prior will be sent
immediately. Messages with time stamps indicating a future time will be
placed in a queue.
<P>
The time stamp value is absolute. The RTMIDI timer should be used as the
basis for the time stamp value. For example, to indicate that a compound
message should be processed 10 milliseconds in the future, the value placed
in the<I> ulTime</I> field of the <A HREF="1570_L2_MESSAGE.html">MESSAGE
</A>structure should be equal to the RTMIDI timer value plus 10.
<P>
The application's thread is blocked until all messages are either sent or
queued.
<P>
If the outbound message queue cannot hold all future messages, the application's
thread will be blocked for an indeterminate length of time. While this thread
is blocked, the buffer holding the array of messages should not be modified
by another thread.
