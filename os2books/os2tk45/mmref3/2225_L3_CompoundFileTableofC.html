<H1>Compound File Table of Contents (CTOC) Chunk</H1><!-- entering slot 2228 -->
<P>
The CTOC chunk functions mainly as an index, allowing direct access to elements
within a compound file.  The CTOC chunk also contains information about
the attributes of the entire file and of each media element within the file.

<P>
To provide the maximum flexibility for defining compound file formats, the
CTOC chunk can be customized at several levels.  The CTOC chunk contains
fields whose length and usage is defined by other CTOC fields. This parameterization
adds complexity, but it provides flexibility to file format designers and
allows applications to correctly read data without necessarily knowing the
specific file format definition.
