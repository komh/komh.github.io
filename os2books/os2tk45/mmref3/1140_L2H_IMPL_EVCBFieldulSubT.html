<UL>
<P>
<B>ulSubType</B> (<A HREF="2162_L2_ULONG.html">ULONG</A>)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Identifies
the event subtype.  This field is used to further subdivide an event type.
(See the stream handler module section for more details.) Following is a
list of system-defined implicit events:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
EVENT_EOS<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> End of stream event.  This event is generated
after the target stream handler has consumed the last buffer in the stream.
 This event notifies the application media control device that the stream
has completed.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> EVENT_ERROR<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> An
error has occurred in a stream handler or device driver while streaming.
The<I> ulStatus</I> field contains the error return code.  Some stream handlers
also set some flags in the<I> ulFlags</I> field to further describe the
severity of the error.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> EVENT_PLAYLISTCUEPOINT<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> A
memory stream handler playlist cue-point event, used when streaming data
to or from the memory stream handler. See the playlist-specific event control
block (<A HREF="1997_L2_PLAYL_EVCB.html">PLAYL_EVCB</A>) for the EVCB field
definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> EVENT_PLAYLISTMESSAGE<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> A
memory stream handler playlist message, used when streaming data to or from
the memory stream handler. See the playlist-specific event control block
(<A HREF="1997_L2_PLAYL_EVCB.html">PLAYL_EVCB</A>) for the EVCB field definitions.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>EVENT_QUEUE_OVERFLOW<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Event
queue overflow. Indicates that an event has been lost due to too many events
being generated. The application media control device must use this event
to clear any waiting conditions. See<I> Performance-Tuning the Stream Manager
</I>in the<I> OS/2 Multimedia Subsystem Programming Guide</I> for more information
on increasing the event queue size.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>Asynchronous notification of the completion of
an <A HREF="558_L2_SpiStopStream.html">SpiStopStream</A> call.  Both the
flush stop and discard stop are asynchronous, while the pause stop is synchronous.
See the <A HREF="558_L2_SpiStopStream.html">SpiStopStream</A> function.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>EVENT_SYNC_PREROLLED<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Asynchronous
notification of the completion of an <A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream
</A>call.  The preroll start is asynchronous, while the start stream is
synchronous. All synchronized streams are prerolled. See the <A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream
</A>function.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
