<P>
Resources for the stream are allocated at this time.  Split streams share
one set of stream buffers. This type of stream is used for interleaved data
types. Once a stream is created of an interleaved data type (specified in
the SPCB), another stream can use the stream handle of the first stream
in the<I> hstreamBuf</I> parameter to indicate that it needs to share the
set of buffers of the first stream. Each stream created must have a unique
implicit event control block (EVCB). For NULL streams, both the<I> hidSrc
</I>and the<I> hidTgt</I> must be the NULL stream handler ID (HID). Source
and target devices can be specified using the DCBs for the respective stream
handlers.  Each stream handler can define a set of device control blocks
that can be used at stream-creation time.
