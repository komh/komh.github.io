<P>
This message is used by a stream handler to give a full buffer to the physical
device driver.  An example would be the case of audio playback, where the
stream handler passes a buffer with data to the physical device driver.

<P>
The<I> pBuffer</I> parameter is a pointer to the data buffer.  Note that
this pointer is either a physical 0:32 pointer, 16:16 far pointer, or a
global linear pointer.  The pointer type is defined when the stream registers
a stream with the device driver (<A HREF="644_L2_DDCMD_REG_STREAM.html">DDCMD_REG_STREAM</A>).

<P>
Many devices cannot handle a 0 length buffer. If the driver receives a 0
length buffer, it should not reject the buffer. The driver should do nothing
with the buffer and return it in the same order in which it was sent.
