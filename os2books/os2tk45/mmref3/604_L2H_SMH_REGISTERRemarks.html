<P>
Once a DLL stream handler is installed in the system, the stream handler
must call the Sync/Stream Manager to register its entry point.  After this,
the Sync/Stream Manager knows the entry point address for the stream handler,
specifically the SHC entry point. Therefore, the stream handler must pass
the entry point address to the Sync/Stream Manager on the register call.
 In addition, when SMH_REGISTER is issued, the stream handler informs the
Sync/Stream Manager whether it can be a source or target stream handler.
 The Sync/Stream Manager, in turn, returns the stream handler IDs for future
interaction with the Sync/Stream Manager.  The stream handler uses this
ID to identify itself whenever calling the Sync/Stream Manager so it will
know which stream handler is actually calling it. If a NULL stream handler
is being registered, both the source and the target <A HREF="1128_L2_HID.html">HID
</A>are returned as the same <A HREF="1128_L2_HID.html">HID</A>.  Also,
the REGISTER_NONSTREAMING bit flag must be set for NULL stream handlers.
 The stream-handler name can be a maximum of 8 characters in length to allow
device-driver stream handlers to use their device names as the stream-handler
name.
