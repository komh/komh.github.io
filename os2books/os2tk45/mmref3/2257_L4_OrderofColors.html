<H1>Order of Colors</H1><!-- entering slot 2260 -->
<P>
The colors in the table should appear in order of importance. This can help
a device driver render a bitmap on a device that cannot display as many
colors as there are in the bitmap. If the DIB is in Windows 3.0 format,
the driver can use the<I> biClrImportant</I> field of the BITMAPINFOHEADER
structure to determine which colors are important.
