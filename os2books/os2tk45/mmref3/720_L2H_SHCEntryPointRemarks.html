<P>
DLL stream handlers must supply an interface to communicate with the Sync/Stream
Manager.  This interface, called the stream handler command (SHC) interface,
exports stream handler commands (SHCs) for use by the Sync/Stream Manager
to set up and control data streams.  These SHCs are accessible through a
single entry point, SHCEntryPoint.
<P>
In addition, device driver stream handlers receive commands from the Sync/Stream
Manager to initialize and perform streaming functions.  These stream handler
commands (SHCs) are also accessible through SHCEntryPoint.  The main routine
is an IDC interface with the Sync/Stream Manager Device Driver.  The SSM
calls the device driver stream handler by issuing stream programming interface
(SPI) functions such as <A HREF="367_L2_SpiCreateStream.html">SpiCreateStream</A>,
<A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream</A>, and <A HREF="558_L2_SpiStopStream.html">SpiStopStream</A>.
