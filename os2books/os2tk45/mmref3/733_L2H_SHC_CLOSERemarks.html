<P>
A call to terminate the use of the stream handler by the Sync/Stream Manager
is made when all processes using the SPI functions have terminated. Only
device driver stream handlers are called with SHC_CLOSE to clean up any
resources still allocated, including any stream protocols (SPCBs) that are
installed in the stream handler.  DLL stream handlers are notified of termination
through a DLL termination routine.
