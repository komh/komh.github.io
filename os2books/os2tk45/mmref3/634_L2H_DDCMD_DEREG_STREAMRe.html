<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This message removes the communication link between
the physical device driver and the stream handler for a particular stream
instance. The only input is the stream handle, which indicates to the device
driver which stream to destroy.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After a deregister, the VSD (or device driver) no
longer has access to any buffers, and the buffers will be returned to SSM
by the stream handler. The VSD does not have to return the buffers; they
are returned for the it. The VSD should not return from the destroy until
it has stopped using all buffers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
