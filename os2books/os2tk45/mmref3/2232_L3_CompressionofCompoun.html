<H1>Compression of Compound File Elements</H1><!-- entering slot 2235 -->
<P>
Compound file elements can be compressed.  The<I> ulCompressTech</I> field
of a CTOC table entry contains a FOURCC compression technique identifier
for the corresponding compound file element.  If the field is zero, the
compound file element is not compressed.
<P>
The definition of a specific compression technique may specify that either
the entire compound file element is compressed, or that some specific subset,
for example one or more RIFF chunks, is compressed.
<P>
The<I> ulUncompressSize</I> field contains the number of bytes that the
compound file element will occupy in memory after decompression. If the
compound file element is not compressed, this field contain the same value
as the<I> ulSize</I> field, which identifies the file size of the compound
file element.
<P>
Compression techniques may demand extra header fields or extra entry fields
for decompression parameters.  Compression technique identifiers, and any
new entry fields corresponding to decompression technique parameters, must
be unique.  See <A HREF="2199_L2_RegisteringMultimedi.html">Registering
Multimedia Formats</A> for registration information.
