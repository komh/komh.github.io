<H1>The LIST 'movi' Chunk</H1><!-- entering slot 2244 -->
<P>
Following the header information is a LIST 'movi' chunk that contains chunks
of the actual data in the streams; that is, the pictures and sounds themselves.
The data chunks are grouped into 'rec' chunks.
<P>
Like any RIFF chunk, the data chunks contain a four-character code to identify
the chunk type. The four-character code that identifies each chunk consists
of the stream number and a two-character code that defines the type of information
encapsulated in the chunk. For example, a waveform chunk is identified by
a of 'wb' two-character code. If a waveform chunk corresponded to the second
LIST 'hdrl' stream description, it would have a '01wb' four-character code.

<P>
Since all the format information is in the header, the audio data contained
in these data chunks does not contain any information about its format.
An audio data chunk has the following format (the ## in the format represents
the stream identifier):
<PRE>WAVE Bytes   '##wb'
     BYTE    abBytes[];
</PRE>

<P>
Video data can be compressed or uncompressed DIBs. An uncompressed DIB has
BI_RGB specified for the<I> biCompression</I> field in its associated BITMAPINFO
structure. A compressed DIB has a value other than BI_RGB specified in the
<I>biCompression</I> field.
<P>
A data chunk for an uncompressed DIB contains RGB video data. These chunks
are identified with a two-character code of "db" (db is an abbreviation
for DIB bits). Data chunks for a compressed DIB are identified with a two-character
code of 'dc' (dc is an abbreviation for DIB compressed). Neither data chunk
will contain any header information about the DIBs. The data chunk for an
uncompressed DIB has the following form:
<PRE>DIB Bits   '##db'
    BYTE   abBits[];
</PRE>

<P>
The data chunk for a compressed DIB has the following form:
<PRE>Compressed DIB   '##dc'
    BYTE         abBits[];
</PRE>
