<UL>
<P>
<B>ulCmd</B> (<A HREF="2162_L2_ULONG.html">ULONG</A>)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Defines
the following flags:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
DDCMD_START<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Starts a device.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_STOP
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Stops a device and returns the current stream time
in milliseconds.  All buffers in the PDD are flushed and everything is reset
to 0.  The device driver sends the current stream time back to the stream
handler in milliseconds (using the<I> pParm</I> and<I> ulParmSize</I> fields).
 For example, return a ULONG of stream time (in milliseconds) and the ULONG
of 4 bytes is input in the<I> ulParmSize</I> field.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_PAUSE
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Pauses the device and returns the current stream
time in milliseconds.  Unlike DDCMD_STOP, DDCMD_PAUSE is not destructive.
 The device driver is able to resume its function at a later time, exactly
where it was paused.  DDCMD_ PAUSE returns the current stream time in milliseconds
within the<I> pParm</I> field.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_RESUME<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Resumes
a currently paused stream.  DDCMD_RESUME is only honored if the stream was
paused previously.  If the stream was stopped and the stream handler issues
DDCMD_RESUME, an ERROR_INVALID_SEQUENCE is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_ENABLE_EVENT
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Enables event detection if your PDD supports events.
 The event message is sent to the device driver and reviews the structure.
 The<I> hEvent</I> field is a unique handle that signifies the event.<I> pParm
</I>contains the stream time with which the event should be detected.  This
command would be honored whether currently in a streaming state, pause,
or stop.
<P>
For example, a stream handler is programmed to be detected at 1000 milliseconds
in the stream.  It sends a DDCMD_ENABLE_EVENT to the device driver with
a unique handle event (<I>hEvent</I>) and 1000 milliseconds stated in the
<I>pParm</I> field.  The device driver obtains the handle event, makes sure
there are no duplicate entries, and adds the<I> hEvent</I> to a link list
or array (depending on how the device driver is implemented).  The device
driver now knows it must report an event back to the stream handler when
1000 milliseconds has been reached in the stream.  See <A HREF="700_L2_SHD_REPORT_EVENT.html">SHD_REPORT_EVENT
</A>for further information.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_DISABLE_EVENT
<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL>Disables event detection in the device driver.
 An event handle is passed from the structure.  The device driver searches
its linked list or array to find the matching event handle and deletes it
from the list.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_PAUSE_TIME<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Pauses
the time but not the stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> DDCMD_RESUME_TIME<!-- lm: 0x11 12 -->
<UL> Resumes
the time.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
