<P>
A stream handler can use this message to report events, namely, cue points,
stream errors, implicit and explicit events, and sync pulses to the Sync/Stream
Manager.  Stream handlers can detect the following events and report them
to the Sync/Stream Manager to be passed back to the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

directly:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
Each stream handler might or might not be able to generate and receive synchronization
pulses.  This capability for each stream handler is defined in the SPCBs
for that stream handler.
<P>
Synchronization pulses are passed as an event from the master stream handler.
Synchronization pulses are distributed by the Sync/Stream Manager based
on the synchronization relationship of the programmed stream.  This distribution
is effective for both DLL and device driver slave stream handlers. Device
driver stream handlers receive sync pulses by way of their sync pulse SYNC_EVCB.
 Each slave stream handler must regularly update the sync pulse SYNC_EVCB
with its calculated stream time.  The Sync/Stream Manager checks this slave-handler
stream time against the master stream time and decides whether to send a
sync pulse to this handler.
<P>
The device driver stream handler checks for sync pulses from the Sync/Stream
Manager by polling a flag in the sync-pulse SYNC_EVCB.  The Sync/Stream
Manager sets the flag to indicate a sync pulse and updates the current master
stream time. Typically, the device driver slave stream handler polls the
flag once during interrupt processing and adjusts stream usage accordingly.

<P>
DLL stream handlers receive sync pulses in one of two ways: either by registering
a semaphore with the Sync/Stream Manager, or by the same method as the Sync/Stream
Manager uses for device driver stream handler.
