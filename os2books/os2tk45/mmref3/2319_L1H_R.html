<B>raster graphics</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Computer graphics in which
a display image is composed of an array of pels arranged in rows and columns.

</UL><B> ray-tracing</B>
-<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> A technique used by 3-D rendering software programs
that automatically figures an object's position in three dimensions and
calculates shadows, reflections, and hidden surfaces based on user-entered
light locations and material characteristics.  (In other words, if the user
orders an object to be a mirror, the computer produces the mirror with all
its correct reflective properties.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> real time
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> (1) Pertaining to the processing of data by
a computer in connection with another process outside the computer according
to time requirements imposed by the outside process.  This term is also
used to describe systems operating in conversational mode and processes
that can be influenced by human intervention while they are in progress.
(2) A process control system or a computer-assisted instruction program,
in which response to input is fast enough to affect subsequent output.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> real-time
recording</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Refers to the capturing of video
and audio data in real time, as the analog signals are generated from the
video source device. The video source device can be a camcorder, or a videotape
or videodisc player.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> record</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> To
transfer data from one source (for example, microphone, CD, videodisc) or
set of sources to another medium.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

</UL><B> reference
frame</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> (1) Refers to the complete frame that
is created at periodic intervals in the output stream.  An editing operation
always begins at a reference frame. (2) Synonymous with<I> key frame</I> and

<UL> In videotaping, to create a realistic image
from objects and light data in a scene.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> repeat
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> A mode which causes the medium to go to the
beginning and start replaying when it reaches the medium's end.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> resolution
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> (1) In computer graphics, a measure of the
sharpness of an image, expressed as the number of lines and columns on the
display screen or the number of pels per unit of area. (2) The number of
lines in an image that an imaging system (for example, a telescope, the
human eye, a camera, and so on) can resolve. A higher resolution makes text
and graphics appear clearer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> resource</B>  -
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<UL>  Recovery
processing performed by sync-point services when the failure of a session,
