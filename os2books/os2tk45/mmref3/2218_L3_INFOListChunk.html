<H1>INFO List Chunk</H1><!-- entering slot 2220 -->
<P>
The 'INFO' list is a registered global form type that can store information
that helps identify the contents of the chunk. This information is useful
but does not affect the way a program interprets the file; examples are
copyright information and comments. An 'INFO' list is a 'LIST' chunk with
list type 'INFO'. The following shows a sample 'INFO' list chunk:
<PRE>LIST('INFO'     INAM("Two Trees"Z)
                ICMT("A picture for the opening screen"Z) )
</PRE>

<P>
An 'INFO' list should contain only the following chunks. New chunks may
be defined, but an application should ignore any chunk it doesn't understand.
The chunks listed below may only appear in an 'INFO' list. Each chunk contains
a ZSTR, or null-terminated text string.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
