<P>
The visible rectangles are passed using the<I> pVisDstRects</I> parameter
of <A HREF="2046_L2_SETUP_BLITTER.html">SETUP_BLITTER</A>. These rectangles
are relative to the destination window origin. The display engine will determine
if it is fully visible if<I> ulNumDstRects</I> = 1 and the first *<I>pVisDstRects
</I>= {0, 0, width, height}. The display engine will also assume the image
is fully clipped if<I> ulNumDstRects</I> = = 0  or if<I> ulNumDstRects</I> =
= 1 and  the rectangle width or height are zero.
<P>
If DiveSetupBlitter determines that the requested blitter operations to
follow can be performed  partially or wholly using display hardware features,
it will do so.  If the requested input format is supported by the software
emulation within the display engine but not by the display hardware, DiveSetupBlitter
will enable conversion to a format that is supported by the hardware to
an internally allocated buffer. The converted image will, in turn, be transferred
from the internal buffer to the screen by the hardware.
<P>
When PM sends a WM_VRNDISABLED message, the application must inform DIVE
that the visible regions are about to enter a changing state.  This is done
with a call to DiveSetupBlitter ( hDive, 0 ). When the state of visible
regions again becomes static, PM sends a WM_VRNENABLED message and a normal
call to DiveSetupBlitter is used.
<P>
DiveSetupBlitter was not intended to be called at high frequency. If several
different source/destination size pairs are to be used, try opening several
instances to increase performance.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<I> fNonScreenInstance</I> parameter specified on <A HREF="142_L2_DiveOpen.html">DiveOpen
</A>indicates whether or not DiveSetupBlitter should use acceleration hardware
when present.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
