<H1>Registered Form and Chunk Types</H1><!-- entering slot 2206 -->
<P>
By convention, the form-type code for registered form types contains only
digits and uppercase letters.  Form-type codes that are all uppercase denote
a registered, unique form type.  Use lowercase letters for temporary or
prototype chunk types.
<P>
Certain chunk types are also globally unique and must also be registered
before use.  These registered chunk types are not specific to a certain
form type; they can be used in any form.  If a registered chunk type can
be used to store your data, you should use the registered chunk type rather
than define your own chunk type containing the same type of information.

<P>
For example, a chunk with chunk ID 'INAM' always contains the name or title
of a file.  Also, within all RIFF files, file names or titles are contained
within chunks with ID 'INAM' and have a standard data format.
