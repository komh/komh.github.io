<H1>DiveAllocImageBuffer - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 70 -->
<P>
This function will allocate a buffer to contain an image.  The buffer may
be allocated in either system memory or in VRAM, depending on a number of
factors.  The entire image buffer will be allocated in video memory if all
of the following conditions are met:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Display hardware that accelerates certain operations
is installed, and that hardware requires the source image data to reside
in video memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The source image data is in a format that the hardware
accepts as an input for accelerating certain operations.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Sufficient VRAM is available to hold the image.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If any of these conditions are not met, the buffer will be allocated in
system memory.
<P>
If<I> pbImageBuffer</I> is 0, DIVE will allocate a buffer for the specified
size and FOURCC. If<I> pbImageBuffer</I> is a pointer to a non-DIVE-allocated
buffer, DIVE will associate a buffer number to that pointer.
<P>
Even though no memory is allocated by DiveAllocImageBuffer when user-allocated
buffers are associated, <A HREF="135_L2_DiveFreeImageBuffer.html">DiveFreeImageBuffer
</A>should be called to release the buffer association to avoid using up
available buffer indexes. The specified line size will be used if a buffer
is allocated in system memory, or if a user buffer is associated. If the
specified line size is zero, the allocated line size is rounded up to the
nearest ULONG boundary.
<P>
Because only one blitter setup is supported at any time for an instance,
if multiple source buffers are allocated in an instance, they must be of
the same size and color space to work with <A HREF="083_L2_DiveBlitImage.html">DiveBlitImage</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If hardware acceleration is present and the<I> fccColorSpace
</I>format is supported as input to the hardware, the allocation will be
performed with a devescape_imgbufalloc call to the display driver.  If the
format is not supported by hardware or if hardware acceleration is not available,
the buffer will be allocated in system memory using DosAllocMem.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
