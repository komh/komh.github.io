<P>
Once a stream is created, a data object can be associated with the stream.
 This data object is what will be streamed to an output device or from an
input device.  Devices must be specified by using device control blocks
(DCBs) in the <A HREF="367_L2_SpiCreateStream.html">SpiCreateStream</A> call.
 Each stream handler can define a set of associate control blocks that it
can understand.  The<I> hid</I> indicates which stream handler will process
this association.  This function is valid only on a newly created (not started)
stream, a stopped stream (discard or flush stop), or after the end-of-stream
notification.  This function is not valid after a pause. This function returns
an error if the stream has been prerolled, but not started or discard stopped.
 The stream time is not reset to 0 after a new object is associated.  Use
<A HREF="522_L2_SpiSeekStream.html">SpiSeekStream</A> to seek to the beginning
of the data object.  Stream time is no longer valid after an SpiAssociate
call.  An <A HREF="522_L2_SpiSeekStream.html">SpiSeekStream</A> call must
be made by the application media control device to set the correct stream
time or to seek the device.
