<P>
This message indicates to the physical device driver that a specific stream
instance will become the active stream instance.  The<I> pSetupParm</I> field
is used for device-specific information.  Typically, it is used to pass
the current stream time from the stream handler to the PDD because a seek
might have been requested on the stream prior to the stream start; thus,
the PDD should adjust its time to this new reference time.  Time is passed
as a pointer to the time in milliseconds.
