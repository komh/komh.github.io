<P>
This section describes data types in C language. A data type name beginning
with "P" (for example, PMCI_CONNECTOR_PARMS) is likely to be a pointer to
another data type (in this instance, MCI_CONNECTOR_PARMS). If no data type
definition can be found in this section for a data type name "Pxxxxxx,"
it becomes a pointer to the data type "xxxxxx," for which a definition should
be found in this section. The implicit type definition needed for such a
pointer "Pxxxxxx" is:
<PRE>typedef xxxxxx *Pxxxxxx;
</PRE>

<P>
Such definitions are provided by means of the system header files.
