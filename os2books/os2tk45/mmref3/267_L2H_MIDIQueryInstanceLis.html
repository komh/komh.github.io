<P>
The application should call <A HREF="286_L2_MIDIQueryNumInstance.html">MIDIQueryNumInstances
</A>to retrieve the number of instances and initialize<I> ulNumInstances
</I>with this value.
<P>
The instance names of hardware nodes are defined by device drivers.
<P>
The application should provide a user-driven method to refresh the list
of instances. The selection of instances can change at any time. Generally,
an application would only call MIDIQueryInstanceList to obtain the list
of hardware nodes; instances of other classes are usually not of interest.
Therefore, this function should be called every time the application wants
to present a list of available hardware nodes to the user. This ensures
that the list is always up to date.
