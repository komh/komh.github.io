<P>
After this function is issued for a stream, the stream handle for that stream
can no longer be used. All resources for that stream are returned to the
system. Removing the master stream of a sync group disables the sync group.
Removing a slave stream of a sync group removes only the slave stream from
the group, and does not affect the other streams in the group. Split streams
require that the stream that owns the buffers be destroyed last.
