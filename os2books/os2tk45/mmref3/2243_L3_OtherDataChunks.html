<P>
If you need to align data in you AVI file you can add a 'JUNK' chunk. (This
chunk is a standard RIFF type.) Applications reading these chunks will ignore
their contents. Files played from CD-ROM can use these chunks to align data
so they can be read more efficiently. You might want to use this chunk to
align your data for the 2 kilobyte CD-ROM boundaries. The 'JUNK' chunk has
the following form:
<PRE>    AVI Padding     'JUNK'
        Byte        data[]
</PRE>

<P>
As with any other RIFF files, all applications that read AVI files should
ignore the non-AVI chunks that it does not recognize. Applications that
read and write AVI files should preserve the non-AVI chunk when they save
files they have loaded.
