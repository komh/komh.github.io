<P>
Instances are enabled separately for send and receive. For example, an application
can choose to enable an instance for send only. A reference count is kept
of how many times an instance is enabled for send, and a similar count is
kept for receive.
<P>
If the request is for both send and receive, and the instance only supports
one direction, then either MIDIERR_SENDONLY or MIDIERR_RECEIVEONLY is returned
(as appropriate), and the instance is not enabled for either direction.
If the instance supports neither send nor receive, MIDIERR_NOT_ALLOWED will
be returned. Therefore, the application should call <A HREF="260_L2_MIDIQueryInstanceLis.html">MIDIQueryInstanceList
</A>to determine the capabilities of the instance before attempting to enable
it.
<P>
MIDIEnableInstance has special meaning for hardware nodes. Hardware nodes
are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled. When a hardware
node is enabled for the first time, the Type A driver that it represents
is issued an open request. If this request fails then MIDIERR_HARDWARE_FAILED
is returned.
<P>
All other nodes are enabled by default.
<P>
If an application attempts to enable an instance for both directions simultaneously,
it is possible for one direction to succeed and for the other to fail. In
this case, the instance will be enabled for only one direction and the application
will not know which direction that is. This can happen when enabling a hardware
node or when the reference count for one direction (but not the other) exceeds
an internal limit. In the former case, MIDIERR_HARDWARE_FAILED is returned
and in the latter case, MIDIERR_RESOURCE_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
<P>
Therefore, it is suggested that an application make separate MIDIEnableInstance
calls to enable the instance for both directions. If the first call fails,
the application can then take appropriate measures.
