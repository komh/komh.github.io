<P>
The compound file structure is a RIFF-based structure upon which multimedia
file formats can be defined. The compound file structure is a parameterized
structure that provides for the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Storage of multimedia data elements<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Direct access to multimedia data elements (as opposed
to sequential searching)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The goals of the compound file structure are to maximize flexibility and
extensibility while minimizing implementation costs.  Using the compound
file structure, developers of multimedia data formats can define both simple
and complex file formats.
<P>
The structure is flexible enough to be used for many purposes, but it can
be simplified for use with simple file formats.  Designers of new multimedia
file formats can restrict the use of standard header fields, requiring some
and removing others.
<P>
For example, a developer might define a compound file format that stores
a series of bit maps in a single file, thus reducing compact disc seek times.
 Another developer might define a compound file format that contains a special
type of audio resource, using the compound file header information to identify
the attributes of the audio data stored within.
