<H1>Placement of the CTOC and CGRP Chunks</H1><!-- entering slot 2237 -->
<P>
The specific file format definition can specify which of the two chunks
appear first the data file.  Generally, the CTOC chunk is placed at the
front of the file to reduce the seek and read times required to access it.
 During authoring time, an application might place the CTOC chunk at the
end of the file, so it can be expanded as elements are added to the CGRP
chunk.
