<H1>Notation for Representing Sample RIFF Files</H1><!-- entering slot 2208 -->
<P>
RIFF is a binary format, but it is easier to comprehend as an ASCII representation
of a RIFF file.  This section defines a standard notation used to present
samples of various types of RIFF files.  If you define a RIFF form, we urge
you to use this notation in any file format samples you provide in your
documentation.
