<H1>The Stream Header 'strl' Chunks</H1><!-- entering slot 2243 -->
<P>
The main header is followed by one or more 'strl' chunks. A 'strl' chunk
is required for each data stream. These chunks contain information about
the streams in the file. Each 'strl' chunk must contain a stream header
and stream format chunk. Stream header chunks are identified by the 'strh'
four-character code and stream format chunks are identified by the 'strf'
four-character code. In addition to the stream header and stream format
chunks, the "strl" chunk might also contain a stream data chunk. Stream
data chunks are identified with the four-character code "strd".
<P>
The stream header has the following data structure defined for it:
<PRE>typedef struct {
    FOURCC fccType;
    FOURCC fccHandler;
    ULONG  ulFlags;
    ULONG  ulReserved1;
    ULONG  ulInitialFrames;
    ULONG  ulScale;
    ULONG  ulRate;
    ULONG  ulStart;
    ULONG  ulLength;
    ULONG  ulSuggestedBufferSize;
    ULONG  ulQuality;
    ULONG  ulSampleSize;
    ULONG  ulReserved[2];
} AVIStreamHeader;
</PRE>

<P>
The stream header specifies the type of data the stream contains, such as
audio or video, by means of a four-character code. The<I> fccType</I> field
is set to 'vids' if the stream it specifies contains video data. It is set
to 'auds' if it contains audio data.
<P>
The<I> fccHandler</I> field contains a four-character code describing the
installable decompressor used with the data.
<P>
The<I> ulFlags</I> field contains any flags for the data stream. The AVISF_DISABLED
flag indicates that the stream data should be rendered only when explicitly
enabled by the user.
<P>
The<I> ulInitialFrames</I> is used for interleaved files. If you are creating
interleaved files with audio skewing, specify the number of audio frames
in the file prior to the initial video frame of the AVI sequence in this
field.
<P>
The remaining fields describe the playback characteristics of the stream.
These factors include the playback rate (<I>ulScale</I> and<I> ulRate</I>),
the starting time of the sequence (<I>ulStart</I>), the length of the sequence
(<I>ulLength</I>), the size of the playback buffer (<I>ulSuggestedBuffer</I>),
an indicator of the data quality (<I>ulQuality</I>), and sample size (<I>ulSampleSize</I>).
See the reference section for more information on these fields.
<P>
Some of the fields in the stream header structure are also present in the
main header structure. The data in the main header structure applies to
the whole file while the data in the stream header structure applies only
to a stream.
<P>
A stream format 'strf' chunk must follow a stream header 'strh' chunk. The
stream format chunk describes the format of the data in the stream. For
video streams, the information in this chunk is a Windows BITMAPINFO structure
(including palette information if appropriate). For audio streams, the information
in this chunk is a Windows WAVEFORMATX or PCMWAVEFORMAT structure.
<P>
The 'strl' chunk might also contain a stream data 'strd' chunk. If used,
this chunk follows the stream format chunk. The format and content of this
chunk is defined by installable decompressors. Typically, decompressors
use this information for configuration. Applications that read and write
RIFF files do not need to decode this information. They transfer this data
to and from a decompressor as a memory block.
<P>
An AVI player associates the stream headers in the LIST 'hdrl' chunk with
the stream data in the LIST 'movi' chunk by using the order of the 'strl'
chunks. The first 'strl' chunk applies to stream 0, the second applies to
stream 1, and so forth. For example, if the first 'strl' chunk describes
the video data, the video data is contained in stream 0. Similarly, if the
second 'strl' chunk describes audio data, then the audio data is contained
in stream 1.
