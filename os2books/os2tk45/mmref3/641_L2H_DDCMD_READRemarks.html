<P>
This message is used by a stream handler to give an<I> empty</I> buffer
to the physical device driver. An example would be in an audio recording,
where the physical device driver fills the buffer it gets from the stream
handler. The<I> pBuffer</I> parameter is a pointer to the buffer to be filled
in by the physical device driver. This pointer is either a physical 0:32
pointer, 16:16 far pointer or a global linear pointer. This is defined when
the stream handler registers a stream with the device driver using <A HREF="644_L2_DDCMD_REG_STREAM.html">DDCMD_REG_STREAM</A>.

<P>
Many devices cannot handle a 0 length buffer. If the driver receives a 0
length buffer, it should not reject the buffer. The driver should do nothing
with the buffer and return it in the same order in which it was sent.
