<UL> Maximum
(ideal) number of buffers needed.  For normal streams, this means the number
of buffers that are allocated for the stream. For user-provided buffer streaming,
this means the number of buffers that the Sync/Stream Manager can queue
for a consumer. This can be used by a source stream handler that gives the
same set of buffers to the Sync/Stream Manager repeatedly.  If the number
of buffers is set to the number of buffers in the set -1, the source stream
handler will be able to detect when the target has consumed a buffer so
it can be reused. It is assumed that the set of buffers is an ordered set
and each buffer is used in the same order each time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
