<P>
All AVI files produced by OS/2 multimedia are interleaved. The audio stream
is divided into single frame pieces. The video and audio data for each frame
are grouped into 'rec' chunks.
<P>
Platforms, other than OS/2 multimedia, have additional requirements to playback
from CD-ROM devices. When OS/2 multimedia creates a file with the moderate
frame sizes and frame rates which these other platforms support, it performs
two additional steps to accommodate the the needs of these platforms:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Audio skewing
<P>
The audio data is skewed ahead of the video data by approximately 0.75 seconds.
For example, a 15 frame per second movie would have 12 audio frames skewed
ahead of the first video frame. The<I> ulInitialFrames</I> fields in the
main and video stream headers are set to the number of skewed frames.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Padding
<P>
The 'rec' chunks are padded so that their size is a multiple of 2 kilobytes
and so that the beginning of the actual data in the LIST chunk lies on a
2 kilobyte boundary.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
OS/2 multimedia does not require either padding or skewing to playback from
CD-ROM. However, to maintain compatibility with platforms, skewing and padding
are performed on files with moderate data rates. Movie files with data rates
less than or equal to the nominal data rate of an uncompressed 15 frame
per second movie with a frame size of 160 by 120 pels are skewed and padded.
This allows other platforms to playback these files.
<P>
However, OS/2 multimedia supports movies with nominal frame sizes of 320
by 240 pels at 15 frames per second. CD-ROM data rates do not permit the
wasted bandwidth required by padding at this large frame rate. Files with
these large data rate requirements are not padded.
