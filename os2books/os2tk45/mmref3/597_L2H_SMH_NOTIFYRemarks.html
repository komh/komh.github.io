<H1>SMH_NOTIFY - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 597 -->
<P>
This message is used to get or return an empty or full buffer, depending
on whether the stream handler is a target or source of data.  The message
can return or request not only the next available buffer, but also the next
<I>n</I> buffers.  For example, a target stream handler can request the
next 3 available full buffers, instead of the next available buffer, if
it needs to speed up its consumption of buffers.
<P>
The target stream handler should return the empty buffers in the reverse
order in which they were retrieved from the Sync/Stream Manager.  The target
stream handler must be able to accept a NULL buffer pointer on a BUF_GETFULL
request because the BUF_EOS flag may be set, but there may not be any buffers
left to consume.
<P>
All buffers allocated by the Sync/Stream Manager are fixed and cannot be
swapped.
<P>
The Sync/Stream Manager provides the ability for a source stream handler
to associate one cue point with a buffer that it passes to the Sync/Stream
Manager.  This buffer and attribute remain in the data stream until the
target stream handler requests it. The attribute for the buffer is passed
with the buffer to the target. See the<I> ulMessageParm</I> and<I> mmtimeOffset
</I>parameters for a description of the buffer attribute. The target stream
handler then must report an EVENT_PLAYLISTCUEPOINT event, at the appropriate
time, with the buffer attribute as the message parameter (the<I> ulMessageParm
</I>field in the <A HREF="1997_L2_PLAYL_EVCB.html">PLAYL_EVCB</A> structure).

<P>
This source stream handler feature of the Sync/Stream Manager supports the
memory-playlist ability to send a cue-point event as close to the actual
time it occurs as possible.  For this to work, it must be the target stream
handler that detects the cue-point event and reports it to the application
media control driver.  If the system-memory stream handler is the source
stream handler, it must notify the target stream handler to report a cue-point
event.
<P>
The contents of the<I> ulMessageParm</I> parameter are defined by the user
application. For example, if the system-memory stream handler is the source
stream handler, and it receives a playlist from the user application, the
playlist CUEPOINT instruction defines the contents of the buffer attribute
passed to the target stream handler. The target stream handler then reports
the event and passes the buffer attribute as an event parameter.
<P>
For split streams, a buffer can be divided into multiple variable-length
records. This is useful for streaming interleaved data from one source stream
handler, in multiple streams, to one or more target stream handlers, where
each stream represents a different data type.
<P>
The source stream handler requests one buffer at a time from the Sync/Stream
Manager and returns filled records to the Sync/Stream Manager.  The source
stream handler specifies which stream the records will go in.  Each stream
goes to a different target stream handler.  The<I> pRecord</I> field of
the pointer table are not used for normal non-split streams. The source
stream handler can return multiple records of a specific data type to a
stream, but these all must be contained within the same buffer.  The last
record of each buffer is indicated by using the BUF_LASTRECORD flag; it
is only sent to the stream that receives the last record for a buffer.  The
BUF_EOS flag, on the other hand, is sent to all streams when the last buffer
or record is returned to the Sync/Stream Manager.
<P>
The SMH_NOTIFY message also can accept user-provided buffers into a stream
to be passed directly from the source stream handler to the target stream
handler.  This is accomplished with the BUF_GIVEBUF flag, which enables
the source stream handler to<I> give</I> a buffer and length to the Sync/Stream
Manager eventually to be passed to the target stream handler for a BUF_GETFULL
request.  Each buffer given to the Sync/Stream Manager is used once.  The
BUF_GIVEBUF is only available on DLL SMH_NOTIFY calls.  The Sync/Stream
Manager returns ERROR_TOO_MANY_BUFFERS to the source stream handler if it
attempts to give too many buffers.  The BUF_GIVEBUF feature is provided
primarily for the memory stream handler to be able to stream data from an
application's memory.
<P>
For DLL stream handlers, all pointers returned are 32-bit flat process linear
addresses.  For device driver stream handlers, pointers returned in an SMH_NOTIFY
message are either 32-bit, flat, global linear addresses, physical addresses,
or<I> GDT</I> selector and offset addresses.  The latter is the default.
 The others are selectable for each SMH_NOTIFY message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The physical addresses are pointers to physically contiguous
memory, not a page table.  The SPCBBUF_NONCONTIGUOUS bit must not be set
to On in the <A HREF="2102_L2_SPCB.html"><!-- entering slot 598 -->SPCB
</A>to get a physical address from the Sync/Stream Manager.  The Sync/Stream
Manager fails requests for physical addresses if this bit is set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Any combination of BUF_GETEMPTY and BUF_RETURNFULL can be used for the same
SMH_NOTIFY function.

Either BUF_LINEAR or BUF_PHYSICAL can be used with any combination of BUF_GETEMPTY,
