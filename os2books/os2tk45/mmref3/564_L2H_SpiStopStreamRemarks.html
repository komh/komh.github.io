<P>
Three possible types of stops can be issued:  pause, discard, and flush.
 The pause stop immediately pauses the stream by sending an <A HREF="833_L2_SHC_STOP.html">SHC_STOP
</A>call to both the source and target stream handlers.  Both stream handlers
must become idle and not request any more buffers from the Sync/Stream Manager.
 The Sync/Stream Manager will fail any "get buffer" requests, so that a
stream handler cannot continue to stream.  All stream data remains valid.
The stream can be restarted by issuing <A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream</A>.

<P>
The discard stop immediately stops the stream by sending an <A HREF="833_L2_SHC_STOP.html">SHC_STOP
</A>call to both the source and target stream handlers.  Both stream handlers
must return all buffers to the Sync/Stream Manager.  The Sync/Stream Manager
fails any "get buffer" requests, so that a stream handler cannot continue
to stream.  Any data currently in the stream buffers is discarded.  The
stream can be restarted after a discard stop. The stream time is adjusted
to the time at the point the stream was stopped.
<P>
The flush stop sends an <A HREF="833_L2_SHC_STOP.html">SHC_STOP</A> call
to both the source and target stream handlers.  The stream does not stop,
however.  The source stream handler must not request any more buffers from
the Sync/Stream Manager.  It must return all buffers to the Sync/Stream
Manager. The Sync/Stream Manager fails any "get buffer" requests from the
source stream handler, so that it cannot continue to fill buffers.  The
target stream handler continue to stream data until all buffers are emptied.
The stream can be restarted, with no loss of data.
<P>
For discard and flush stops, the Sync/Stream Manager detects when the stream
handlers have stopped and returned all buffers.  At this point, the Sync/Stream
Manager notifies the application with an EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED event message.
 In the case of a sync group, there will be one EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED event
for each stream that is stopped.  Any stream in the sync group that was
previously stopped, either by an explicit <A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream
</A>or by reaching the end of the stream, does not trigger an EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED
event.
<P>
If a stream is paused and the application issues a discard stop, the stream
buffers are discarded and the stream is put in a stopped state.  If a stream
is paused and a flush stop is issued, the remaining stream buffer data is
transferred to the target stream handler. In other words, the stream begins
<I>playing</I> again.
<P>
This function returns an error if a flush stop is issued for a prerolled
stream that has not been started.  A flush or pause stop is not valid while
a stream is being prerolled.  If a pause stop is issued to a prerolled stream,
the stream is still considered to be prerolled and not paused.
<P>
Slave streams can be stopped independently of the master stream.  When the
slave stream stops, the sync relationship is not broken, but the slave becomes
idle.  The master stream and any other slave streams continue running. If
the stopped slave is restarted, a new master-to-slave time offset is established,
which the slave stream maintains until it is either stopped again, or the
master stream is stopped.  As a result, slave streams can regain synchronization
at any asynchronous point in time, as in response to another stream event
from the master stream, for example.
<P>
Slave-stream time and master-stream time are not always identical. Once
a slave stream is stopped, the master stream time can continue to increment.
 When the slave stream is restarted, its stream time increments at the same
rate as the master stream.  Any slave stream in a synchronization relationship
can be started arbitrarily or stopped without affecting the activity of
the master stream or any of the slave streams.  When the SPI_STOP_SLAVES
flag is set, the master stream, as well as the slave streams, stops.
<P>
Typically, data streaming continues until the end of the stream. When this
happens, the Sync/Stream Manager sends an EVENT_EOS event message to the
application's event routine.  In the case of a sync group, there is one
EVENT_EOS message per stream.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function should not be used during exit-list processing
because it is asynchronous and the event for completion of the function
will never be sent.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
