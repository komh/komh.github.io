<UL> This
field is a set of bit flags with various meanings.  These flags are set
by the Sync/Stream Manager only.  These flags can be reset by a slave stream
handler.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
SYNCOVERRUN<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> This flag is set by the Sync/Stream
Manager if a synchronization pulse is reported by the master stream handler
before the slave stream handler has processed the existing synchronization
pulse.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>SYNCPOLLING<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> This flag is set by the Sync/Stream
Manager to indicate to a slave stream that a synchronization pulse has been
reported by the master stream handler. The SYNC_EVCB fields (<I>mmtimeStart
</I>and<I> mmtimeMaster</I>) are filled in by the Sync/Stream Manager before
this bit flag is set. It is the responsibility of the slave stream handler
to reset this flag to indicate that the synchronization pulse has been processed.
