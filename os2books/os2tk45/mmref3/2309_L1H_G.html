<UL> An adapter that controls
the interface between the PC, Personal Computer XT*, or Personal Computer
AT* and, for example, the InfoWindow display; also known as the IBM IEEE
488.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> genlock</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> A
device that comes on an adapter or plugs into a computer port and provides
the technology to overlay computer-generated titles and graphics onto video
images.  It does this by phase-<I>lock</I>ing the sync<I> gen</I>eration
of two video signals together so they can be merged. Genlock also converts
a digital signal to NTSC or PAL format.  (For example, flying logos and
scrolling text on television shows are overlaid using a genlock.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

capabilities.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> graphics overlay</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> The
nature of dual plane video systems makes it possible to place graphics over
video.  Only the pels of the designated transparent color allows the video
to show through.  All other graphics pels appear on top of the video.  Note
that the video still exists in the video buffer under the non-transparent
graphics pels.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> graphics plane</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> In
a dual plane video system, the graphics plane contains material drawn or
generated by the graphics adapter.  The graphics plane will be combined
with the video plane to create an entire display image.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> For
Media Control Interface devices, refers to the ability to associate dissimilar
devices for a common purpose.  Grouping MCI devices aids resource management
