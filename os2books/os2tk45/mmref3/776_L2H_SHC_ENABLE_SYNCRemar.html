<P>
Commands a stream handler to be either a master stream handler (generates
sync pulses) or a slave stream handler (receives sync pulses) in a synchronized-stream
group. Only one stream handler from each stream can be a master or slave
in a synchronized-stream group.  Only one stream handler will ever be the
master.  All slave stream handlers must return a <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB
</A>to be used for the sync-pulse notification. Optionally, the stream handler
also can provide a system semaphore that is posted by the Sync/Stream Manager
during a sync-pulse notification.  Otherwise, the stream handler must poll
the EVCB_SYNCPOLLING bit in the <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB
</A>to check for sync notification from the Sync/Stream Manager.  When a
sync notification occurs, the<I> ulStatus</I> field of the <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB
</A>contains the sync time.
<P>
Sync pulses are distributed by the Sync/Stream Manager, based on the stream
group.  This distribution is effective for both DLL and device driver slave
stream handlers.  Device driver stream handlers receive sync pulses through
their <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB</A> Each slave stream handler
must the sync pulse <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB</A> regularly
with its calculated stream time.  The Sync/Stream Manager checks the slave-handler
stream time against the master stream time and determines whether to send
a sync pulse to this handler.
<P>
Device driver stream handlers check for sync pulses from the Sync/Stream
Manager by polling a flag in the sync-pulse <A HREF="2131_L2_SYNC_EVCB.html">SYNC_EVCB</A>.
The Sync/Stream Manager sets the flag to indicate a sync pulse and updates
the current master-handler stream time. Typically, the device driver slave
handler polls the flag once during interrupt processing and adjusts the
stream consumption accordingly.
<P>
DLL stream handlers receive sync pulses in one of two ways: by registering
a semaphore with the Sync/Stream Manager, or by the same method the Sync/Stream
Manager uses for device driver stream handlers. DLL stream handlers then
can process the sync pulse in the context of a time-critical thread (created
by the stream handler at stream creation time).
<P>
The optional semaphore handle returned from the stream handler must be a
16-bit system semaphore instead of 32-bit event or 32-bit mutex semaphore
because of a limitation of the device driver model.  Currently, device drivers
can use only 16-bit semaphores.
