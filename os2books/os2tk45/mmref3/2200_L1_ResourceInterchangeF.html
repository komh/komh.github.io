<P>
RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) is the tagged file structure developed
for multimedia resource files. The structure of a RIFF file is similar to
the structure of an Electronic Arts Interchange File Format file (EA IFF).
RIFF is not actually a file format itself (because it does not represent
a specific kind of information), but its name contains the words "interchange
file format" in recognition of its roots in IFF.
<P>
RIFF has a counterpart, RIFX, that is used to define RIFF file formats that
use the Motorola** integer byte-ordering format rather than the Intel**
format.  A RIFX file is the same as a RIFF file, except that the first four
bytes are 'RIFX' instead of 'RIFF', and integer byte ordering is represented
in Motorola format.
