<P>
After this function is issued, the event handle for the event can no longer
be used. The event is removed from the system for the particular stream
instance. When any given event is reported, it is not removed automatically
from the system; it must be removed explicitly using this function. Once
an event is removed from the system, the event no longer is detected or
reported to the application or media control driver.
