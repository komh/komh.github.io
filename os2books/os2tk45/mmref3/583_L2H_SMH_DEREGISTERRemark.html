A stream handler can use this message to deregister itself with the Sync/Stream
Manager.  For example, if a stream handler DLL comes across an error condition
that requires termination of its worker thread, the stream handler must
deregister with the Sync/Stream Manager because it no longer can support
calls.  This is used mostly by the device driver stream handler in the case
where the device driver receives an error and is no longer callable.
