<H1>Unregistered (Form-Specific) Chunk Types</H1><!-- entering slot 2207 -->
<P>
Chunk types that are used only in a certain form type use a lowercase chunk
ID.  A lowercase chunk ID has specific meaning only within the context of
a specific form type.  After a form designer is allocated a registered form
type, the designer can choose lowercase chunk types to use within that form.
 See <A HREF="2199_L2_RegisteringMultimedi.html">Registering Multimedia
Formats</A> for information on registering form types.
<P>
For example, a chunk with ID 'scln' inside one form type might contain the
"number of scan lines." Inside some other form type, a chunk with ID 'scln'
might mean "secondary lambda number."
