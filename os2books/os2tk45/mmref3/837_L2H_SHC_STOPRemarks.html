<H1>SHC_STOP - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 838 -->
<P>
Commands the stream handler to stop streaming data.  The flags will indicate
the type of stop (discard, flush, pause) initiated through SPI.  The<I> pause
stop</I> immediately pauses the stream by sending an SHC_STOP message to
both the source and target stream handlers.  Both stream handlers must shut
down and not request any more buffers from the Sync/Stream Manager.  The
Sync/Stream Manager fails any<I> get buffer</I> requests, so that a stream
handler cannot continue to stream.  All stream data remains valid.  The
stream can be restarted by issuing <A HREF="547_L2_SpiStartStream.html">SpiStartStream</A>.

<P>
The<I> discard stop</I> immediately stops the stream by sending an SHC_STOP
message to both the source and target stream handlers.  Both stream handlers
must shut down and not request any more buffers from the Sync/Stream Manager.
 But they must return all buffers to the Sync/Stream Manager.  The Sync/Stream
Manager fails any<I> get buffer</I> requests, so that a stream handler cannot
continue to stream.  All stream data is discarded.  The stream can be restarted,
but the data in the discarded buffers is lost.
<P>
The<I> flush stop</I> sends an SHC_STOP message to both the source and target
stream handlers.  The stream does not stop, however.  The source stream
handler must shut down and not request any more buffers from the Sync/Stream
Manager.  It must return any buffers to the Sync/Stream Manager.  The Sync/Stream
Manager fails any<I> get buffer</I> requests from the source stream handler,
so that it cannot continue to fill buffers.  The target stream handler continues
to stream data until all buffers are empty.  The stream can be restarted
with no loss of data.
<P>
For discard and flush stops, the Sync/Stream Manager detects when the stream
handlers have stopped and returned all buffers.  At this point, the Sync/Stream
Manager notifies the application media control device with an EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED
message.  Also, both stream handlers must return all owned buffers to the
Sync/Stream Manager before the stream EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED message is sent
to the application media control device.
<P>
If a stream is paused and the application issues a discard stop, the stream
buffers is discarded and the stream is put in a stopped state.  If a stream
is paused and a flush stop is issued, the remaining stream buffers is transferred
to the target stream handler.  In other words, the stream begins<I> playing
</I>again.
<P>
Slave streams can be stopped independently of the master stream.  When a
slave stream stops, the synchronized relationship is not broken, but the
slave stream is quiesced.  The master stream and any other slaves continue
to stream.  If the stopped slave stream is restarted, a new master-to-slave
time offset is established which the slave stream maintains until it is
either stopped again, or the master is stopped.  This enables slave streams
to regain synchronization at any asynchronous point in time, for example,
in response to another stream event from the master.  Slave stream time
and master-stream time are not always identical.  Once a slave stream is
stopped, the master stream time can continue to increment.  When the slave
stream is restarted, its stream time increments at the same rate as the
master stream.  Any slave in a synchronized relationship can be arbitrarily
started or stopped without affecting the activity of the master stream or
any other slave stream.  When the SPI_STOP_SLAVES flag is set, the master
streams, as well as the slave streams stop.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Typically, data streaming continues until the end of the stream.
 Then the Sync/Stream Manager sends an EVENT_EOS message to the application
media control device's event routine.  The Sync/Stream Manager detects EVENT_EOS
and EVENT_STREAM_STOPPED and notifies the application.  Therefore, the stream
handler does not report these events to the Sync/Stream Manager.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
