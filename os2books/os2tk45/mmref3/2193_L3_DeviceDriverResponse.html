<H1>Device Driver Response Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 2195 -->
<P>
The following are types of device driver response messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Device capability<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Device ID<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Queue size<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Device Capability Response</B>
<P>
This message is sent by a device driver in response to a query device capability
message (see <A HREF="2192_L3_DeviceDriverQueryMes.html">Device Driver Query
Messages</A>). It indicates the basic MIDI capability of the device driver.

<PRE>  F0 00 00 3A  05  01  <B>ii</B> <B>mm</B> 00 F7
  <B>ii</B> = Number of sound generators (instruments)
  <B>mm</B> = MIDI capability flags
       01xx xxxx MIDI input is supported
       0x1x xxxx MIDI output is supported
       0xx1 xxxx System real-time Timing clocks are supported
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Device ID Response</B>
<P>
This message identifies the device and is sent by a device driver in response
to a query device ID message (see <A HREF="2192_L3_DeviceDriverQueryMes.html">Device
Driver Query Messages</A>).
<PRE>  F0 00 00 3A  05  04  <B>b1</B> <B>b2</B> <B>b3</B> F7

  <B>b1</B> = 1st byte of Device ID
  <B>b2</B> = 2nd byte of Device ID
  <B>b3</B> = 3rd byte of Device ID
</PRE>

<P>
This message is provided to permit applications to perform device unique
operations such as issuing device-specific system exclusive messages.
<P>
<B>Queue Size Response</B>
<P>
This message is sent by a device driver in response to a query output queue
size message (see <A HREF="2192_L3_DeviceDriverQueryMes.html">Device Driver
Query Messages</A>). It indicates the total output queue size in bytes.

<PRE>  F0 00 00 3A  05  02  ll <B>mm</B> 00 F7

  <B>ll</B> = Lower 7 bits of queue size
  <B>mm</B> = Upper 7 bits of queue size
  (Queue Size in bytes = 00mm mmmm mlll llll)
</PRE>

<P>
For example, if the device driver's output queue is 512 bytes in length,
the returned data is:
<PRE>   F0 00 00 3A  05  02  00  04  00  F7
</PRE>
