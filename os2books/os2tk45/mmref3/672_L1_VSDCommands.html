<P>
The vendor-specific driver (VSD) interface is a generic device-driver like
interface that effectively decomposes the high-level media control interface
functions into more fundamental operations. The VSD layer resides in Ring
3 and provides a low-level function set that can keep pace with demanding
data control and transport requirements. A Ring 3 stream handler can use
the <A HREF="683_L2_VSD_DDCMD.html">VSD_DDCMD</A> command (described in
this section) for data transportation. For this Ring 3 DLL interface, all
pointers are 0:32 linear.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Refer to the<I> MMPM/2 Device Driver Reference</I> for a complete
description of the VSD interface definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The interface to the VSD is a specific entry point-<A HREF="673_L2_VSDEntry.html">VSDEntry</A>.
 First, issue DosLoadModule for the VSD's DLL.  The DosLoadModule function
returns a handle for the VSD.  Next, using the VSD handle, call DosQueryProcAddr
to receive the VSD entry point address.  This must be done prior to issuing
any VSD commands.  Once the entry point address is received, calls to the
VSD can be made with <A HREF="673_L2_VSDEntry.html">VSDEntry</A>.
