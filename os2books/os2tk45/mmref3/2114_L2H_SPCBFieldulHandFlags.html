<UL>
<P>
<B>ulHandFlags</B> (<A HREF="2162_L2_ULONG.html">ULONG</A>)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Stream
handler flags (that is, handlers can generate/receive sync pulses, use the
Sync/Stream Manager timer as master, and use the non-streaming handler as
a NULL handler).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
SPCBHAND_GENSYNC<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This stream handler can generate
sync pulses.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_GENTIME<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
stream handler can keep track of the real stream time. This handler also
supports the <A HREF="498_L2_SpiGetTime.html">SpiGetTime</A> function and
cue point events.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_NOPREROLL<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
stream handler cannot preroll its device (that is, for recording streams,
the source stream handler cannot be prerolled). If asked to preroll this
stream, the Sync/Stream Manager treats this stream as if it were prerolled.
<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL>SPCBHAND_NONSTREAM<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
stream handler is a non-streaming handler (that is, it is a stream handler
that can participate in synchronization but does not stream).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_NOSYNC
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>This stream handler can be in a sync group but
does not receive or generate sync pulses. (It is useful to group streams
so that they can be manipulated as a group).<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_PHYS_SEEK
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>This stream handler does a seek to a physical device.
 Other stream handlers adjust stream time only on a seek request.  The Sync/Stream
Manager always calls this stream handler first in an <A HREF="522_L2_SpiSeekStream.html">SpiSeekStream
</A>call.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_RCVSYNC<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
stream handler can receive sync pulses.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> SPCBHAND_TIMER
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>This stream handler or the device (driver) it communicates
with cannot support generation of sync pulses on a granularity necessary
for synchronization.  Therefore, use the stream manager sync timer as the
master timer in a sync group.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
