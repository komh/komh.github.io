<H1>Timing Compression Messages</H1><!-- entering slot 2198 -->
<P>
These messages are used to compress sequential timing clocks (F8) into a
single system exclusive message.  Up to 16383 (that is, F8 Timing clocks
can be compressed into a single 6- or 8-byte message, which can be written
to a device driver to cause a delay between output events if output synchronizing
is enabled (see <A HREF="2191_L3_DeviceDriverControlM.html">Device Driver
Control Messages</A>).
<PRE> F0  00 00 3A  01  <B>ll</B>  <B>mm</B>  F7  (Long version)
 F0  00 00 3A  <B>nn</B>  F7          (Short version)

 <B>ll</B> = Number of System Real Time Timing Clocks LSB
 <B>mm</B> = Number of System Real Time Timing Clocks MSB
 <B>nn</B> = Number of System Real Time Timing Clocks (nn = 7 through 127)
</PRE>

<P>
The short version can be used to represent durations of from 7 - 127 clocks.
 Longer durations can be represented with the long version, where the number
of timing clocks that have occurred is calculated by combining the low 7-bits
of<I> mm</I> with the low 7-bits of<I> ll</I> to produce a single 16-bit
value:
<PRE>   0mmm mmmm + 0lll llll = 00mm mmmm mlll llll
