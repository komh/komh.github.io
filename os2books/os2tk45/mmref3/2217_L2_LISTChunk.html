<H1>LIST Chunk</H1><!-- entering slot 2219 -->
<P>
A LIST chunk contains a list, or ordered sequence, of subchunks. A LIST
chunk is defined as follows:
<PRE>LIST( &lt;list-type&gt; [&lt;chunk&gt;]... )
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> &lt;list-type&gt;</B> is a four-character code that identifies the
contents of the list.
<P>
If an application recognizes the list type, it should know how to interpret
the sequence of subchunks. However, since a LIST chunk may contain only
subchunks (after the list type), an application that does not know about
a specific list type can still walk through the sequence of subchunks.
<P>
Like chunk IDs, list types must be registered, and an all-lowercase list
type has meaning relative to the form that contains it. See <A HREF="2199_L2_RegisteringMultimedi.html">Registering
Multimedia Formats</A> for information on registering list types.
