<P>
Device driver stream handlers communicate with the hardware PDD through
the DDCmdEntryPoint.  This is accomplished through the use of Device Driver
Command (DDCMD) messages, which enable a stream handler to request a PDD
to perform functions such as starting, stopping, or resuming operation of
a device.  This interface uses the IDC mechanism provided by the ATTACHDD
DevHelp function.  The stream handler must attach to the device driver to
receive the DDCMD entry point address of the device driver.  This function
is performed prior to issuing device driver command messages.
