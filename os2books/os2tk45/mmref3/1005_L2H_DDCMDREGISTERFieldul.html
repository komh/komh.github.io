<B>ulBufSize</B> (<A HREF="2162_L2_ULONG.html">ULONG</A>)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Specifies
VSD or PDD output buffer size in bytes that will be sent to the driver.
The caller will fill in a default value. If the device driver does not override
this value, it will be used to determine the buffer size.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The device driver sets this field to indicate the buffer size
that it would like to receive from the streaming subsystem. For MIDI, this
field is usually set to 512. For DMA-based audio or other systems where
the interrupt rate equals the buffer rate, this field should be set to about
1/30 the quantity of data consumed or produced per second. This field supplies
the system with a minimal buffer size for wave audio. Because other system
elements also negotiate to determine buffer size and for software motion
video, the system might provide buffers smaller than the size requested.
