<P>
This message creates a stream instance with<I> hstream</I> as the handle.
 The Sync/Stream Manager calls both the source and target stream handlers
during an <A HREF="367_L2_SpiCreateStream.html">SpiCreateStream</A> call
from the application or media driver.  The stream handler must pass back
a pointer to an <A HREF="2102_L2_SPCB.html">SPCB</A> so that the Sync/Stream
Manager can negotiate the stream parameters.  The Sync/Stream Manager calls
<A HREF="806_L2_SHC_NEGOTIATE_RESULT.html">SHC_NEGOTIATE_RESULT</A> with
the results of the stream negotiation.  Device driver stream handlers must
perform the OS/2 function AttachDD (DevHelp service), based on the device
information in the device control block.
<P>
Stream handlers must be able to handle multiple stream instances.  These
stream instances are created when an SHC_CREATE message is received from
the Sync/Stream Manager.  The stream handler should create any stream instance
control structures at this point.
