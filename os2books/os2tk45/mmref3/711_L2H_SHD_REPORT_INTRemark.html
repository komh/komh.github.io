<P>
This message is a mechanism for the physical device driver to return status,
indicate that the buffer has been consumed, or indicate that a new buffer
is needed.
<P>
When status is returned, you will know whether the playback or record was
successful or if there was an error condition.  Error conditions for playback
are known as<I> underruns</I>, which means the device is not getting data
fast enough.  Error conditions for records are called<I> overruns</I>, which
means the device is generating data faster than empty buffers become available.
 This might result in a data loss situation.  For example, the device is
constantly bringing in data from the analog ports of the adapter and converting
it to digital data.  If the device does not have any empty buffers to store
the digital data, the data is lost.
<P>
If you report an underrun under Warp and want the stream handler to pause
the device, you should report the ERROR_DEVICE_UNDERRUN as well as the SHD_WRITE_COMPLETE
flags.
<P>
The VSD must return buffers in the order they were sent and should not hold
on to any buffers. Failure to return buffers could result in application
hangs.
