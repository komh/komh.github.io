<P>
The following figure illustrates the subsystem components provided by the
OS/2 multimedia system.  These subsystems (media control drivers, stream
handlers, and I/O procedures) are controlled by<I> managers</I> that oversee
a range of activities in the OS/2 multimedia environment.
<P>
At the Ring 3 level, OS/2 multimedia employs a<I> Media Device Manager (MDM)</I>,
which manages logical media devices representing audio adapters, CD-ROM
drives, and other hardware devices.  Amongst its duties, MDM determines
which process gains access when two or more applications attempt to control
a media device.
<P>
The<I> Sync/Stream Manager (SSM)</I> is also available to manage streaming
and synchronization calls initiated by the media control drivers.  This
eliminates the need for each media driver to provide its own solution for
these common multimedia requirements.  Pairs of stream handlers implement
the transport of data from a source to a target device while the SSM provides
coordination and central management of data buffers and synchronization
data.
<P>
Lastly, the<I> MMIO Manager</I> enables subsystem components such as media
control drivers and applications to access and manipulate a variety of data
objects, including images, graphics, digital audio, and digital video.  These
objects can be stored in a variety of file formats on a variety of storage
systems.  The MMIO Manager uses installable I/O procedures to direct the
input and output associated with reading from and writing to different types
of storage systems or file formats.
