<H1>I/O Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
Multimedia input/output (MMIO) services provides both I/O and CODEC procedures.
 I/O procedures are message-based handlers, which direct the input and output
associated with reading and writing to different types of storage systems
or file formats.  Applications and the MMIO subsystem communicate to I/O
procedures (DLL files) through the use of MMIO messages.  When MMIO receives
a request from an application through a function call, the MMIO Manager
sends a predefined message for that operation to the I/O procedure responsible
for that particular file format or storage system.  In turn, the I/O procedure
performs operations based on the messages it receives from the MMIO Manager
or an application.
<P>
These messages are designed for efficient communications to all I/O procedures.
 The I/O procedures, however, must be able to process the messages or pass
them on to a child I/O procedure.  For example, if an I/O procedure receives
a message requesting the compression of data object, the I/O procedure must
be able to process the message, or pass the message to a CODEC procedure.
The following figure illustrates the interaction of I/O and CODEC procedures
in the MMIO subsystem.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="008_L2_IOProcedures_3.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=480>

The MMIO Manager calls the following types of procedures:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
File Format<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> A file format procedure is an I/O procedure
that manipulates data at the element level, with each procedure handling
a different element type such as audio, image, or MIDI.  It processes the
data "within" the object and does not rely on any other file format I/O
procedures to process the data.  However, a file format procedure might
need to call a storage system I/O procedure to obtain data within a file
containing multiple elements.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Storage System<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> A
storage system procedure is an I/O procedure that "unwraps" a data object
for a file format procedure to access.  Storage system procedures are unaware
of the format of the data object contained within the wrapper.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CODEC
<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL>A CODEC procedure operates on data within a file
or buffer.  Based on the data content, an I/O procedure can load a CODEC
procedure to either compress or decompress data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
