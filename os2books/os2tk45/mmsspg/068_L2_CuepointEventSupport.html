<H1>Cuepoint Event Support</H1><!-- entering slot 85 -->
<P>
In certain instances it is not appropriate for a source stream handler to
report cuepoints to an application (or media driver), but to allow the target
to report the cuepoint. Usually, an application awaiting a cuepoint wants
to receive it at the time the data is being output on the target side of
a stream. One such circumstance involves the System Memory Stream Handler.

<P>
The System Memory Stream Handler has the ability to stream data from a<I> playlist.
</I>A<I> playlist</I> is basically a little program that specifies what
memory objects from a user application should be streamed and in what order.
It consists of control information to enable looping, branching, and subroutines
calls within the playlist. Another feature of a playlist is the CUEPOINT
instruction, which allows the playlist to specify where in the data stream
that cuepoints need to be sent to the application. Since the playlist is
"played" within the source stream handler, it needs to notify the target
stream handler to report the cuepoint at the appropriate time in the data
stream.
<P>
The Sync/Stream Manager provides the ability for a source stream handler
to associate a cuepoint with a buffer that it passes to the target stream
handler (through the Sync/Stream Manager). This buffer and attribute remain
in the data stream until the target stream handler requests it. The attribute
for the buffer is passed with the buffer to the target (refer to the SMH_NOTIFY
message in the<I> OS/2 Multimedia Programming Reference</I>). The target
stream handler must then flag the event (for example, EVENT_CUE_DATA) when
it receives a buffer with a non-zero attribute. The value of the attribute
is passed as a parameter to the event on the SMH_REPORTEVENT call to the
Sync/Stream Manager.
<P>
This feature of the Sync/Stream Manager supports the memory playlist ability
to send a cuepoint event as close to actual time it occurs as possible.
For this to work, it must be the target stream handler that must flag the
cuepoint event to the application, in this case the media driver. If the
System Memory Stream Handler is the source stream handler, it must notify
the target stream handler to flag a cuepoint event. Refer to the<I> OS/2
Multimedia Programming Reference</I> for more information on playlists.
