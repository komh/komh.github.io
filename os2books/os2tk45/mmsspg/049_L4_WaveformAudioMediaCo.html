up).
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>AUDIOMCD.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes the
MCIDRV_RESTORE message.  A streaming MCD will receive a restore message
when it regains control of the device they are attached to (for example,
someone quit another application causing us to gain use of the device).
 On a restore, the MCD should check to see if it is in a paused state.  If
so, resume the stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>  <!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes
the MCIDRV_SAVE message.  A streaming MCD will receive a save message when
it loses control of the device it is attached to (for example, someone started
another application which takes over the waveaudio device).  On a save,
the MCD should check to see if the MCD is currently streaming (either record
or playback).  If so, pause the stream, and set a flag stating that the
MCD was saved.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ADMCLOAD.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes
the MCI_LOAD message.  This file illustrates the following concepts: 1.
How to check flags on a load.
<BR>
2. How to stop any commands which are in process.
<BR>
3. Why cuepoints/positionadvises need to be turned off on a MCI_LOAD.
<BR>
4. Handling OPEN_MMIO on an MCI_LOAD.
<BR>

<BR>
  when it is appropriate.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCCAP.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes the
MCI_GETDEVCAPS message.  This file illustrates several concepts used to
handle MCI_GETDEVCAPS including: 1. How to process the capability message
commands.
<BR>
  These are messages which this MCD supports (such as play, close etc.)
<BR>
  Messages (or commands to the caller) such as sysinfo are
<BR>
  not supported by this MCD.
<BR>
2. How to process the capability item flag.
<BR>
  Items describe particular features (such as the ability to record)
<BR>
  which the MCD either does or does not support.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCSTAT.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->

<BR>
  being recorded.
<BR>
4. Communicating with the amp/mixer to determine volume,
<BR>
  and other amplifier specific commands.

<BR>
6. Reporting the current time format.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCCUE.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes the
MCI_CUE message.  Applications will typically<!-- entering slot 57 --> call
MCI_CUE in order to reduce the time required to begin the initial record
or play.  To a streaming MCD, MCI_CUE translates to an SPI_START_PREROLL.
 The start preroll will fill up all of the initial streaming buffers but
will not start the stream. Then, when MCI_PLAY or MCI_RECORD are called,
when they do an SpiStartStream then stream can start immediately.
<P>
On an MCI_CUE, a streaming MCD should perform the following actions: 1.
Check flags and validate pointers.
<BR>
2. Check to see if the stream is already in cue state.  If it is, then
<BR>
  just return success.
<BR>
3. If the caller wants to cue for output, execute the following:
<BR>
  a. stop any in process commands.
<BR>
  b. If the stream is going in the wrong direction (that is, record),
<BR>
   destroy it.
<BR>
  c. Create the stream if necessary.
<BR>
  d. Preroll start the stream.
<BR>

<BR>
4. If the caller wants to cue for input, execute the following:
<BR>
  a. Stop any in process commands.
<BR>
  b. If the stream is going in the wrong direction, destroy it.
<BR>
  c. Create the stream if necessary.
<BR>
  d. Preroll start the stream.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Processes the MCI_SET_CUEPOINT
message.  On a MCI_SET_CUEPOINT, a streaming MCD should perform the following
actions: 1. Check flags and validate pointers.
<BR>
2. Turn the cuepoint on or off depending on what flags are passed in.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
ADMCSEEK.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->

<BR>
  stopped state.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCPLAY.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes the
MCI_PLAY message.  On a MCI_PLAY, a streaming MCD should perform the following
actions: 1. Always check flags and validate memory first.  This way,
<BR>
  if the flags are invalid, the previous command will not be interrupted.
<BR>
2. If there is a command active on another thread (that is, a play,
<BR>
  record or save), then either abort (record or save) or supersede
<BR>
  (play) by stopping the stream and sending a message to the caller.
<BR>
3. If the stream is going the wrong way (for example,
<BR>
  it is set up for recording) then destroy the stream.
<BR>
4. If no stream has been created, then create one.  If the stream handler

<BR>
  needs to associate a data object, do it here.
<BR>
5. If we destroyed a recording stream before creating the play back stream,
<BR>
  ensure that playback stream has the same position as the previous
<BR>
  record stream.
<BR>
6. Enable any events (such as cuepoints or position advises).
<BR>
7. Start stream.
<BR>
8. Wait for a streaming event.
<BR>
9. Stop the stream if necessary.
<BR>
10.If MCI_NOTIFY was sent used, inform the caller of command completion.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCRECD.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Processes the
MCI_RECORD message.  On a MCI_RECORD, a streaming MCD should perform the
following actions: 1. Always check flags and validate memory first.  This
way, if the flags
<BR>
  are invalid, the previous command will not be interrupted.
<BR>
2. If there is a command active on another thread (that is,
<BR>
  a play, record or save), then either abort (play or save)
<BR>
  or supersede (record) by stopping the stream and sending
<BR>
  a message to the caller.
<BR>
3. If the stream is going the wrong way (for example,
<BR>
  it is setup for playback) then destroy the stream.
<BR>
4. If no stream has been created, then create one.  If the stream handler

<BR>
  needs to associate a data object, do it here.
<BR>
5. If we destroyed a play back stream before creating the record stream,
<BR>
  seek to the same position in the record stream where the play back
<BR>
  stream was.
<BR>
6. Enable any events (such as cuepoints or position advises).
<BR>
7. Start stream.
<BR>
8. Wait for a streaming event.
<BR>
9. Stop the stream if necessary.
<BR>
10.If MCI_NOTIFY was sent used, inform the caller of command completion.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>ADMCCLOS.C<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->

the MCI_STOP message.  On a stop, a streaming MCD should perform the following
actions: 1. Verify that the flags passed are valid.
<BR>
2. Stop any commands which are active on another thread.
<BR>
3. If a stream had previously been created, ensure that it is in
<BR>
  stopped state.

<BR>
  no data will be lost.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Processes the MCI_RESUME
message.  On a MCI_RESUME, a streaming MCD should perform the following
actions: 1. Ensure that no flags are passed in.

2. If we are paused, resume the stream.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Processes the MCI_SETPOSITIONADVISE message.  To
a streaming MCD, a position advise simply is a cuepoint which reoccurs every
x time units.  To enable position advise, the following<!-- entering slot 58 --> steps
should be followed: 1. Check flags and validate and pointers.
<BR>
2. If the caller has asked for position advise to be turned on then
<BR>
  a. If a stream has been created, then enable the recurring cuepoint
<BR>
   event.
<BR>
  b. Else, set a flag and enable the event later.
<BR>
3. If position advise is to be turned off, then disable the recurring
<BR>
  cuepoint event.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->Processes the MCI_PAUSE message.  On a MCI_PAUSE,

is not a required command, however, if a streaming MCD takes advantage of
temporary files, then it should use MCI_SAVE. 1. Ensure that the flags are
valid.
<BR>
2. Then ensure that all pointers point to valid memory.
<BR>
3. If any operations are currently active, they are then
