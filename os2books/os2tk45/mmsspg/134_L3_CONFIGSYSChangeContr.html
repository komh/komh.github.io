<H1>CONFIG.SYS Change Control Files</H1><!-- entering slot 172 -->
<P>
Some multimedia subsystems require unique statements in the CONFIG.SYS file.
 The CONFIG.SYS change control file creates, adds, merges, and replaces
CONFIG.SYS statements through the use of keywords.  The master control file,
CONTROL.SCR, specifies a SSCONFIGCH keyword for each file that contains
changes to the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
The following describes the keywords used in the CONFIG.SYS file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Keyword</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DEVICE
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Adds new device statements to the CONFIG.SYS file.
 The right side of the equal sign must be a quoted string.  For example:

<PRE>DEVICE="$(DEST)DEVICE.SYS /<I>parameters</I>"
</PRE>

<P>
A supported macro may be used.  Ordinarily, the $(DEST) macro is used. When
the $(DEST) macro is used, MINSTALL searches for the file named DEVICE.SYS
in the control files.  If MINSTALL finds it, the $(DEST) macro is replaced
with the full path of the destination of that file, and the final statement
is added to the CONFIG.SYS file.  For example:
<PRE>DEVICE=<I>d</I>:\SOMEDIR\DEVICE.SYS /<I>parameters</I>
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>MERGE<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Merges data into an
existing statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.  For example:
<PRE>MERGE "LIBPATH"=1
</PRE>

<P>
The number 1 relates to the CONTROL.SCR file destination subdirectory 1.
After MINSTALL finds subdirectory 1, it adds this path at the end of the
current LIBPATH statement. (A semicolon ends a line and is used between
components.)  If there is no current LIBPATH statement in the file, a LIBPATH
statement will be generated with the specified path.
<P>
If the right side of the equal sign is not a numeric string, the line is
copied as is.  For example:
<PRE>MERGE "SOMEVAR"="WHOKNOWS"
</PRE>

<P>
If the SOMEVAR environment variable exists, WHOKNOWS is added at the end
of the statement. If the variable does not exist, the statement:
<PRE>SOMEVAR=WHOKNOWS
</PRE>

<P>
is added to the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Refer to the TOOLKIT.CH file in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CF
subdirectory.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<P>
You also can insert SET following the first quotation mark character inside
the first quoted string.  The word SET is ignored unless you are adding
a new line to the CONFIG.SYS file.  In this case, SET is appended to the
beginning of the line.  For example:
<PRE>MERGE "SET SOMEVAR"="WHOKNOWS"
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>REPLACE<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Replaces an existing
CONFIG.SYS statement.
<P>
REPLACE can be followed by a variable name or a variable name preceded by
SET inside a quoted string.  On the right side of the equal sign is either
a number or a quoted string.  A supported macro may be used. For example:

<PRE>REPLACE "SET MMBASE" = 0
</PRE>

<P>
If the variable MMBASE is in the CONFIG.SYS file, then the value is changed
to 0.  If the variable does not exist, the following statement is added:

<PRE>SET MMBASE=C:\MMOS2;
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This statement replaces the existing statement.  Do not use
this statement in conjunction with a path statement.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
