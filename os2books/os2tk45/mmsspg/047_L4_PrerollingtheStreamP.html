<H1>Prerolling the Stream - Performance Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 54 -->
<P>
Prerolling a stream allows the source stream handlers to start and fill
the buffers.  An application can then start the streams for better real-time
response and initial synchronization of streams.  This is accomplished by
the SpiStartStream function with the SPI_START_PREROLL flag.
<P>
However, if a stream is already paused (STOP_PAUSED), the stream is already
cued so there is no need to call SpiStartStream to refill the buffers. The
following example illustrates how to check to see if a stream is in a paused
state.
<PRE>  /************************************
  * If the stream is paused, there is no
  * sense in cueing it since the buffers
  * are full anyway
  **************************************/

  if ( STRMSTATE == MCI_PAUSE  ||
       STRMSTATE == STOP_PAUSED )

      {
      /***********************************************
      ** If the stream is going the right way
      ** then we have the ability to avoid the cue
      ** since the buffers have been filled up before
      ** we did the pause
      **********************************************/

      if ( AMPMIX.ulOperation == OPERATION_RECORD &amp;&amp;
           fCueInput )
         {
         ulpInstance-&gt;ulCreateFlag = PREROLL_STATE;
         STRMSTATE = CUERECD_STATE;
         return ( MCIERR_SUCCESS );
         }

      /*************************************************
      * If the current stream is cued for playback and
      * we have a cue_output request, our work is done
      **************************************************/

      else if ( AMPMIX.ulOperation == OPERATION_PLAY &amp;&amp;
                fCueOutput )
         {

         ulpInstance-&gt;ulCreateFlag = PREROLL_STATE;
         STRMSTATE = CUEPLAY_STATE;
         return ( MCIERR_SUCCESS );
         }

      }   /* If the stream may be in cue state */
</PRE>
