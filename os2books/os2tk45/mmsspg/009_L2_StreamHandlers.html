<P>
The multimedia system provides stream handlers at both the system kernel
level (Ring 0) and the application level (Ring 3). Stream handlers are at
Ring 0 and Ring 3 because some streams are ideally controlled by a direct
connection between the stream handler and a device's physical device driver
(PDD).  Other streams are not associated with a data source or target, which
maps physically to a specific device.  For example, the file system stream
handler is a DLL, because all file system input/output (I/O) functions are
available as Ring 3 OS/2 functions, and service all file system devices.
 This eliminates the need to build a specific stream handler device driver
for every device the file system can access.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="009_L2_StreamHandlers_4.gif" WIDTH=647 HEIGHT=650>
<P>
Stream handlers are responsible for controlling the flow of application
data, in a continuous, real-time manner.  Each handler can establish multiple
data stream instances, where each stream involves data of a specific type;
for example, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) or ADPCM (Adaptive
Delta Pulse Code Modulation).  The application, through the use of a media
control driver, invokes an SPI function to create the stream and another
SPI function to activate the data stream.  The application does not have
to continuously invoke SPI functions to maintain data flow.  Instead, the
stream handler keeps the I/O continuous, simplifying the operations of the
application.
