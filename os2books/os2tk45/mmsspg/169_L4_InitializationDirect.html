<H1>Initialization Directives</H1><!-- entering slot 222 -->
<P>
Use initialization directives to set up the content of the script file.
 These directives must appear before execution directives because the tool
preprocesses the script file and builds process command buffers.
<P>
The @THREADS and @PROCESSES directives are mutually exclusive.  In other
words, the P2STRING tool supports either multithreaded or multiprocess execution
in a script file (not both).  In addition, there is a limit of 10 processes
or threads per script file. The following table lists the supported initialization
directives.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL><B> Description</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>@PROCESSES=<I>x</I></PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 38 -->
<UL>Specifies the number (<I>x</I>) of processes the
script file will be running.  For example:
<PRE>@PROCESSES=2</PRE>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>@THREADS=<I>x</I></PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 38 -->
<UL>Specifies the number (<I>x</I>) of threads the
script file will be running.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>@EVENTS={<I>n</I>[=0|1] [,<I>n</I>[=0|1]]}
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x12 38 -->
<UL>Specifies one or more<I> n</I>ames of events. Events
are user-defined with a maximum of 15 characters. Events can be set to 1
or 0. Set an event to 1 for an event that is set with the @SET_EVENT execution
directive. Set an event to 0 to clear or reset the event. If no initialization
values are specified, the event is initialized to 0. For example:
<PRE>@EVENTS={brad=1,john=1,test=0}</PRE>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
