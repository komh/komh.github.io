<P>
Cuepoints remain active for the life of the stream-meaning that once enabled,
they remain for the duration of the stream, whether the user decides to
seek forwards or backwards. If the user seeks over an event, the stream
handler should not detect that event.  If the user seeks backwards, the
stream handler should re-enable that event.
