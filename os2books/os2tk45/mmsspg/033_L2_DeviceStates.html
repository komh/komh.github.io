<H1>Device States</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
Media devices that transport data are considered to be in one of the following
nine states at any given time:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Playing<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Recording<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Seeking<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Stopped<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Paused during a playback operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Paused during a recording operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Cued for a playback operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Cued for a recording operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Closed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When a device is opened, the device context is assumed to be in the<I> stopped
</I>state.  The<I> closed</I> state can be viewed as both the initial state
and the termination state.  Or this state can be thought of as not a state
at all, because a device context does not exist before it is opened, and
ceases to exist when it is closed.
<P>
The following figure lists the allowable device states in the first column
of the table and indicates the changes in state that occur when the command
messages shown at the top of the table are issued. This table assumes all
error conditions keep the device in its current state. For example, a waveform
player that is opened without an element remains in the stopped state when
a play is issued, and the MCD receives an error code.
<P>
Note that a device is in the<I> seek</I> state only during the SEEK operation.
Upon completion of the seek, the device enters the<I> stop</I> state. The
following figure is provided as a guide to application developers and MCD
writers.  There can be no guarantee that every media device will conform
to this table, but every effort should be made to hide the complexity of
the device from the application.
