<H1>Limitations of MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE Verification</H1><!-- entering slot 231 -->
<P>
There are limitation to what you can verify in the P2STRING tool using event
notification lines.  The MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE line requires the use of the
"return<I> value</I>" item in the respective string commands.  This line
also does not provide for timing start point; for example, playing has started.
 The P2STRING tool can only count the number of messages received for a
specific user parameter (used as a key) and check if subsequent messages
have positions approximate to the given expected position interval.  The
script writer must determine how many SETPOSITIONADVISE messages are expected,
considering the duration of playing, time format, and start position of
the play/record.  The reference<I> position</I> given in the expected notification
line must be in MMTIME units.  If the "expected number of messages" parameter
is omitted, the tool only verifies the position interval (not the number).
 In case of scripts where play, seek, or record are used to cover non-monotonic
ranges, P2STRING might report failures on position-advises because it expects
each SETPOSITIONADVISE to be in the next position interval from the previous
message.  If the script makes a jump to a position that does not conform
to this, the status will be logged as failed.
<P>
For example:
<PRE>setpositionadvise SomeDevice every 10000 on return 5
+MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE 10000 %5
play SomeDevice from 35000 to 55000 notify (produce 3 positionchange msgs)
seek SomeDevice to 30000 wait
play SomeDevice notify (produces a number of messages starting at 30000)
</PRE>

<P>
MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE messages are logged as failed, because of the lapse
in position interval.  A way to handle this situation is to disable the
MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE before an explicit position jump is made and enable
the same SETPOSITIONADVISE with a different user parameter.
<P>
For example:
<PRE>setpositionadvise SomeDevice every 10000 on return 5
+MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE 10000 %5
play SomeDevice from 35000 to 55000 notify (produce 3 positionchange msgs)
setpositionadvise SomeDevice every 10000 off
seek SomeDevice to 30000 wait
setpositionadvise SomeDevice every 10000 on return 6
+MM_MCIPOSITIONCHANGE 10000 %6
play SomeDevice notify (produce a number of messages starting at 30000)
</PRE>
