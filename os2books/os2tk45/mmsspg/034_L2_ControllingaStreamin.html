<H1>Controlling a Streaming Device: Waveform Audio MCD</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
To play back a waveform file stored on a user's hard disk, the Duet Player
I sample program sends command messages to the Media Device Manager (MDM)
by means of the mciSendCommand function.  The application is shielded from
having to know specific information about the hardware.  In other words,
the application does not need to know which audio adapter is being used
to play back the waveform file.  The MDM sends the commands to a generic
mciDriverEntry interface for audio devices, located in the AUDIOMCD DLL.
 The device-independent AUDIOMCD and its device-specific counterpart AUDIOIF
are two of the modules that comprise the waveform audio MCD as shown in
the following figure. Also depicted are the MMIO and SSM interfaces used
by the MCD.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="034_L2_ControllingaStreamin_8.gif" WIDTH=588 HEIGHT=504>
