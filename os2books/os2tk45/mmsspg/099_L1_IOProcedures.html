<P>
This section illustrates how to write a custom file format I/O procedure
(IOProc).  Source code is provided for the following I/O procedures located
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM subdirectory:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Case-Converter<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Provides a simple example of how
to write a file format I/O procedure (without illustrating the use of data
translation).  This sample performs case conversion of text. See the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\CASECONV
subdirectory.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> M-Motion<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Provides
an example of how to write an I/O procedure for use with image file formats.
 This sample enables file format transparency for M-Motion still video files
and illustrates the use of data translation. See the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\MMIOPROC
subdirectory.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Ultimotion*<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> Provides
a detailed example of what you need to consider when writing I/O procedures
for software motion video file formats.  ULIOT includes CODEC support and
illustrates how to integrate common and file-format-specific code to support
multiple I/O procedures. See the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\ULTIMOIO subdirectory.

<P>
The following discussion focuses on the messages the M-Motion I/O procedure
samples support, and what minimal processing is required for the messages.
 Information is also provided on the Ultimotion I/O procedure, which illustrates
how to call and initialize a CODEC procedure.
