<H1>Installation LOG File</H1><!-- entering slot 190 -->
<P>
During installation, MINSTALL writes an installation log file called MINSTALL.LOG.
 The LOG file records installation information and can be used to identify
problems that occur during the installation procedure.
<P>
When you start the installation procedure, the LOG file defaults to the
root directory of the startup (boot) disk.  When the user selects the<B> Install
</B>push button in the installation main selection window, the LOG file
is moved to the destination directory.  The LOG file can be printed using
the PRINT command or viewed using the TYPE command.  To view the LOG file
on the screen, at an OS/2 command prompt, type:
<PRE>TYPE <I>d</I>:\MMOS2\INSTALL\MINSTALL.LOG
</PRE>

<P>
where<I> d</I> is the destination drive selected for the installation.
<P>
If a problem occurs during installation, MINSTALL might display a screen
with information about the problem.  If you cannot solve the problem using
the information on the screen, you can view the LOG file to determine how
to handle the problem.  The problem will not necessarily be the last entry
in the LOG file.
<P>
If you determine that you need to call IBM for support, print the LOG file
before you call.  The IBM support personnel will need the LOG information
to resolve your installation problem.
<P>
If the installation is successful, a Congratulations screen appears.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> You might receive a message that the installation was successful,
but when you view the LOG file you notice that the file reported some errors.
 This means that the errors were resolved during the installation procedure
and the errors reported in the LOG file can be ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
