<P>
Device driver stream handlers communicate with the hardware PDD through
the DDCMDEntryPoint. This is accomplished through the use of device driver
commands (DDCMDs), which allow a stream handler to request a PDD to perform
functions such as starting, stopping, or resuming a device. This interface
uses the IDC mechanism provided by the ATTACHDD DevHelp function. The stream
handler must attach to the device driver to receive the DDCMD entry point
address of the device driver. This function is performed before issuing
device driver commands.
