<P>
All lines that do not fall into any of the other categories are interpreted
as OS/2 multimedia string commands.  These lines are passed to the Media
Device Manager (MDM) through the mciSendString function after the environment
variables have been substituted.
<P>
Any token in the string command line bracketed by question marks (such as
?FOO?) is interpreted as an environment variable.  The actual value of the
environment variable is substituted into the string before it is passed
to the mciSendString function.  If the variable is not found, a warning
is issued and the token is replaced with a NULL string.  For example, assuming
the environment string MMDATA is set to D:\DATA,<B> open ?mmdata?\temp.wav
alias a</B> is equal to<B> open d:\data\temp.wav alias a</B>.
