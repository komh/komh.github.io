<P>
The P2STRING tool processes script files (containing string commands and
tool directives) to test the behavior of subsystems in OS/2 multimedia.
 P2STRING extracts the strings from the script files and processes the commands
through the mciSendString function.  Messages and error conditions of the
processes included in the scripts are logged to an output file and displayed
in windows (as shown in the following figure). Each process logs to its
own display window, but all processes log to the same output file.  In addition,
if you close the display window, the string execution thread is immediately
destroyed and the entire process ends.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="163_L1_P2STRINGTool_20.gif" WIDTH=796 HEIGHT=512>
<P>
Output messages include all non-comment lines read from the script (for
example, script directives, command strings, expected return values, expected
and received notify messages, and status lines). In addition, errors and
debugging statements of unsuccessful string commands are logged to a file
named P2STRING.LOG file.
