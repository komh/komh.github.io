<H1>Installing a Stream Handler</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->
<P>
When a stream handler is installed by MINSTALL, the following events occur:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A media driver issues an SpiGetHandler function.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the handler is loaded, the Sync/Stream Manager
(SSM) reads in the respective stream protocol control blocks (SPCBs) from
the SPI.INI file.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the stream handler is a DLL, the SSM loads
and registers the DLL with the DOSLoadModule function. However, if the stream
handler is a device driver, the SSM does not issue a DOSLoadModule because
a CONFIG.SYS statement installs the device drivers during system startup.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Before the SSM can read in the respective SPCBs, the SPCBs first must be
installed in the SPI.INI file, which is built during the multimedia installation
of the base OS/2 product.  This file contains all the information about
stream handlers and stream classes that are currently supported by OS/2
multimedia.
