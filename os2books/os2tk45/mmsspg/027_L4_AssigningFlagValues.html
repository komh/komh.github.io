<H1>Assigning Flag Values</H1><!-- entering slot 28 -->
<P>
In addition to indicating the fields used in a data structure, flags can
indicate an option that does not use any parameters.  For example, the MCI_WAIT
flag does not use any parameters.
<P>
When you add new flags, you must make sure that they do not conflict with
the flags already in use.  Bits 0 through 15 of the 32-bit ULONG are reserved
for MDM.  Bit 16 (0x00010000) is the first fit that a driver can use for
its flags.  If your command message is a new command message, you must choose
bit positions that do not conflict with the flags already defined for that
command.  Any unused bits in the new flag must be set to zero.  For example,
if a new command for videodisc players uses flags 16 through 20, a custom
extension to the new command could use flags 21 through 31.
<P>
To continue the example for adding a RESET command to a videodisc driver,
the code sample shown in the following example defines a data structure,
a corresponding pointer for it, and the flag corresponding to the program
field of the data structure.
<PRE>typedef struct {
  HWND   hwndCallback;
  ULONG  ulProgram;
} MCI_VD_RESET_PARMS;

typedef MCI_VD_RESET_PARMS FAR * PMCI_VD_RESET_PARMS;

#define MCI_VD_RESET_PROGRAM     0x00010000L
</PRE>

<P>
When the application sets the MCI_VD_RESET_PROGRAM flag in<I> ulParam1</I>,
it indicates that a value is assigned in the<I> ulProgram</I> field.
<P>
Now that you have created the message command, data structure, and flags,
you need to create the command table that tells MDM how to translate the
equivalent string command into the message command format.  See <A HREF="031_L3_ParsingaCommandList.html">Parsing
a Command List</A>.
