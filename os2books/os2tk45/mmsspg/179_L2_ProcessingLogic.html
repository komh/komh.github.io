<P>
A string command line can be followed by zero to one return value lines,
or zero to three notification lines.  Note that this is an exclusive OR,
meaning that specifying both expected return value and expected notification
is not going to give reliable results due to the fact that the returned
buffer does not become valid prior to the end of the notify message.  Also,
in case of notify flags, return values are in the procedural interface format
rather than in the string interface format.
<P>
The MDM will not be able to convert return values to strings for commands
processed with the notify flag because media control drivers will be sending
their notify messages directly to the application.
<P>
Status of each command is determined in two stages.  The first stage is
at string execution.  If the mciSendString function returns an error and
there was no =!ERROR reference line in the script following the command
string line, the command is considered failed.  If a return value was found
after mciSendString is processed, the tool will check for expected return
and perform comparison of the two.  It they do not match, the command is
considered failed.  In case of an error that is not in the range understood
by the mciGetErrorString function, the command is considered failed even
if the !ERROR was encountered.
<P>
The second stage of the comparison is after a notification is received and
after all the commands are issued.  If a notification was received and it
successfully compared to the expected notification line, the command is
considered successful.  If there was no reference notification line, status
of the command will not be assigned, unless notify-error was returned.  After
all the scripts are processed, expected reference notifications will be
used to determine if all the notifications were received.  The commands
that did not receive a notify, and had an expected notification line of
the type, are marked failed.  Note that command strings are not examined
for presence of a notify flag and it is the writer's responsibility to create
an expected notify line if it is of importance.  In case of expected NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL
messages, all codes other than NOTIFY_ERROR are considered valid.  This
includes NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL, NOTIFY_ABORTED and NOTIFY_SUPERCEDED.  If any
other notify code was specified as expected, and exact match will be checked
for.  If NOTIFY_ERROR is expected, all errors in the range are verified
as passed.  There is no facility for verification of an exact error code
returned in the notification.
