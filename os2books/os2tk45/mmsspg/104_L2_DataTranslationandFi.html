<H1>Data Translation and File Conversion</H1><!-- entering slot 127 -->
<P>
MMIO provides a set of options in its API to support two modes of file access-<I>translated
</I>and<I> untranslated</I>.  These modes enable an application to access
data in its pure, proprietary format, or in a standard presentation format
when performing its I/O operations.  An IOProc can be written to optionally
support both access methods.
<P>
The default mode of access,<I> untranslated</I>, allows the caller to perform
I/O of file data in its native format.  All header information and any data
is written to a file or read from a file and presented at the caller level
without modification.
<P>
The optional mode of access,<I> translated</I>, is the method used to mask
proprietary data formats and allow a caller to use standardized header and
data formats for a specific media type (for example, audio, image, or MIDI).
 A set of standard header formats and accompanying data formats have been
defined as the standard presentation format for these purposes.  An IOProc
can be written to optionally support the standard format.  It performs the
translation of header information, data information, or both from its native
format to the standard format for that media type during read and write
type operations.  The translation is performed for the file header and data.

<P>
With full translation capability enabled in pairs of IOProcs, it is possible
to convert files from one format to another very easily. File conversion
is simply a combination of loading from one file and saving to another.
For example, an application can read from an AVC image file with translation
enabled, to the standard presentation format, which is the OS/2 bitmap.
The application can then use the bitmap as desired, including displaying
it on the screen, image manipulating, and printing. Alternatively, the bitmap
could be saved in a different file format such as M-Motion, by writing to
the M-Motion IOProc with translation enabled. For example:<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="104_L2_DataTranslationandFi_18.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200>
<P>
I/O procedures and applications must use the same standard presentation
format of data defined for each media type for conversion to be enabled.
 (The media types defined are image, audio, MIDI, digital video, and movie.)
 These standard formats apply to media descriptive (header) information
and media content.  The standard<I> description structures</I> are supersets
of the headers each file format normally uses.  This permits all formats
to place the subset of their information into the standard form for other
applications to access.  Similarly, each specific format can retrieve only
the subset that is necessary for its purpose.  The standard<I> content format
</I>is a usable data format representation that maintains as much quality
as possible.
<P>
Translation functions assist these standard forms in helping to ensure that
data is portable between applications, IOProcs, and the operating system
services.  The structures containing descriptive information have fields
that can be mapped to system structures, such as the OS/2 operating system's
BITMAPINFOHEADER.  The content format must be directly usable by the operating
system and services, or by standard hardware devices.
<P>
The descriptive header and content formats are tightly coupled.  If a file
contains a media item, an application can query the header describing the
media.  The IOProc returns the header, which includes the supported content
format most closely matching the information actually in the file.  For
example, if an image file contains 21-bit YUV data, the IOProc for that
file informs the application that it is providing 24-bit RGB.  The IOProc
is responsible for translating all subsequent read operations from YUV to
RGB.  In addition, when an application is creating a new media element,
it can set the header for a new media item.  All subsequent translated write
operations, which are sent from the application to the IOProc, must contain
data in the content format described by the header.
<P>
Each data type uses different description structures and content formats.
The following table gives an overview of the standard presentation formats
for supported media types.
