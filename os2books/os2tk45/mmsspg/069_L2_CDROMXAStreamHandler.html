<H1>CD-ROM XA Stream Handler</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
The Sync/Stream Manager provides a mechanism to allow one data stream source
and multiple targets, called<I> split streams</I>. For example, CD-ROM XA
can interleave waveform audio, video, and text data within the same data
buffer. The CD-ROM XA Stream Handler splits the data into multiple streams
for CD-ROM XA devices. It is more efficient for the stream handler to read
the combined data into one buffer and then insert the video data into a
video stream and the waveform audio data into a waveform audio stream without
copying the data. The waveform audio data stream is then consumed by a waveform
audio stream handler and the video stream by a video stream handler. The
waveform audio stream handler sees only the audio portions of the data stream
and the video stream handler sees only the video portions of the stream.

<P>
A data stream can be split into multiple split streams. The number is limited
only by the resources of the system. Each separate split of the stream is
a separate stream. The work of parsing and determining the different data
is the job of the source stream handler, which actually fills an empty buffer
from the Sync/Stream Manager with data from the source device.
<P>
The source stream handler must determine which data goes in which stream.
It must then return to the Sync/Stream Manager pointers to the individual
records of the buffer. Each record is a portion of the buffer filled with
data specific to one of the split streams. These records are returned to
the Sync/Stream Manager indicating which stream they should go to. The Sync/Stream
Manager will then queue these records in the respective buffer or record
queue for one of the split streams sharing the buffer.
<P>
You can set up this type of split stream as follows. Multiple streams must
be created, each with a call to the<I> SpiCreateStream</I> function to the
Sync/Stream Manager. The first of these functions is a normal stream creation
call with the<I> hstreamBuf</I> parameter set to NULL. Every other subsequent
<I>SpiCreateStream</I> call that needs to share the buffers of the first
stream must pass that stream's handle in the<I> hstreamBuf</I> parameter.
This is the mechanism used by the Sync/Stream Manager to allow these split
streams to share the buffers of the first stream.
<P>
The source stream handler will also receive this parameter on an<I> SHC_CREATE
</I>call and need to support this kind of streaming. The SPCBBUF_INTERLEAVED
flag in the SPCB that is set by the source stream handler to indicate whether
it can do split streaming. If it cannot, any<I> SpiCreateStream</I> attempting
to use its buffers will be rejected.  Any stream sharing buffers will be
negotiated to use the same size buffers and number of buffers as the stream
that allocated the buffers.
<P>
The split-stream mechanism only works for one source and multiple targets.
