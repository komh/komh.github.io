<H1>Expected Return Strings</H1><!-- entering slot 225 -->
<P>
Many OS/2 multimedia commands return strings.  It is possible to check these
strings against an expected value with an expected return string line.
<P>
An expected return string line has the format:
<PRE>=result
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> equal sign</I> (=) must be in column 1 and should have no trailing
spaces.  If an empty string is expected, nothing should follow the = (not
even spaces).  For example:
<PRE>status cdaudio ready wait
=TRUE
status cdaudio mode wait
=stopped
</PRE>

<P>
The expected result is always interpreted as a string.  This might produce
some unusual outputs for commands that return binary data.
<P>
Where the return is a textual numerical value, it may be matched to a tolerance
range of Â±10% using a<I> tilde</I> (~) before the number.  This is typically
used when the exact value cannot be known.  For example:
<PRE>set foo time format milliseconds wait
play foo notify
@PAUSE 1000
stop foo wait
status foo position wait
=~1000
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, the status command is considered successful if the returned string
is in the range 900 - 1100.
