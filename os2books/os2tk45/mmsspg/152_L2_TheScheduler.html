<H1>The Scheduler</H1><!-- entering slot 194 -->
<P>
The scheduler is the mechanism that passes messages from one instance to
another. It allows multiple instances to pass messages "simultaneously"
to multiple targets. The scheduler uses two round-robin queues, Q1 and Q2.
Q1 is for real-time messages, and Q2 for non-real-time System Exclusive
(SysEx) messages. The scheduler uses the following algorithm:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Some instance creates a message. This can occur
during interrupt time (for example, from a hardware node) or via task time
(for example, from an application node).  It adds that message to the end
of either Q1 or Q2. It then instructs the scheduler to process the queues.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The scheduler runs. If an interrupt from a Type
A driver occurs, it is possible for a hardware node to create a new message
while the scheduler is running. (See the<I> MMPM/2 Device Driver Reference
</I>for a description of a Type A driver.) The scheduler can accept new
entries into either queue while it is running. It will disable interrupts
only during those times when the queue is manipulated.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The scheduler first processes all entries in
Q1.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When Q1 is empty, the scheduler looks at Q2.
If it is empty, the scheduler exits. Otherwise, it processes only one element
in Q2. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In this manner, real-time messages in Q1 are given priority over messages
in Q2. Source nodes should put non-real-time SysEx messages into Q2, and
all other messages in Q1. This prevents bulk SysEx dumps from blocking the
real-time messages.
<P>
The scheduler has the ability to use a<I> scheduler daemon</I> to run. After
a source instance places a message on a scheduler queue, it tells the scheduler
to run. However, this might occur at interrupt time if the message is from
a hardware node. If the scheduler were to run at interrupt time as well,
system performance could be significantly reduced.
<P>
The desired effect would be to run the scheduler in task time, after the
interrupt handler has exited. This is known as<I> deferred interrupt processing
</I>and the scheduler daemon provides this. The daemon is a small program
which effectively creates a ring 0 super high priority thread. These threads
are guaranteed to run immediately after the current thread or context has
completed. In other words, if an interrupt handler unblocks such a thread,
that thread is run immediately after the interrupt handler exits. If it
is unblocked by a ring 3 process, then it preempts the process that unblocked
and runs immediately. If it is unblocked by another ring 0 task thread,
it runs after that thread has returned to ring 3 (for example, after the
strategy call).
<P>
When the scheduler is asked to process the queues, it checks to see whether
it is running in another thread.  If not, then it processes the queues immediately.
Otherwise, it checks to see if the scheduler daemon is available. If so,
then it unblocks the daemon thread, which will eventually run the scheduler.
If there is no daemon, then it has no choice but to process the queues immediately.
If the node network is complex, then the scheduler could spend a significant
amount of time in the interrupt handler.
