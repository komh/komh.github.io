<P>
The Media Device Interface is a set of defined and extendable media control
commands.  How the MCD communicates with the appropriate hardware device
drivers to perform the requested command message is completely up to the
MCD.  Device commands used by MCDs are grouped into required, basic, and
system command messages.
