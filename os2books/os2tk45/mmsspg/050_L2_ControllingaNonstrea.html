<H1>Controlling a Nonstreaming Device: CD Audio MCD</H1><!-- entering slot 60 -->
<P>
The CD audio MCD controls a nonstreaming device: the CD-ROM drive.  Because
it is a nonstreaming device, the CD-ROM drive does not require buffered
I/O for streaming by the sync/stream manager.  Instead, it plays audio out
through its internal Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), which is the nonstreaming
device equivalent of an audio adapter. Thus, the CD audio MCD must use the
IOCtl interface to process its own commands to manipulate the data stream
within the device.
<P>
The modules of the CD audio MCD are shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="050_L2_ControllingaNonstrea_10.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=480>
