<H1>DLL Model: File System Stream Handler</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
The multimedia system provides stream handlers at both system kernel level
(Ring 0) as OS/2 PDDs, and at application level (Ring 3) as OS/2 DLLs. The
reason for having both types of stream handlers is that while some streams
are ideally controlled by a direct connection between the stream handler
and a device's PDD, other streams are not associated with a data source
or target, which maps physically to a specific device. For example, the
File System Stream Handler is a DLL, because all file system I/O functions
are available as Ring 3 OS/2 API, and service all file system devices. This
eliminates the need to build a specific stream handler PDD for every device
the file system can access.
