<P>
The media control interface provides the primary mechanism for application
control of media devices.  The top layer consists of the Media Device Manager
(MDM), which provides resource management for media devices.  The bottom
layer consists of<I> media control drivers (MCDs)</I>-dynamic link libraries
that implement the function of a media device.
<P>
Applications interact with the media control interface (and thus with media
devices) in two ways, through either a procedural interface (mciSendCommand)
or a string interface (mciSendString).  However, before an MCD can interpret
a string command, the MDM must use a command table to change the string
into an equivalent procedural command.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="007_L2_MediaControlDrivers_2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=480>
<P>
MCDs do not directly control hardware devices.  Instead, they pass commands
through a subsystem or physical device driver interface.  This arrangement
frees MCDs from having to be knowledgeable about the hardware in order to
implement its function.  However, MCDs have to be knowledgeable about the
<I>means</I> of implementing that function.  For example, a CD-Audio player
that is implemented using a CD-ROM drive with a built-in Digital-to-Analog
Converter (DAC) can perform its function by simply issuing device IOCtl
commands to the drive's device driver.  However, a CD-Audio player that
uses a separate Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for playback of the digital
audio data is implemented quite differently, calling functions to manage
a DSP coprocessor and data transfer between the drive and the coprocessor.

<P>
MCDs can also use the services of the other OS/2 multimedia subsystems such
as the Stream Programming Interface (SPI).  This subsystem provides data
streaming services that allow stream-handlers to control the flow of data
from one device to another in real time, maintaining a continuous flow of
data between physical devices.
