The following sections examine the Ultimotion IOProc (ULIOT) sample (located
in the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\MM\ULTIMOIO subdirectory), which includes source
code to compress or decompress a data object.  The ULIOT I/O procedure calls
the Ultimotion CODEC procedure to compress raw digital images into a smaller
form so they can use less storage space.  To play motion video, the ULIOT
sample can also call the decompressor part of the CODEC procedure to reconstruct
the original image from the compressed data.
