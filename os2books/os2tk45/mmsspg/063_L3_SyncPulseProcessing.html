<H1>Sync Pulse Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 78 -->
<P>
Each stream handler (DLL or device driver) can provide sync pulse handling
to support synchronization for any streams activated. Typically, the stream
handler sync pulse handling logic is capable of correcting the active stream's
progress in its real-time context, based on information received in sync
pulse SYNC_EVCB created by the stream handler and accessed by the Sync/Stream
Manager.
<P>
For example, if the slave's current local time is 45000 (15.0 seconds in
MMTIME), and the master sync pulse time is 44500 (14.83 sec), then the slave
stream handler's sync pulse logic should adjust the pace of data streaming
(slow down, or repeat the last 170 milliseconds worth of data). This time-adjusting
(resync) logic is unique to the type of data the handler is streaming.
<P>
Since there can be occurrences of heavy system load that make it impossible
for DLL sync pulse logic to get control between two sync pulses (task dispatch
latency can rise occasionally to delay even time-critical threads), the
handler always takes the most current master time (last sync pulse posted).
The SSM sets a sync pulse<I> overrun flag</I> if a sync pulse is not processed
before the next sync pulse arrives. Also, the sync pulse logic and all associated
control data objects must reside in fixed memory, so that these code and
data pages are never paged out (at least not while the stream is active).

<P>
The sync pulse logic must be high performance by nature. Complex, time-consuming
synchronization adjusting routines with very long path lengths will not
be able to maintain synchronization if they are dispatched continuously.
The sync pulse logic is a second level interrupt handler, so its performance
must be optimized. If no adjustment of the stream is necessary, the routine
might not need to be dispatched at all, which brings us to one final point.

<P>
The Sync/Stream Manager has sync pulse distribution logic that controls
when it will set the slave device driver handler's sync pulse SYNCPOLLING
bit flag (the SSM does not call the handler's IDC interface). This logic
similarly controls when it will dispatch the DLL handler's time-critical
thread (clear a semaphore the thread is waiting on). Typically, the DLL
handler detects that a sync pulse has occurred by polling the SYNCPOLLING
bit flag in its sync pulse SYNC_EVCB that it gave to the Sync/Stream Manager
on return from an SHC_ENABLE_SYNC message. This SYNCPOLLING bit flag is
set only when the difference between the master stream time and the slave's
local time (both stored in the sync pulse SYNC_EVCB) exceeds a specified
<I>resync tolerance value</I>. The Sync/Stream Manager determines this difference
for all slaves on each sync pulse received from the master, and only notifies
the slaves whose stream has deviated too much from the master stream time.
Each stream handler that can receive sync pulses must provide its tolerance
value (a minimum time difference expressed in MMTIME) in the stream's SPCB
passed on return from the SHC_CREATE.
