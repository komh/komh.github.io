<H1>Media Control Driver Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
The objects that receive the device control commands issued by multimedia
applications using mciSendCommand or mciSendString are called media control
drivers.  Media control drivers are OS/2 dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that
provide a level of hardware independence for applications.  The Media Device
Manager (MDM) provides the interface to these media objects.  The MDM also
provides a level of component management, making it possible for an application
to synchronize its use of MCDs as well as share MCDs with other applications.

<P>
The following figure illustrates the MCDs provided with the OS/2 multimedia
system.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="011_L2_MediaControlDriverAr_5.gif" WIDTH=710 HEIGHT=632>
