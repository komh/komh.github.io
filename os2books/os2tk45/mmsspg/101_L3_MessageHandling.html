<H1>Message Handling</H1><!-- entering slot 123 -->
<P>
An IOProc is a message-based handler.  Applications and the MMIO subsystem
communicate to IOProcs through the use of MMIO messages.  When MMIO receives
a request from an application, the MMIO Manager sends a message for that
operation to the IOProc that is responsible for that particular file format
or storage system.  In turn, the I/O procedure performs operations based
on the messages it receives from the MMIO Manager or an application.
<P>
MMIO messages can be either pre-defined or user-defined messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Pre-defined Message<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This is a system message that
is sent by the MMIO Manager for its associated function.  For example, an
application issuing an mmioOpen function causes the MMIO Manager to send
an MMIOM_OPEN message to an I/O procedure to open a specific file.  These
messages enable applications to manage media files in a format-independent
manner.  The MMIO Manager determines the correct I/O procedure to process
the message, based on an I/O procedure identifier and I/O procedure type
specified in the function.  See <A HREF="102_L3_IOProcedureIdentifie.html">I/O
Procedure Identifier (FOURCC)</A> and <A HREF="103_L3_IOProcedureType.html">I/O
Procedure Type</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> User-defined Message<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This
is a private message sent directly to an I/O procedure from an application
through the use of the mmioSendMessage function.  This function enables
a program to call an I/O procedure directly (unlike system messages, which
are sent by the MMIO Manager).  MMIOOS2.H in the \TOOLKIT\H subdirectory
defines the identifier MMIO_USER so that you can create your own messages.
 The mmioSendMessage function requires that your custom messages be defined
at or above the MMIOM_USER value defined in the MMIOOS2.H file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
