<P>
Suppose you want to define a new reset command for an MCD supporting a videodisc
player.  You can call this command by sending a<B> reset</B><B><I> program_number
</B></I>string.  The command sets all player parameters to their default
settings or one of several predefined states indicated by the<I> program_number</I>.

<P>
You would add the following message to the list of messages you must support
in mciDriverEntry:
<PRE>#define MCI_VD_RESET MCI_USER_MESSAGES
</PRE>

<P>
MCI_USER_MESSAGES is the first integer you can use for custom messages.
 Since the resource compiler does not accept mathematical expressions in
the RCDATA resource type, you must indicate the specific value you want
to use.
<P>
Now that you have defined the message ID, you must define the data structure
and the command table, and create the code to handle this message in mciDriverEntry.
