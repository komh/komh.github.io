<H1>Communication to the Stream Handler</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->
<P>
The SHDEntryPoint contains the following two messages. These messages are
located in the SHDD.H file of the \TOOLKIT\H subdirectory. SHDD.H contains
the data structures, their type definitions, and #define statements for
certain values. Note that the messages pass pointers to packets of data,
to allow maximum flexibility for the future.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
SHD_REPORT_INT<!-- lm: 0x11 5 -->
<UL> The PDD uses this message when it
needs things at interrupt time. For example, it uses this message to tell
the stream handler it has used up all the data and needs some more.
<P>
When the stream handler gets the call, it knows the PDD is passing back
a buffer that it might already have consumed. So the stream handler returns
on that call, giving the PDD a fresh buffer to consume.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> SHD_REPORT_EVENT
<!-- lm: 0x11 5 -->
<UL>The stream handler uses this message to keep in
sync with what the PDD is doing. For example, the stream handler can request
the PDD to report back every tenth of a second that data is played. And
the stream handler has all the logic to handle these events. The PDD examines
the request, and during its checks when it realizes a tenth of a second
has been played in data, the PDD calls SHD_REPORT_EVENT. The stream handler
can do what it wants at this point, and the PDD returns.
<P>
The PDD is the only one that really knows what is going on. In other words,
only the PDD knows how much data, to the millisecond, has been played out
to the device. The stream handler can approximate the data played, using
calculations based on how much data has gone by. But the stream handler
cannot calculate the data played to the millisecond, or even to the fraction
of a millisecond, the way the PDD can.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
