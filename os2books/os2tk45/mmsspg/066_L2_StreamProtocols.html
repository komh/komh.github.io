<H1>Stream Protocols</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
The Stream Protocol Control Block (SPCB) defines key parameters that control
the behavior of a data stream. The application can query, install, or deinstall
a specific SPCB from a stream handler. SPCB information is installed in
the SPI.INI file by means of a resource file. (See <A HREF="141_L2_InstallingaStreamHan.html">Installing
a Stream Handler</A> for a description of how to install stream protocol.)

<P>
Each stream handler supports one or more stream protocols. Each SPCB is
uniquely identified by the value of the stream data type (SPCB key). One
field in the SPCB key allows the stream handler to have multiple SPCBs installed
for the same data type. This field can be used by an application to specify
which SPCB, for any data type, it wants to use. Each application in the
system could define multiple SPCBs for the same data type (see the<I> ulType
</I>field in the SPCBKEY data structure). The application can modify a stream
protocol by installing a new SPCB and deinstalling the old SPCB.
<P>
The parameters in the SPCB are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

expansion of the SPCB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

between multiple SPCB's of the same data stream type.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->

waveform or MIDI).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->

16-bit stereo PCM).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->

</UL> Data
Flag<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Attributes of the data type. (that is, specifies
whether data or time cuepoints are supported by this data type).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBDATA_CUETIME - This data type can support time
cuepoint events.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBDATA_CUEDATA - This data type can support data
cuepoint events.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBDATA_NOSEEK - Seeking cannot be done on this
data type.<!-- lm: 0x2 26 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Number of Records
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Maximum number of records per buffer. (This is only
valid for split streams).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Data Block Size<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Size
of a block. A block is an atomic piece of data. For example, for digital
audio data type PCM 16-bit stereo at a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, the block
size would be 4 bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Data Buffer Size<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Size
of buffer to be used while streaming. Maximum buffer size is 64KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Min
Number of Buffers<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Minimum number of buffers needed
to maintain a constant data stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Max Number of
Buffers<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Maximum number of buffers needed (ideal
number). For normal streams, this means the number of buffers that will
be allocated for the stream. For user provided buffer streaming, this means
the number of buffers that the Sync/Stream Manager can queue up for a consumer.
This can be used by a source stream handler that gives the same set of buffers
to the Sync/Stream Manager repeatedly. If the number of buffers is set to
the number of buffers in the set minus one, the source stream handler will
be able to detect when the target has consumed a buffer and it can be reused.
Assuming that the set of buffers is an ordered set and each buffer is used
in the same order each time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Source Start Number
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Number of EMPTY buffers required to start the source
stream handler. The value should be at least as big as the maximum number
of buffers that would be requested by the source stream handler.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Target
Start Number<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Number of FULL buffers required to
start the target stream handler. The value should be at least as big as
the maximum number of buffers that would be requested by the target stream
handler. Usually, a target will require at least two buffers at the start
of the stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Buffer Flag<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Buffer
attributes (that is, the user provides buffers, fixed block size, interleaved
data type, and maximum buffer size).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_USERPROVIDED - User provides buffers for
streaming. The Sync/Stream Manager will not allocate buffers, but attempt
to lock down user provided buffers or copy the data to locked buffers. Using
this flag will affect the performance of streaming. Only a source stream
handler can set this flag. This flag is mutually exclusive with the SPCBBUF_<!-- entering slot 83 -->INTERLEAVEDflag
.TheSPCBBUF _ FIXEDBUFcannotbeusedwiththisflagset .<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_FIXEDBUF - The buffer size for this stream
handler must be a particular fixed size (for this data type). This flag
cannot be used with the SPCBBUF_USERPROVIDED flag. The SPCBBUF_INTERLEAVED
flag (split stream) implies SPCBBUF_FIXEDBUF.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_NONCONTIGUOUS - Each data buffer is allocated
contiguously in physical memory unless both stream handlers set the non-contiguous
flag (SPCBBUF_NONCONTIGUOUS). This flag allows the system flexibility in
allocating memory. A device driver stream handler may require contiguous
memory, while a DLL stream handler may not.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_INTERLEAVED - This stream is a split stream.
It consists of one input stream of interleaved data that is split into multiple
streams of individual data types. Only the source stream handler can set
this flag. This flag is mutually exclusive with the SPCBBUF_USERPROVIDED
flag. The SPCBBUF_FIXEDBUF cannot be used with this flag set.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_MAXSIZE - The<I> ulBufSize</I> field contains
that maximum size buffer that this stream handler can handle.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBBUF_16MEG - The stream buffers may be allocated
above 16MB. This is used by stream handlers device drivers that can support
greater than 16MB addresses.<!-- lm: 0x2 26 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Handler
Flag<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Stream handler flags (that is, the handler
can generate and receive sync pulses, and use the Sync/Stream Manager timer
as the master, non-streaming handler).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_GENSYNC - This stream handler can generate
sync pulses.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_RCVSYNC - This stream handler can receive
sync pulses.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_NONSTREAM - This stream handler is a non-streaming
handler (that is, a stream handler that can participate in synchronization,
but does not stream).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_GENTIME - This stream handler can keep track
of the real stream time. This handler also supports the<I> SpiGetTime</I> and
cuepoint events.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_NOPREROLL - This stream handler cannot preroll
its device (that is, for recording streams, the source stream handler cannot
be prerolled).  The Sync/Stream Manager will treat this stream as if it
were prerolled if asked to preroll this stream.<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_NOSYNC - This stream handler can be in a
sync group but does not receive or generate sync pulses. (It is useful to
group streams together so that they can be manipulated as a group).<!-- lm: 0x2 28 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->SPCBHAND_PHYS_SEEK - This stream handler does a seek
to a physical device. Other stream handlers only adjust stream time on a
seek request. The Sync/Stream Manager will always call this stream handler
first on a call to the<I> SpiSeekStream</I> function.<!-- lm: 0x2 26 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Resync
Tolerance<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Resync tolerance value. It is used to
determine whether to send a sync pulse to this specific slave stream handler,
if it is a slave.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Sync Pulse Granularity<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Time
interval in MMTIME units between sync pulses. Used to save sync pulse generation
granularity if this stream handler is a master, but cannot generate its
own sync pulse.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Bytes Per Unit<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Bytes
per unit of time. This is used to do seeks on linear data that is not compressed
or of variable length. It is also used for SHC_GETTIME queries in a stream
handler.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MMTIME Per Unit<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The
amount of MMTIME each unit represents. This is also used for the seek and
"get time" functions of a stream handler.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
