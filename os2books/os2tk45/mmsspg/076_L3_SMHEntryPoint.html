<P>
The Stream Manager Helper (SMH) messages are exported for use by both device
driver and DLL stream handlers through the SMHEntryPoint. The stream handlers
use these helper routines to register with the Sync/Stream Manager, report
events and synchronization cues, and request or return buffers. They are
synchronous calls and are available to Ring 3 DLL stream handlers as a DLL
call (Ring 0 stream handlers as an IDC call).
