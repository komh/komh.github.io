<H1>Command Tables</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
<I>Command tables</I> are structures that allow the MDM string parser to
interpret command strings for MCDs.  This provides string command interface
support for your MCD. Represented as resources to the driver, command tables
are created using the RCDATA type of resource.  The resource number of the
RCDATA block is the device type number.
<P>
The following figure illustrates how the Media Device Manager (MDM) uses
commands tables.  A program or mciRxInit command uses the mciSendString
function to pass a string command to the MDM.  In turn, MDM calls its string
parser to interpret the string command and change it into the equivalent
procedural command.  MDM scans the command tables from the most specific
to the least specific.  It first scans any custom device-specific tables
(if present in the MCD).  Next, MDM looks for the string in the device-type
table and finally the system default table.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="028_L2_CommandTables_6.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=480>
<P>
MDM provides device-type tables to support OS/2 multimedia logical devices
as shown in the above figure. These built-in tables will meet your MCD requirements
unless you have to add or modify commands.  If your MCD has new requirements
(such as a new flag or a different data structure for a command), you must
create a custom table to define commands specific to your device.
<P>
A custom table allows you to create your own versions of basic media control
interface commands by adding new or changed command entries.  For example,
the device-type table for digital video supports the SEEK flags shown in
the following example.
<PRE>"seek",                  MCI_SEEK, 0,           MCI_COMMAND_HEAD,
   "notify",             MCI_NOTIFY,            MCI_FLAG,
   "wait",               MCI_WAIT,              MCI_FLAG,
   "to start",           MCI_TO_START,          MCI_FLAG,
   "to end",             MCI_TO_END,            MCI_FLAG,
   "to",                 MCI_TO,                MCI_INTEGER,
"",                      0L,                    MCI_END_COMMAND,
</PRE>

<P>
You, however, want your MCD to seek to the nearest position.  To accomplish
this, you can create a custom table in your MCD to parse commands for the
digital video player (as shown in the following example. Note that the custom
table must include<I> all</I> parameters associated with the changed command
(not just new and changed parameters).
<PRE>"seek",                  MCI_SEEK, 0,           MCI_COMMAND_HEAD,
   "notify",             MCI_NOTIFY,            MCI_FLAG,
   "wait",               MCI_WAIT,              MCI_FLAG,
   "to start",           MCI_TO_START,          MCI_FLAG,
   "to nearest",         MCI_TO_NEAREST,        MCI_FLAG,
   "to end",             MCI_TO_END,            MCI_FLAG,
   "to",                 MCI_TO,                MCI_INTEGER,
"",                      0L,                    MCI_END_COMMAND,
</PRE>

<P>
When writing an MCD, the DLL file names (which include the command table
resources) must be referenced in the MMPM2.INI file.  MDM updates the INI
file with MCD command table information you provide when installing your
MCD.  See <A HREF="140_L2_InstallingaMediaCont.html">Installing a Media
Control Driver</A> for details.
<P>
The following shows an example of how command table entries appear in the
MMPM2.INI file.  The MCDTABLE entry includes the MDM.DLL file, which includes
the device-type command tables and the default system table.  The VSDTABLE
entry indicates that a custom command table resource is located in the SVMC.DLL
file.
<P>
MDM scans the command tables from the most specific to the least specific.
 In the example below MDM first searches the custom table resources in the
SVMC.DLL file.  MDM next searches the internal digitalvideo device-type
table (SMVCMD.RC) and then the system default table (MDMCMD.RC) located
in the MDM.DLL file.
