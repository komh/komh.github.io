<H1>Error Detection</H1><!-- entering slot 112 -->
<P>
Stream handlers can detect errors and report them back to the Sync/Stream
Manager to be passed back to the media driver. Once a physical device driver
detects an error, the PDD must report the error to the stream handler through
the SHDEntryPoint. In turn, the stream handler takes the appropriate action.
If the error is a hard error, the stream handler must stop the device and
report an event to the Sync/Stream Manager. The stream handler indicates
that a hard error took place by referencing the error code number. For normal
events, such as underruns and overruns, the target stream handler will attempt
to get another buffer and then pause its device. The target stream handler
will be restarted when more data is available to be output. This condition
results in a break in the output data stream.  Interleaved data format can
cause underruns to occur when the end of the data is reached, but end of
file has not been reached.
<P>
The code sample in the following example illustrates the code implementation
of a stream handler detecting an error.
<PRE>RptEvent.ulFunction = SMH_REPORTEVENT;
RptEvent.hid = pSTREAM-&gt;hid;
RptEvent.hevent = 0;                         /* must be 0 */
RptEvent.pevcbEvent = (PEVCB)&amp;evcb;

evcb.ulType = EVENT_IMPLICIT_TYPE;              /* SPI event */
evcb.ulSubType = EVENT_ERROR;                   /* event type */
evcb.ulFlags = 0;
evcb.ulStatus = EVENT_ERROR;                    /* error code */
evcb.hstream = pSTREAM-&gt;hStream;
/***********************************/
/* call SSM to report event arrival*/
/***********************************/
VideoSH.pSMHEntryPoint(&amp;Ramp.ptEvent);              /* report it! */
