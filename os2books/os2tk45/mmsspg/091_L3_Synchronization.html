<P>
Each stream handler may, or may not, be able to generate or receive sync
pulses. This capability for each stream handler is defined in the SPCB for
that stream handler. Synchronization pulses are passed as an event from
the master stream handler.
<P>
Synchronization pulses are distributed by the Sync/Stream Manager based
on the synchronization relationship of the programmed stream. This distribution
is effective for both DLL and device driver stream handlers. Device driver
stream handlers receive sync pulses through their sync pulse SYNC_EVCB.
Each slave stream handler must regularly update the sync pulse SYNC_EVCB
with its calculated stream time. The Sync/Stream Manager checks this slave-handler
stream time against the master stream time and decides whether to send a
sync pulse to this handler. The device driver stream handler checks for
sync pulses from the Sync/Stream Manager by polling a flag in the sync pulse
SYNC_EVCB. The Sync/Stream Manager sets the flag to indicate a sync pulse
and updates the current master stream time. Typically, the PDD slave handler
polls the flag once during interrupt processing and adjusts the stream usage
accordingly. Refer to the following example for an example of how device
driver stream handlers support synchronization.
