<P>
The real-time MIDI subsystem (RTMIDI) provides support for handling real-time
MIDI operations for applications.
<P>
To provide a robust system for real-time MIDI processing, RTMIDI uses an
object-oriented paradigm.<I> Nodes</I> are entities that can send or receive
MIDI messages, perhaps manipulating the messages before sending them back
out again. Nodes that only manipulate messages are called<I> filter nodes</I>.
Nodes that can generate messages are called<I> source nodes</I>.
<P>
There are node classes and node instances, where the term node implies<I> node
instance</I>. In an object-oriented programming language, classes define
what variables and operations are available and what they are called. When
a class is instantiated, an object that has a physical existence is created.
RTMIDI operates the same way.
<P>
When a node wants to be "known" by RTMIDI, it must first register a<I> node
class</I>. This step is only necessary for user-defined classes, since the
pre-defined classes are registered by default. Registration provides two
pieces of information for RTMIDI:  the name of the class and the addresses
of all the requisite functions. For example, RTMIDI will need to know what
function to call to send a message to the node.
<P>
Once a class is registered, it can be instantiated.  And once instantiated,
it can be connected to other instances. The collection of instances and
links is known as the<I> node network</I>. Each instance of a class also
has its own instance data. When an instance is created, RTMIDI allocates
a block of memory. Whenever any of the functions for this class are called,
the instance data pointer is passed. This allows a particular function to
determine which instance is being called and also allows it to store instance-specific
data.
<P>
Instances are sometimes called nodes, especially if they are qualified by
their class.  For example, a hardware node is an instance of the hardware
class.
