<P>
The stream handler passes a pointer to the PDD on DDCMD_SETUP. This points
to a value used by the PDD for setting the referenced time of the PDD. We
do not always want the PDD to start its time at 0 every time the stream
handler does a start, because the stream handler might have performed a
seek in the stream. The PDD might have played a minute of data and then
seeked backwards to maybe the 30-second mark in the data. If we issue a
start, we do not want the PDD to think it is starting from zero again when
it is really starting from the 30-second mark in that stream.
<P>
DDCMD_CONTROL has an important NOTIFY subfunction, which is used for cuepoint
or event detection. The stream handler supports events in cuepoints-an application
request to be notified when a particular location in the file is reached
or a specific time period has elapsed. The stream handler uses two methods
for detecting how much time has elapsed:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Using DDCMD_CONTROL NOTIFY, the stream handler
requests to be notified by the PDD at a particular time and passes a pointer
to the cue time.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The stream handler determines the time internally.
This method is not as precise as the first method, because only the PDD
knows the real time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example, suppose the stream handler does a DDCMD_CONTROL NOTIFY at one
minute. If the PDD supports precise event detection, it must accept this
request and put it into a queue somewhere, preferably a linked list. This
linked list will have the time of one minute so that during the streaming
process, the PDD occasionally checks to see whether it is at the one minute
mark.  When this event occurs, the PDD calls back on an SHD_REPORT_EVENT.
Then, the programmer can free up that event detection linked list node.

<P>
Keep in mind that the PDD should have the capability to queue these requests
because there may additional requests. For example, an application might
request to be notified at the one-minute mark, next at a minute and a half,
and possibly every five minutes.
<P>
If the PDD does not support event detection, then when it gets called on
a DDCMD_CONTROL NOTIFY, he responds ERROR_INVALID_REQUEST.  This response
tells the stream handler that it must do the event detection itself.
