<H1>Reassociating the Stream on MCI_LOAD</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
Typically, a stream is destroyed, recreated, and then associated with a
new file.  However, you can bypass these steps and reassociate a new file
with an existing stream as long as the file is of the same data type as
the stream was created to handle.  For example, in the case of waveaudio,
if you had a 16-bit 11KB WAVE stream, the file you want to associate with
the stream must be of the same data type and sub type.
<P>
Note that only one data object may be associated with a stream once the
stream is created, and it is specific to a particular stream handler (source
or target).  Associations may be changed, but the stream cannot be active;
it must be stopped first (discard stop, flush stop, or EOS).
