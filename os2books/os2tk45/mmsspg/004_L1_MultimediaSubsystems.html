<P>
OS/2 multimedia (referred to as Multimedia Presentation Manager/2 or MMPM/2
in previous releases) has an extendable architecture that makes it possible
to add new functions, devices, and multimedia data formats as the technology
of multimedia advances.  This chapter provides a general overview of the
subsystem components provided with the OS/2 multimedia system.  Subsequent
chapters include detailed guidelines on how to develop and install your
own OS/2 multimedia subsystem through the use of the sample programs illustrated
in the following figure. Each sample program serves as a template that can
be modified easily to meet your multimedia requirements. Use these sample
programs to develop and install media control drivers, stream handlers,
and I/O procedures for OS/2 multimedia.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="004_L1_MultimediaSubsystems_0.gif" WIDTH=553 HEIGHT=593>
