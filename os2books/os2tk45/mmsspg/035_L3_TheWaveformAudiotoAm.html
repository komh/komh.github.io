<H1>The Waveform Audio to Amp-Mixer Connection</H1><!-- entering slot 40 -->
<P>
Because its primary purpose is to play and record waveform data, the waveform
audio MCD routes an MCI_SET application request to set audio attributes.
 The waveform audio MCD can route requests to the amp mixer because a default
logical connection exists from the waveform audio MCD to the ampmixer MCD.

<P>
A default connection is the name of a connected device, while a device-context
connection is the actual handle to a particular instance of an opened device.
The waveaudio device has a default connection to an ampmixer device.  When
the waveaudio device is opened, it automatically opens the ampmix device
creating an instance of each device.  Since devices may be shared in OS/2
multimedia, the waveaudio device can be opened again by another application
and two new instances are created.  While the default connection is the
same in both cases, the device context connections are different.
<P>
The code fragment in the following example illustrates how the waveaudio
device gets a default connection and opens an associated amp mixer.  The
waveform audio MCD uses the device handle of the amp mixer to route any
requests to change the volume.
<P>
An application can retrieve the amp mixer handle by issuing the MCI_CONNECTION
message.  This is necessary if the application needs to use any advanced
audio shaping functions such as treble, bass, balance, and so on.
