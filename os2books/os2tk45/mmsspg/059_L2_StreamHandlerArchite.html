<H1>Stream Handler Architecture</H1><!-- entering slot 73 -->
<P>
Pairs of stream handlers implement the transport of data from a source to
a target device while the Synchronization and Streaming Manager (SSM) provides
coordination and central management of data buffers and synchronization
data.
<P>
A stream handler can be built as a device driver run at Ring 0, or as a
dynamic-link library (DLL) run at Ring 3. See <A HREF="073_L2_DLLModelFileSystemSt.html">DLL
Model: File System Stream Handler</A> and <A HREF="081_L2_DeviceDriverModelVid.html">Device
Driver Model: Video PDD</A> for examples of these stream handler types.

<P>
Some streams are ideally controlled by a direct connection between the stream
handler and a physical device driver, whereas other streams are not associated
with a data source or target that maps physically to a specific device.
 For example, the File System Stream Handler is a DLL because all file system
I/O functions are available as Ring 3 OS/2 functions that service all file
system devices.
<P>
After you determine the type of stream handler you require (DLL or DD),
you must incorporate the required functional modules in your stream handler
design. Refer to the following figure, which represents the key modules
in both DLL and device driver stream handler components.
<P>
Although the detailed coding practices of building OS/2 DLLs and device
drivers differ considerably, most logic for a stream handler is not affected
by this choice. The structure of the DLL stream handler closely resembles
the device driver stream handler, with few exceptions.
<P>
The following figure illustrates the logical structure of the Sync/Stream
Manager (SSM) and its relationship with stream handlers. The Sync/Stream
Manager DLL exports SPI services to higher-level OS/2 multimedia components
(such as media drivers) and exports Stream Manager Helper (SMH) messages
to support the stream handler DLLs. Additional SMH messages are exported
by the Sync/Stream Manager device driver to stream handler device drivers
using standard OS/2 inter-device driver communication (IDC) interfaces (established
using DevHelp_AttachDD).<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="059_L2_StreamHandlerArchite_12.gif" WIDTH=628 HEIGHT=429>

The following table illustrates the stream handlers are provided by OS/2
multimedia.

and operation of the stream handlers provided with OS/2 multimedia.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
