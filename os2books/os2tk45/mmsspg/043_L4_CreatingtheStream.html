<H1>Creating the Stream</H1><!-- entering slot 48 -->
<P>
After handler IDs are obtained and the SPCBKEY and DCB information is filled
in, the MCD makes the call to SpiCreateStream.  At this point the two handlers
are initiated to create their stream, buffers are allocated, and the stage
is set for streaming.
<P>
The following example code illustrates how to create the stream.  The caller
supplies the source and target stream handlers and the audio device control
block should have been filled in previously (see MCIOPEN.C). The caller
also supplies the EventProc(edure) where all of the stream events will be
reported.
<PRE>  ulrc = SpiCreateStream ( hidSrc,
                           hidTgt,
                           &amp;pInstance-&gt;StreamInfo.SpcbKey,
                           (PDCB) &amp;pInstance-&gt;StreamInfo.AudioDCB,
                           (PDCB) &amp;pInstance-&gt;StreamInfo.AudioDCB,
                           (PIMPL_EVCB) &amp;pInstance-&gt;StreamInfo.Evcb,
                           (PEVFN) EventProc,
                           (ULONG) NULL,
                           hStream,
                           &amp;pInstance-&gt;StreamInfo.hEvent);

</PRE>

<P>
When the MCD creates a stream, it must register a callback handle with SSM.
 The callback handle is an entry point or function within the MCD code that
processes events coming back from SSM during the streaming process.  The
callback handle is a powerful mechanism because it frees the driver to do
other work during the streaming process.  When an event occurs, SSM detects
it and reports it to the callback address.
<P>

<P>
The MEVCB structure in the RecordEventRoutine is a modified IMPL_EVCB which
SSM uses to<!-- entering slot 49 --> report events (see the<I> OS/2 Multimedia
Programming Reference</I>).  You can add additional fields to extend the
EVCB structure.  For example, MEVCB shown in the following example adds
an instance pointer containing local instance data.  When the Sync/Stream
Manager calls the waveform audio MCD, it allows the MCD to have access to
the local instance data, which is tied to that event.
<P>
The PlayEventRoutine shown in the following example is presumed to receive
all types of event notifications from SSM.  The types include implicit events
and cue point notifications in terms of both time and data.  In response
to cue point notifications a MCI_CUEPOINT message is returned to MDM by
way of mdmDriverNotify.

<P>
Events reported by SSM can be normal occurrences, such as an end-of-stream
because<!-- entering slot 50 --> playback is complete, or the events can
be abnormal occurrences, such as an error returned during the streaming
process.  The driver needs to know about these events.
<P>
SSM reports two types of events:<I> implicit</I> and<I> explicit</I>. <I> Implicit
</I>events are always reported.  When one occurs, the driver must receive
the notification of its occurrence from SSM, however, it does not have to
take any action.
<P>
An<I> explicit</I> event is reported to the driver only when the driver
requests to be notified of the event's occurrence.  For example, the driver
requests cuepoint notifications.
