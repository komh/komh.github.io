Device driver stream handlers send Stream Manager Helper (SMH) routines
to the SSM through the SMHEntryPoint. The stream handlers use these helper
routines to register with the Sync/Stream Manager, report events and synchronization
cues, and to request or return buffers. This interface is created using
the standard inter-device driver communication (IDC) approach, established
by the AttachDD DevHelp function during initialization processing.
