<P>
The MINSTALL program (MINSTALL.EXE) requires specific file information to
install each subsystem.  This file information is provided by the master
control file CONTROL.SCR.  The master control file, CONTROL.SCR, tells the
installation program what to install, where to install it, how to display
it to the user, and what system files need to be updated.  CONTROL.SCR uses
keywords to specify these instructions to MINSTALL.
<P>
This control file must be named CONTROL.SCR and must reside on the first
media unit (diskette or CD) of the installation package.  During installation,
if any errors are detected in the master control file, the errors are logged
in the MINSTALL.LOG file.  (See <A HREF="148_L2_InstallationLOGFile.html">Installation
LOG File</A>.)
<P>
The CONTROL.SCR file consists of a header section and a subsystem definition
section.  The header section comes first and provides general information
for the installation procedure.  The subsystem definition section comes
next and provides information about the subsystems in the installation package.
