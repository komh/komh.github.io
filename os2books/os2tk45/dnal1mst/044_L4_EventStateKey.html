This attribute identifies a row in the event state group associated with
the component definition that contains this event generation group. The
value of the current state attribute (<A HREF="056_L4_CurrentState.html">Current
State</A>) within the specified row indicates the current state of the event.
If the generated event is not state-based, the value of the event state
key attribute is ignored.

This attribute is required in the event generation group.

              "which the event generator group is located. The "
              "Current State attribute within the row contains "
              "the current state of this state-based event. The "
              "current state can be one of the four severities: "
