<P>
The Internet protocol suite is still evolving through Requests for Comments
(RFCs).  New protocols are being designed and implemented by researchers
and are brought to the attention of the Internet community in the form of
RFCs.
<P>
As networks have grown in size and complexity, SNMP has emerged as the Internet
network management standard. The following RFCs provide information relevant
to SNMP and related to SystemView Agent:
<P>
<I>RFC 1155: Structure and Identification of Management Information for
TCP/IP-based Internets</I>
<P>
This RFC provides a set of rules used to define and identify MIB objects.

<P>
<I>RFC 1157:  A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</I>
<P>
This RFC defines the protocol used to manage objects defined in a MIB.
<P>
<I>RFC 1212:  Concise MIB Definitions</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1213:  Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based
Internets:  MIB-II</I>
<P>
This RFC defines a base set of managed objects to be provided in a MIB.

<P>
<I>RFC 1592, SNMP Distributed Protocol Interface (DPI), Version 2.0</I>
<P>
This RFC describes the protocol to allow an SNMP agent to communicate with
a subagent. This allows users to dynamically add, delete, or replace MIB
objects without recompiling the SNMP agent.
<P>
<I>RFC 1901, Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1902, Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1903, Textual  Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1904, Conformance  Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1905, Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1906, Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1907, Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMPv2)</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1908, Coexistence between Version 1 and Version 2 of the Internet-standard
Network Management Framework</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1909, An Administrative Infrastructure for SNMPv2</I>
<P>
<I>RFC 1910, User-based Security Model for SNMPv2</I>
