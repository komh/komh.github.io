<P>
The character sets that can be used with the MIF conform to one of the following
standards:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The International Standards Organization document
ISO 8859-1 (Latin Alphabet No. 1)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The Unicode 1.1 specification<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If a MIF is created according to the Unicode specification, the first two
octets of the MIF file must be X'0xFE' and X'0xFF'. If the service layer
does not detect these values in the MIF file, the service layer treats the
file as an ISO 8859-1 MIF.
<P>
There are four classes of tokens: keywords, integer constants, literal strings,
and separators. Blanks, tabs, newlines, carriage returns and comments (known
collectively as<I> white space</I>) are ignored except as they serve to
separate tokens, such as adjacent keywords and constants.
<P>
When interpreting tokens, the MIF is not case sensitive, unless the token
is a literal string enclosed within double quote (") characters. Case is
retained for the contents of a literal string. Literal strings separated
by white space are concatenated and stored as one literal string.
