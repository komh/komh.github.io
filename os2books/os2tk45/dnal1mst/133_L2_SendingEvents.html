<P>
When a component encounters an error situation or needs to notify a management
application of a status change, for example, the component sends an event
to the service layer. If a management application has requested to receive
unsolicited notifications from that component, the service layer forwards
the event to the management application as an indication.
<P>
You can use events to enhance the manageability of your component by providing
detailed information about the status of the component and by notifying
management applications of these changes in a timely manner. Events are
especially useful when a serious error or similar change has occurred and
the management application must be informed immediately.
<P>
Events are issued with the DmiIndicate function call. The service layer
processes the events as they are received and returns a status value indicating
the success or failure of the DmiIndicate call. For more information about
the DmiIndicate call and its associated command blocks, read <A HREF="094_L3_DmiIndicate.html">DmiIndicate
Command Block</A>.
