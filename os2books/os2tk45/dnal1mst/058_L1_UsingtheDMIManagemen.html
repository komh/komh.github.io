<H1>Using the DMI Management Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 58 -->
<P>
This chapter describes how a management application communicates with the
DMI through the Management Interface (MI). A management application requests
information about components in the system by issuing the DMI Get, Set,
and List commands. However, before it can manage a component in the system,
the application must register with the service layer for that particular
system. Once registered, the application can issue commands, as well as
receive notifications of indications. It is the responsibility of the management
application to have program code in place to process the error codes returned
by the service layer.
<P>
This chapter describes how a management application communicates with the
MI, including the registration process that the application must use and
the status codes that the service layer returns.
