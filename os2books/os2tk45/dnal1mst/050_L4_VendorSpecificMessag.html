<P>
This attribute is used to pass displayable string data to a management application.
The string can be in any locale, as long as it can be displayed using the
ISO 8859-1 character set. This definition does not specify a size limit
for the string.
<P>
This attribute is optional in the event generation group.
<P>
The syntax of the vendor-specific-message definition is:
<PRE>name = "event message"
id = 10
description = "Auxiliary information related to the event."
type = string(&lt;size&gt;)
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = ""
</PRE>

<P>
This attribute, along with the vendor specific data attribute (<A HREF="051_L4_VendorSpecificMessag.html">Vendor
Specific Message</A>), is designed to provide event generators and consumers
with an efficient, private interface with which to pass arbitrary information.
This can be useful to manufacturers that develop both component instrumentation
and management applications.
