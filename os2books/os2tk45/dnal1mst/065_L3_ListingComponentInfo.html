<P>
List Component commands request a list of the components in a system. This
command can be used to return all components in a system or only those with
a certain group class. Calls for all components are referred to as<I> unfiltered</I>,
and calls for a specific group class are<I> filtered</I>.
<P>
There are three List Component commands:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DmiListComponentCmd<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> Requests data for a specific
component.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DmiListFirstComponentCmd<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> Requests
data for the first component in a system. The component with the lowest
component ID is considered the first component in the system. This will
always be the service layer itself, which always has component ID of 1.
The service layer fills in as many component definitions as the size of
the confirm buffer allows.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DmiListNextComponentCmd
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>Requests data for the component instrumentation
whose ID is the next highest value after the one passed in the DmiListComponentCmd
block. The service layer fills in as many component definitions as the size
of the confirm buffer allows.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For a description of the DmiListComponentReq block used to issue these List
commands, read <A HREF="101_L3_DmiListComponentReq.html">DmiListComponentReq
Command Block</A>.
<P>
The service layer does not contact any component instrumentation when performing
List commands. It relies on the MIF database for all information. When specifying
keys that require components to be run before the values can be determined,
the service layer returns the key as a possible match. Any matches from
data in the MIF database are listed as hard matches. It is the responsibility
of the management application to follow up with each component instrumentation
and convert possible matches into hard matches.
