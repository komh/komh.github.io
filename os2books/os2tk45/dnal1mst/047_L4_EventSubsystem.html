<P>
The event subsystem attribute provides information about the functional
subsystem of the product that generated the event. A management application
can use the values of the event system attribute (<A HREF="046_L4_EventSystem.html">Event
System</A>) and this attribute to construct a simple message describing
the event.
<P>
This attribute is required in the event generation group.
<P>
The syntax of the event subsystem definition is:
<PRE>name = "event subsystem"
id = 7
description = "The minor functional aspect of the product "
              "causing the fault."
type = &lt;enumeration&gt;
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = 0
</PRE>

<P>
The enumeration list is unique to the event generation group being defined
and is not specified in this example.
