<H1>Invoking a Command through the Management Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 59 -->
<P>
Because the DMI is a data interface, all commands are specified with data
blocks. In order for a management application to send a command block to
the service layer, the application builds the command with the DmiMgmtCommand
block and any following blocks and then issues the<I> DmiInvoke()</I> function
call.
<P>
The DmiInvoke() function call sends the command to the service layer for
processing. The C-language prototype for this call is:
<PRE>unsigned long DmiInvoke(PTR command)
</PRE>

<P>
<I>command</I> is the complete command block. The return result is a 32-bit
status value that indicates whether the command succeeded or failed. The
possible status values are described in <A HREF="074_L2_StatusCodes.html">Status
Codes</A>.
<P>
While it processes the command, the service layer immediately returns control
to the management application. The management application can then continue
processing and issue additional commands, but the application cannot re-use
the same DmiMgmtCommand buffer that it previously sent to the service layer.
Simultaneous commands from a management application must use different DmiMgmtCommand
blocks. When the service layer is finished processing the command, it notifies
the management application by calling the pConfirmFunc() function that was
given when the management application originally registered with the service
layer. At that point, the management application can re-use the DmiMgmtCommand
block.
<P>
The DMI specification does not include a time-out policy. If a management
application issues a command and does not appear to get a response, the
application should issue a cancel command. <A HREF="160_L1_ImplementingDMIonOS2.html">Implementing
DMI on OS/2</A> describes how the SystemView Agent incorporates time restrictions
on some operations.
<P>
For a description of the DmiMgmtCommand block and its contents, read <A HREF="091_L3_DmiMgmtCommand.html">DmiMgmtCommand
Command Block</A>.
