<H1>Defining the Product's MIF File</H1><!-- entering slot 127 -->
<P>
A MIF file is an ASCII text file that conforms to the Management Information
Format (MIF) described in the<I> DMI Specification</I>. The MIF file for
a component defines the manageable aspects of the component and provides
this information to management applications through the DMI. Because the
DMI does not assume that a management application can determine anything
about a component in the system, it is important that the component provide
all significant information about its manageable characteristics through
the MIF file.
<P>
The steps involved for defining a MIF file include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Determining what characteristics of the component
can be managed<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Defining the groups into which these characteristics
will be organized<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Defining the attributes that make up the groups<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A MIF file can contain as few as one group with the six standard attributes
or as many groups and attributes as you choose.
