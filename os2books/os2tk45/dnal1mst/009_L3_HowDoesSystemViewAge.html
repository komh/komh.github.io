<H1>How Does SystemView Agent Use the DMI?</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
The SystemView Agent program extends the use of the DMI by providing a MIF
conversion utility and a DMI subagent that performs mapping of DMI information
into SNMP MIB information. Each MIF file in the system can be translated
to an SNMP MIB with the conversion utility and then loaded in a remote SNMP
management application. The management application can send requests to
the DMI subagent, which in turn converts the SNMP request into a DMI request.
The conversion is performed again, in reverse, when the DMI response is
returned. This enables the SNMP management application to participate in
active management of DMI-enabled components.
<P>
The DMI subagent's ability to perform this MIF-to-MIB mapping enables an
SNMP management application to manage any component that implements the
DMI.
