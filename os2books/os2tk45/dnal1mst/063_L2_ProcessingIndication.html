<H1>Processing Indications</H1><!-- entering slot 63 -->
<P>
An indication is an unsolicited report that is not expected by the receiving
application. Registration provides a mechanism for management applications
to register for notification of indications.
<P>
The service layer maintains a list of entry points for registered management
applications. Each entry point is called when the service layer generates
an indication. The called routine must immediately return control to the
service layer and perform any operations necessary based on the indication.
The routine informs the service layer that it has finished processing the
report by calling the function<I> pResponseFunc()</I>, as given in the DmiIndicate
block.
<P>
For a description of the DmiIndicate block and its contents, read <A HREF="094_L3_DmiIndicate.html">DmiIndicate
Command Block</A>.
<P>
Each registered indication entry point is called for every indication.
<P>
Management applications must unregister their entry points before terminating.
