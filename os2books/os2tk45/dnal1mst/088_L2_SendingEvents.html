<H1>Sending Events</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
Component instrumentation can send unsolicited messages to the service layer
to notify it of some particular situation. These unsolicited messages are
known as events. When they reach a management application they are usually
known as indications, with an indication ID of 1. Events are often used
to describe a catastrophic occurrence or other activity that a management
application should be informed of quickly. The event identification is specific
to a given component.
<P>
The DmiIndicate() function call is provided so that component instrumentation
can send an indication block to the service layer for processing. The C-language
prototype for this call is:
<PRE>unsigned long  DmiIndicate(PTR command)
</PRE>

<P>
<I>command</I> is the complete command block. The return result is a 32-bit
status value indicating success or failure. The possible status values are
described in <A HREF="074_L2_StatusCodes.html">Status Codes</A>.
<P>
While it processes the indication, the service layer immediately returns
control to the component instrumentation. The component instrumentation
can then continue processing and issue additional indications, but the instrumentation
cannot re-use the same indication buffer that it previously sent to the
service layer. Simultaneous indications from a component instrumentation
must use different indication blocks. When the service layer is finished
processing the indication, it notifies the component instrumentation by
calling the pResponseFunc() function that was given in the original indication
block. At that point, the component instrumentation can re-use the indication
block.
<P>
To send an event, the component instrumentation sends a DmiIndicate block
to the service layer's DmiIndicate() entry point. The event data is defined
in a DmiEventData block that maps onto the oIndicationData field in the
DmiIndicate block.
<P>
For a description of the DmiIndicate block used to issue an indication,
read <A HREF="094_L3_DmiIndicate.html">DmiIndicate Command Block</A>.
<P>
If you are using the DMI subagent to translate DMI indications into SNMP
traps, note the following when creating indications:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Keep the length of any strings passed in a DmiIndicate()
call to 512 characters or less. Strings longer than this limit are truncated
to 512 characters in the corresponding SNMP trap.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restrict the size and number of variables associated
with each DMI indicate such that the indication will fit within the maximum
SNMP frame size supported in your network.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
