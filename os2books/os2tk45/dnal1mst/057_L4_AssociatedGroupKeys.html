<P>
This attribute is used to identify an instance of the associated group that
is likely to have generated the event. Depending on how the associated group
is defined, there might be multiple keys, each of a different type. This
attribute represents such a list of keys with an encoded string consisting
of a list of integers separated by commas, with no spaces.
<P>
The syntax of the associated-group-keys definition is:
<PRE>name = "associated group keys"
id = 5
description = "A list of integer keys that identify the instance "
              "of the Associated Group that actually generated "
              "the state-based event. The list of integer keys "
              "are represented in the value of this attribute as "
              "a string containing a comma-separated list of "
              "integers. The management application must parse "
              "this string to obtain the list of integer keys."
type = string(256)
access = read-only
