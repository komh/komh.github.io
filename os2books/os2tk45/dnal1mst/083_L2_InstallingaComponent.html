<H1>Installing a Component</H1><!-- entering slot 83 -->
<P>
A component identifies itself to the management system by installing a MIF
file into the MIF database. The component installs the MIF file the first
time it is introduced to the system. This is the only time that the component
needs to perform this installation.
<P>
A MIF is installed and removed using the DmiCiInstall and DmiCiUninstall
commands. These are the only primitives provided to manipulate the MIF database.
There are no MIF database modification mechanisms. If an installed MIF requires
modification, it must be removed, modified, and then re-installed.
<P>
Upon installation or removal of a MIF file, the service layer issues an
indication to all registered management applications.
<P>
The installation can optionally include files that provide language mapping
and mapping logic between the MIF file and other management information
standards.
<P>
For a description of the DmiCiInstallData block issued when installing a
component, read <A HREF="115_L3_DmiCiInstallData.html">DmiCiInstallData
Command Block</A>.
<P>
On successful return, iComponentId is set to a numeric ID assigned by the
service layer. This ID uniquely identifies the component described by the
installation. This system-specific ID is stored by the service layer in
the MIF database. The MIF database is a persistent data store, so the component
ID, once assigned, remains the same until the component is removed. The
component must remember this component ID, as it is used when issuing indications
or when the component is removed from the system.
<P>
Upon successful installation, the service layer sends an indication to every
management application that is currently registered with it. If the installation
created a new component, the value of iIndicationType in the DmiIndicate
block is 2. If the installation resulted in any additional MIFs being added
to an existing component, the value of iIndicationType is 4. In both cases,
the indication data is a DmiListComponentCnf block. The DmiIndicate function
call is described in <A HREF="094_L3_DmiIndicate.html">DmiIndicate Command
Block</A>.
