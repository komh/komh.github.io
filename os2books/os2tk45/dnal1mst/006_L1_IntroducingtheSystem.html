<H1>Introducing the SystemView Agent and the DMI</H1><!-- entering slot 6 -->
<P>
With the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the SystemView Agent
program provides remote management applications with access to DMI-enabled
products in a system. Local management applications that can communicate
with the DMI can also query and set MIF information for DMI-enabled components.

<P>
This book describes the steps necessary to design and implement management
applications and manageable products with DMI technology. The information
presented here is accompanied with examples of program code to help show
how the DMI elements can be implemented. All of the examples used in this
book in their complete form are in the the following directories:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
