<P>
The Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) is a vendor alliance. This alliance
was convened to streamline the management of diverse operating systems commonly
found in an enterprise.  The DMTF includes industry-wide workgroups, which
identify the pieces of information that are necessary to manage specific
categories of devices.
<P>
As part of this effort, the DMTF has published a standard that is called
the<I> Desktop Management Interface Specification</I>.
<P>
The SystemView Agent program provides access to system components that have
been defined according to the DMI standard by acting as an SNMP agent. Although
the DMI itself is protocol-independent, SystemView Agent can detect any
DMI-enabled components in the system and translate the MIF information into
SNMP objects that conform to the management information base (MIB) format.
This MIF-to-MIB mapping is performed automatically by a DMI subagent provided
with SystemView Agent.
