<H1>Path Definition</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
The path definition is used to specify the location of the files used for
active management of the component. The MIF file for a component can contain
more than one path definition, as long as the name statement for each path
definition is unique within the component definition.
<P>
The operating system identifiers used in the path definition include<B> dos</B>,
<B>macos</B>,<B> os2</B>,<B> unix</B>,<B> win16</B>,<B> win32</B>,<B> win9x</B>,
and<B> winnt</B>. These identifiers are not case sensitive.
<P>
If you specify a keyword of<B> win32</B>, you are indicating that the component
instrumentation referenced in this definition runs on either Windows NT
or Windows 95 (or greater). Use of<B> winnt</B> or<B> win9x</B> indicates
that the instrumentation runs<I> only</I> on the platform specified by the
keyword.
<P>
The syntax for the path definition is:
<PRE>start path
      name  = "name identifying instrumentation code"
      win32 = "C:\\directory\\filename.dll"
      os2   = "direct interface"
      dos   = "C:\\directory\\filename.com"
      unix  = "/directory/filename"
end path
</PRE>

<P>
The keyword direct interface in the example indicates that the component
instrumentation code is a continuously running process that is registered
with the service layer.
<P>
The value of the name statement can be used as part of the attribute definition
to invoke the instrumentation code indicated in the path definition. Read
<A HREF="035_L4_ValueStatement.html">Value Statement</A> for more information
about how the code is invoked.
