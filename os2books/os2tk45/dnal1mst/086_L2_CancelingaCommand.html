<H1>Canceling a Command</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
The service layer can notify the component instrumentation of an intent
to cancel an individual command by calling the DmiCiCancel() entry point
within the component instrumentation. This can be issued as a result of
a management application issuing a DmiCancelCmd command to the service layer.
The C-language prototype for this call is:
<PRE>unsigned long  DmiCiCancel(void)
</PRE>

<P>
No parameters are needed since by definition the component instrumentation
can only be processing one command at a time.
<P>
The return result from the component instrumentation should be zero for
success and non-zero for any error. The service layer will place the result
in iStatus when sending the confirm block to the management application.
