<P>
A direct-interface program runs continuously as a separate process in the
system. As part of its initialization, the program registers with the service
layer and indicates the component with which the program is associated.
When the service layer receives requests from management applications for
information in that component, the service layer passes the request over
to the direct-interface program, which returns the appropriate values.
<P>
An advantage of the direct-interface program is its ability to maintain
up-to-date component information. Because the program is always running,
the attribute values for the component are always current and are not discarded
between requests. The code for a direct-interface program can be added to
the device driver code for the component (if appropriate) or to any other
program that is loaded in the background.
<P>
A disadvantage of the direct-interface program is that it is always loaded
and utilizing resources.
