<P>
An overlay program is invoked by the service layer whenever a management
application requests to retrieve or set the value of an attribute in the
component. The overlay program is loaded into the service layer's process
space and enables the service layer to directly access the attribute values
through the overlay program's procedures. When the request is completed,
the service layer unloads the overlay program.
<P>
Overlay programs are useful for components that do not already have resident
code or for components running in systems with constrained memory. They
are also appropriate if they are called infrequently. The data associated
with your component is not retained by the overlay program between invocations,
unless you specifically designate some storage mechanism for the values.
If your component data must always be available, a direct-interface program
is more appropriate.
