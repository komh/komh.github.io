<H1>Defining Events in the MIF</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
The definition of events for a component is done in the MIF file with the
following groups:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Event Generation Group<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Event State Group<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The event generation group defines the format for events issued by the component.
A management application can issue DMI list commands on the attributes in
this group and display information about the cause of the event. If appropriate,
information about potential solutions to the problem reported by the event
can also be displayed.
<P>
The event state group defines the format of state-based events, which are
issued when the state of the instrumented component changes. For example,
a state-based event might be generated when a device enters a problem state
or when a problem state is resolved.
