<P>
The event type attribute indicates the reason that the event was generated.
The value of this attribute corresponds to an item in the enumeration list
specified by the event type attribute in the associated event generation
group definition. The specific event generation group is identified by the
event generation group attribute (<A HREF="054_L4_EventGenerationGroup.html">Event
Generation Group</A>).
<P>
The syntax of the event type definition is:
<PRE>name = "event type"
id = 3
description = "Integer value that identifies one of the "
              "Event types enumerated in the associated Event "
              "Generation group."
type = integer
storage = common
value = 0
