<P>
The associated group attribute contains the value of the class statement
of the associated group.
<P>
This attribute is a keyed attribute and is required in the event generation
group.
<P>
The syntax of the associated group definition is:
<PRE>name = "associated group"
id = 5
description = "The class string of the group that is associated "
              "with the events defined in this Event Generation "
              "group."
type = string ( &lt;size&gt; )
access = read-only
storage = common

value = "&lt;class string&gt;"
</PRE>

<P>
If a management application discovers an event generation group, it can
determine the associated group by issuing a DmiListFirstComponentCmd with
a class filter of EventGeneration|| and a keylist containing the value of
this attribute.
