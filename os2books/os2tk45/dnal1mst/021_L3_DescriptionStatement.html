<P>
The<B> description</B> statement is used within a definition to provide
information about the element being defined. The description statement can
be used within a component, group, or attribute definition, but you cannot
specify more than one description statement for a single definition.
<P>
The syntax for the description statement is:
<PRE>description = "description string"
</PRE>

<P>
<I>description string</I> is defined by the component developer.
<P>
The content of the description statement is usually used for display to
a user through a management application, such as the DMI browser. Users
can also change the value of this string by editing the MIF file directly.
