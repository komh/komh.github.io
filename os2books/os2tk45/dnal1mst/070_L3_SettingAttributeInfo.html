<P>
To enable concurrent access by multiple management applications, the DMI
allows more than one pass through a list of Set commands. The first pass
is a call to reserve the attributes. This reserve command tests a component
to verify that a set operation on a given attribute can occur and asks the
component instrumentation to validate a set operation without performing
the set operation. The component instrumentation must validate the parameters
of the call and reserve any resources that would be required if the set
command were issued.
<P>
A positive response from the reserve command indicates that the component
instrumentation has validated the parameters and reserved any resources
that might be required to perform the set operation. A negative response
from the command indicates that the component instrumentation is unable
to perform the set operation.
<P>
If all the attributes in the list returned successfully from the reserve
operation, the management application typically issues a Set command for
each attribute.
<P>
If a reserve fails, the management application might want to release each
of the attributes it previously reserved. Releasing attributes allows the
component instrumentation to deallocate any resources it had acquired. The
task of setting attributes back to their previous values is the responsibility
of the management application.
<P>
There are three Set commands:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DmiSetAttributeCmd<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Sets the value for a specified
attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DmiSetReserveAttributeCmd<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Reserves
a specified attribute for a subsequent set operation<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DmiSetReleaseAttributeCmd
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Releases a specified attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For a description of the DmiSetAttributeReq block used to issue these Set
commands, read <A HREF="111_L3_DmiSetAttributeReq.html">DmiSetAttributeReq
