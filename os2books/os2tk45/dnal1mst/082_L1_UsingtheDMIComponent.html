<H1>Using the DMI Component Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 82 -->
<P>
This chapter describes how a component communicates with the DMI through
the Component Interface (CI) and how component instrumentation registers
with the service layer and send indications.
<P>
Calls from the service layer through the CI use only attribute, group and
key identifiers for naming. By the time the component instrumentation is
reached, the service layer has resolved the component ID. Indications sent
from the component instrumentation through the CI also need the component
ID so that the service layer can identify the component instrumentation.

<P>
The mechanics of the communication from the service layer to the component
instrumentation are specific to the operating system environment. The entry
point function calls that the component instrumentation must respond to
are DmiCiInvoke() and DmiCiCancel().
<P>
The service layer is responsible for launching the component instrumentation,
if necessary, and for passing along the command blocks.
