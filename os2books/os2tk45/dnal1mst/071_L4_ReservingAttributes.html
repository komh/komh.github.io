<P>
Reserving an attribute verifies that the set operation is valid. This ensures
that a subsequent set operation will be successfully issued. However, it
is<I> not</I> a locking operation. A management application can never assume
exclusive control of a component.
<P>
The component instrumentation that receives the Reserve command is responsible
for testing the arguments to verify that the set operation can be performed.
The testing verifies that the arguments are within range and allocates and
reserves any resources that might be needed to ensures the success of a
subsequent set operation.
<P>
After a successful set operation, the component instrumentation automatically
releases any resources that it has reserved. The management application
does not need to explicitly issue a Release command after a set.
<P>
The component instrumentation requires that all Reserve commands be followed
by either Set or Release commands to perform the set operation or to release
the reserved resources. The failure of the management application to issue
either command is considered a catastrophic failure and is outside the scope
of the component instrumentation's responsibility to try to correct.
<P>
If a management application requests that multiple attributes be reserved
and one of the reservations fails, the service layer returns the attribute
where the command failed. It is the responsibility of the management application
to release any successfully reserved attributes.
