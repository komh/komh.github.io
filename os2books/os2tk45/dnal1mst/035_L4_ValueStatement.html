<H1>Value Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 35 -->
<P>
The value statement provides a value for the attribute being defined or
a means by which the value can be determined.
<P>
The syntax for the value statement is one of the following:
<PRE>value = v
value = "enumeration value"
value = * "name"
value = unsupported
value = unknown
</PRE>

<P>
The values specified in the value statement include:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
v<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> The value<I> v</I> is used for read-only attributes
whose values do not change or for read-write values that are managed by
the service layer rather than by component instrumentation. The value specified
in the statement must conform to the data type of the attribute. For example,
literal strings must be specified within double quotes. Write-only attributes
cannot specify a value of<I> v</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> "enumeration
value"<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> The value "enumeration value" can be either
a text string or integer value that references a previously specified enumeration
definition within the component or within this attribute definition. The
type statement for the attribute must be an enumeration definition, as described
in <A HREF="032_L4_TypeStatement.html">Type Statement</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> *
"name"<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> This value specifies the symbolic name of
the component instrumentation code that is used to read or write the value
for this attribute when a request is made to the service layer. The name
indicated by this value must have been previously defined in a path definition
within the component definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> unsupported<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> This
value is a reserved keyword and indicates to the service layer that the
attribute is not supported for this component.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> unknown
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>This value is a reserved keyword and indicates
to the service layer that the attribute is supported but its value is known.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The value statement is required unless you are defining a template for a
table, where it is optional. However, if you do provide a value within a
template, that value is used as the default value when populating the table.
If you do not specify a value for a template, no default value is used.
