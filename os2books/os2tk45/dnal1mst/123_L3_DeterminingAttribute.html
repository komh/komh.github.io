<H1>Determining Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 128 -->
<P>
Before you begin determining possible grouping arrangements for the attributes
in your component, be sure that you have considered all of the manageable
aspects of your component in as much detail as possible. Be sure to include
all of the items that can be configured or that can be changed, as well
as information that enables asset management, such as a product version
number or a serial number.
<P>
The ComponentID group (<A HREF="037_L3_ComponentIDGroup.html">ComponentID
Group</A>) is a good example of these kinds of attributes.
<P>
You can also examine existing MIF files of other components to get an idea
of what kinds of attributes are defined to enable a product for management
through the DMI.
