<H1>DMI Procedure Library (DMIAPI)</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
The DMI procedure library provided with the SystemView Agent package is
a C library that contains procedures for a specific operation system for
developing applications that use the DMI Management Interface and Component
Interface entry points. You can use the procedures in the library to simplify
the processes of installing components in the MIF database and invoking
the service layer's Component Interface. The procedures in the DMI procedure
library are used in the example programs provided with the SystemView Agent
program.
