<H1>Name Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
The<B> name</B> statement is used within a definition to assign a short
identifying string to the definition. This statement is required for all
definitions in the MIF file, and only one name statement is allowed for
each definition. The MIF does not require that name statements be unique,
with the exception of those used in enumeration and path definitions. The
name statements in these two cases must be unique among those specified
in other enumeration and path definitions in the component definition.
<P>
The syntax for the name statement is:
<PRE>name = "name string"
</PRE>

<P>
<I>name string</I> is defined by the component developer. The length of
the string must be less than 256 characters.
<P>
The content of the name statement is usually used for display to a user
through a management application, such as the DMI browser. Users can also
change the value of this string by editing the MIF file directly.
