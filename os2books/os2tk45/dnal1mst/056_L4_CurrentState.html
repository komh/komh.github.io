<P>
The current state attribute indicates the severity of the specific event
type represented by this row of the event state group.
<P>
The syntax of the current state definition is:
<PRE>name = "current state"
id = 4
description = "The current state of the Event type identified "
              "by Event Type attribute in this row."
type = start enum
          0x0004 = "OK"
          0x0008 = "Non-Critical"
          0x000A = "Critical"
          0x000C = "Non-Recoverable"
       end enum
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = "OK"
</PRE>

<P>
The enumeration defined in this attribute is a subset of the enumeration
defined in the event severity attribute in the event generation group definition.
