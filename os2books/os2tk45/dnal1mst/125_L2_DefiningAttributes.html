<H1>Defining Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 130 -->
<P>
After you determine the manageable aspects of your component and define
the groups you will use to organize the attributes, you are ready to define
the attributes according to the MIF. <A HREF="010_L1_UnderstandingtheMIF.html">Understanding
the MIF</A> provides a detailed description of the syntax and conventions
used by the MIF, including the different definitions used to define your
MIF file.
<P>
The attribute is the smallest piece of your component that can be defined
and identifies a discrete manageable aspect of the component. The way you
define an attribute affects not only how the attribute value is stored and
accessed but also how the component is managed. To ensure that management
of your component is as efficient as possible, consider these points when
defining the attributes in your component:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Access to an attribute should be determined by the
likelihood of its changing. If it is clear that an attribute value will
not change or should not be modified, define the attribute with read-only
access.
<P>
For those attributes that do change, determine whether the value should
be available to a management application. If so, read-write access is appropriate
for the attribute, but if not, specify write-only access for the attribute.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tables provide flexibility for defining and managing
attributes that require more than one value. As your component develops,
the tables you have defined can be expanded to accommodate any changes.

<P>
When defining key attributes to be used as indexes into a table, use as
many keys as necessary to provide management applications efficient and
flexible access to the data in the table. The attributes you specify as
keys should be appropriate to the component and not simply arbitrary indexing
values.
<P>
If you are developing a component that does not have instrumentation associated
with it, ensure that the order of the keys in the MIF file is sequential.
This maximizes performance of the service layer, particularly across SNMP.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The values for each row in a table, including the key value,
must be supplied either from the MIF database or by component instrumentation.
You cannot supply values from the database and from instrumentation for
the same row.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Do not add attributes specific to your component to
those defined for a standard group. If you alter the contents of a standard
group, management applications can no longer manage the group reliably.
Instead, use the standard group in your component and add another group
that contains your private attribute definitions.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use detailed description statements to provide as
much information about your attributes as possible. Information such as
minimum, maximum, and default values is also useful.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Designate how an attribute value is to be supplied
according to the stability and nature of the attribute. If the attribute
value is static, the value can be supplied by the MIF database. However,
if the attribute value is likely to change frequently, specify that the
value be supplied by component instrumentation, such as a runtime program
or a direct-interface program. This ensures that the value provided for
an attribute is current.
<P>
For example, ProductID and SerialNumber are likely candidates for database
attributes because their values are not likely to change. However, Available_Bytes_on_Hard_Drive
is an attribute that is appropriate for component instrumentation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
