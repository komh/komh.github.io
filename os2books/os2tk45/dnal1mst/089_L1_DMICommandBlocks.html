<H1>DMI Command Blocks</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->
<P>
The commands issued to the DMI by management applications and components
are composed of data structures called command blocks. A typical DMI command
contains the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A standard command block, such as the DmiMgmtCommand
block. This block appears first in the command block and provides a command
code that indicates the specific operation to perform and the composition
of the remainder of the command block.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One or more blocks pertaining to a specific command.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any data associated with the command-specific blocks.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This chapter describes the command blocks used with the DMI. There are three
types of DMI command blocks:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Common command blocks<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Management
Interface (MI) command blocks<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Component Interface (CI) command blocks<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Each command block described in this chapter has the following information
presented in tabular format:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Offset<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Indicates the location of the element in
the buffer. The offset is the number of octets from the start of the buffer.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Size<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Indicates the size
of the element in octets.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Type<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Indicates
the type of element.  Possible types include:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
INT<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> Integer<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>OFFSET<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> Offset to another element in the block
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>PTR<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> Pointer to a buffer<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>STRUCT<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> Command block structure<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>TIMESTAMP<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> Timestamp block<!-- lm: 0x2 16 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Variable
name<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Indicates the name of the element<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
