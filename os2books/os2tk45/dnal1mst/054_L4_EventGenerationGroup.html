<H1>Event Generation Group</H1><!-- entering slot 54 -->
<P>
This attribute contains the class string of the event generation group within
the component definition that defines the indication format for the related
event. The ComponentID of the component with which the event is associated
is specified in the header of the Indication data structure.
<P>
The syntax of the event-generation-group definition is:
<PRE>name = "event generation group class"
id = 2
description = "The Class String of the event generator group "
              "within the generating Component"
type = string (256)
access = read-only
storage = common
value = 0
</PRE>

<P>
For each row in the event state group, this attribute identifies the ID
of the event generation group that defines the event type represented by
the row. A management application can scan for state-based events in a system
by using a class filter of "|EventState|" to discover instances of the event
state group and then scanning the rows of the group for state-based events.

<P>
If you are adding rows to the event state group for proprietary state-based
events, specify the class string of the proprietary event generation group
as the value for this attribute in the additional rows.
