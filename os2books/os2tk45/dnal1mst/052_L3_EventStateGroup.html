<H1>Event State Group</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->
<P>
The event state group is a table that contains the current state of state-based
events within the component. The group definition has a key that acts as
a unique identifier for each row of the table. A row in the table holds
information about a unique event type that is generated from a given event
generation group in the component.
<P>
An example of the general structure of the event state group is:
<PRE>start group
   name = "Event State"
   class = "DMTF|Event State|001"
   id = nnn
   key = nnn
       (attribute definitions here)
end group
</PRE>

<P>
You can also maintain the current state information for proprietary state-based
events by adding more rows within this group that reference the proprietary
event generation group. Refer to <A HREF="054_L4_EventGenerationGroup.html">Event
Generation Group</A> for information on doing this using the event generation
group attribute in the event state group definition.
