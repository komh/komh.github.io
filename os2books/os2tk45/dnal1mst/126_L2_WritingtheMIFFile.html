<P>
You can write the MIF file with any editor you choose, as long as it is
a plain ASCII text file with no embedded formatting commands or control
characters. Although the order of group definitions in the MIF file does
not affect the way the file is interpreted by the service layer, the structure
of the MIF file should be logical and organized for easy maintenance and
expansion. Use white space, indentation, and comments to enhance the readability
of the file.
<P>
The conventions and syntax used by the Management Information Format are
described in detail in <A HREF="010_L1_UnderstandingtheMIF.html">Understanding
the MIF</A>.
<P>
Follow these general steps when writing the MIF file:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define your groups and specify which are standard
and which are private to the component. Use the ComponentID group as the
first group in the file.
<P>
If a group functions as a table template, specify a key value and an ID,
if appropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define any enumeration definitions that apply to the
component as a whole.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define the attributes for each group.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define any table definitions that refer to previously
defined templates, if appropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
