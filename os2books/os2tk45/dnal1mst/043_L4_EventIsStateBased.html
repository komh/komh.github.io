<P>
This attribute indicates whether the component that generates an event is
state-based. If the component is state-based, an event is generated whenever
the component's state changes or when any problem state is cleared. If the
component is not state-based, an event is generated for any condition of
interest that develops, but no event is generated when the condition clears.

<P>
This attribute is required in the event generation group.
<P>
The syntax of the event-is-state-based definition is:
<PRE>name = "event is state-based"
id = 3
description = "The value of this attribute determines "
              "whether the Event being reported is a "
              "state-based Event or not. If the value of "
              "this attribute is TRUE then the Event is state-"
              "based. Otherwise the Event is not state-based."
type = "BOOL"
access = read-only
storage = common

value = "False"
</PRE>

<P>
A value of True indicates that the event is state-based.
