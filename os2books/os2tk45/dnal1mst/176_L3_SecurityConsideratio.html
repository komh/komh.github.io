<H1>Security Considerations with Overlay Components</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->
<P>
Because overlay component instrumentation code runs as part of the service
layer and is executed with root privileges, these components must be installed
in the /usr/lpp/sva/overlay directory. You must have root privileges to
write to this directory.
<P>
Changing the privileges of the /usr/lpp/sva/overlay directory could allow
a non-root user to install a component that would then run with root privileges,
creating a potential security exposure. For this reason, it is important
that you ensure that the /usr/lpp/sva/overlay directory is only writeable
by those with root privileges.
