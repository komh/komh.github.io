<P>
The event severity attribute indicates the category of the event that has
been generated. This attribute is required in the event generation group.

<P>
The syntax of the event severity definition is:
<PRE>name = "event severity"
id = 2
description = "The severity of this event."
type =  start enumeration
           0x001 = "Monitor"
           0x002 = "Information"
           0x004 = "OK"
           0x008 = "Non-Critical"
           0x00A = "Critical"
           0x00C = "Non-Recoverable"
        end enumeration
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = 0
</PRE>

<P>
The enumeration list in this definition cannot be changed.
<P>
The events with a severity of Monitor and Information are used to provide
information about the event but do not indicate the state of the component
that generated the event. Severities of OK, Non-Critical, Critical, and
Non-Recoverable, however, are state-based.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Monitor<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL> Used for periodic events generated by transaction-oriented
components.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Information<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL> Used
to indicate change that is not considered a problem. Information events
are not periodic or expected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> OK<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL> Used
to indicate that the component has entered the normal state, either for
the first time (on initialization, for example) or after a problem state
(Non-Critical, Critical, Non-Recoverable) has cleared.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Non-Critical
<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL>Used to indicate that a problem needs to be corrected,
although no time period for correction is associated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Critical
<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL>Used to indicate that a problem needs to be corrected
within a specific time period.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Non-Recoverable<!-- lm: 0x12 19 -->
<UL> Used
to indicate that a problem needs to be corrected immediately. Non-Recoverable
events indicate serious failure situations.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
