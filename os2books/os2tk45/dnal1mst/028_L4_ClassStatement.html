<H1>Class Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 28 -->
<P>
The class statement is used within a group definition to identify the developer
of the group and the version information that applies to the group. All
groups that share the same value for the class statement must also share
the same attribute definitions, including the same type, access, storage,
and ID statements. The name, description, and value statements on the attribute
definitions can vary. Identical class strings indicate identical group definitions.
The conformance provided by the class statement enables management applications
to determine the semantics of the group's attributes. Only one class statement
is allowed for each group definition.
<P>
The syntax of the class statement is:
<PRE>class = "class string"
</PRE>

<P>
<I>class string</I> generally takes the following form:
<PRE>"defining body|specific name|version"
</PRE>

<P>
In this convention,<I> defining body</I> is the name of the organization,
<I>specific name</I> identifies the contents of the group, and<I> version
</I>identifies the version of the group definition. Spaces are significant
in this convention, so that "DMTF|ComponentID|1.0" is not interpreted as
being the same as "DMTF | ComponentID | 1.0".
<P>
Although the MIF does not require that any particular convention be used
when defining the class statement, any class statements that do not follow
this convention generate a warning message during the installation of the
MIF file. Because applications and service layers might use this convention
when obtaining information with the List Component command, component developers
are encouraged to use this convention.
<P>
If you are developing a component that does not use the entire set of attributes
defined by a class, specify the unsupported keyword in the definitions for
the unused attributes. Read <A HREF="035_L4_ValueStatement.html">Value Statement
</A>for more information about using this keyword.
