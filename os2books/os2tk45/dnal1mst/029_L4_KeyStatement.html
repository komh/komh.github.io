<H1>Key Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
When the attributes in a group define a row in a table, the group must contain
a key statement that identifies the attribute ID used as the index into
the table. Attributes that function as keys can be of any data type and
identify no more than one instance of a group. Each instance of a group
represents a row of a table. Only one key statement is allowed for each
group definition.
<P>
The syntax of the class statement is:
<PRE>key = n[,m]
</PRE>

<P>
<I>n</I> is the ID of the attribute that functions as the key for the table.
If you use more than one attribute to index a table, specify the values
in the key statement as integers separated by commas. When a management
application sends a request or when component instrumentation sends a response
regarding information in a table, the key values must be sent in the same
order as they are listed in the key statement.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you are using the DMI subagent to translate MIF information
into SNMP MIB information, do not specify an attribute with a data type
of integer64 (int64) or counter64 as a key. The DMI subagent does not support
64-bit keys.
