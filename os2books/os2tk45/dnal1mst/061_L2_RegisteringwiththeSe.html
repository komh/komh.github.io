<H1>Registering with the Service Layer</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
Before initiating any management activity through the DMI, a management
application must register with the service layer. The registration process
enables the service layer to provide services for the management application,
such as forwarding indications from components in the system.
<P>
The following registration commands are described in the command blocks
chapter, according to their command block structure:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DmiRegisterMgmtReq (<A HREF="099_L3_DmiRegisterMgmtReq.html">DmiRegisterMgmtReq
Command Block</A>)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DmiRegisterCnf (<A HREF="100_L3_DmiRegisterCnf.html">DmiRegisterCnf
Command Block</A>)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Because the service layer maintains the entry points for a management application
until the application unregisters, the application cannot provide different
entry points for different commands. However, if for some reason a management
application needs to use multiple entry points to the service layer, the
application can do one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Register a dispatch routine as its entry point and
then manually dispatch reports to the appropriate code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Register with the service layer more than once, giving
different entry points for each registration. For each registration, the
service layer assigns a new management handle, so the appropriate handle
can be used when issuing a command. Because each registration adds processing
overhead to the service layer, this approach should be used only when the
first method is not practical.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to the management application's entry points, the service layer
must keep the value of the osLanguage string in the command block. This
value identifies the language and character set that the service layer uses
when sending indications to the management application.
