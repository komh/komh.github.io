<P>
Component instrumentation code can register with the service layer. Registration
is desirable when the component instrumentation code is already running,
such as management code associated with a running device driver. Registering
management entry points within the running code is called registering the
direct interface. The direct interface is also useful when the time required
to locate and load an executable file and set up and terminate a process
would be excessive.
<P>
Component instrumentation that has registered a direct interface causes
the service layer to override its current access mechanism for the registered
attributes. Instead of manipulating the data in the MIF database or invoking
programs, the service layer calls the entry point provided in the registration
call. When the component unregisters, the service layer returns to its usual
method  of processing requests for the data, as defined in the MIF file.
In this way, component instrumentation can temporarily interrupt normal
processing to perform some special function. Note that registering attributes
through the direct interface overrides attributes that are already being
served through the direct interface.

The DmiRegisterCiInd block can be used:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To register a callable interface for components that
have resident instrumentation code<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To get the version of the service layer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

instrumentation, read <A HREF="117_L3_DmiRegisterCiInd.html">DmiRegisterCiInd

<P>
To unregister component instrumentation, the DmiUnregisterCiInd block is
issued to the service layer. For a description of the DmiUnregisterCiInd
block issued when unregistering instrumentation, read <A HREF="119_L3_DmiUnregisterCiInd.html">DmiUnregisterCiInd
Command Block</A>.
