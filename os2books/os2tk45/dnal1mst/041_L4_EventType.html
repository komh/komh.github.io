<P>
The event type attribute indicates the reason that the event was generated.
This attribute is required in the event generation group.
<P>
The syntax of the event type definition is:
<PRE>name = "event type"
id = 1
description = "The type of event that has occurred."
type = &lt;enumeration&gt;
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = 0
</PRE>

<P>
The enumeration list is unique to the event generation group being defined
and is not specified in this example.
