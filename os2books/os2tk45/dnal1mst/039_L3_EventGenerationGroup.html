<H1>Event Generation Group</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
The event generation group definition serves as a template that a management
application can use to associate values received in the Indication buffer
with enumeration display strings. Although values are specified in the group
definition to ensure proper processing of the MIF file, the management application
accesses the appropriate values directly from the Indication buffer.
<P>
The general structure of the event generation group is:
<PRE>start group
   name = "Event Generation"
   class = "EventGeneration|&lt;specific name&gt;|001"
   id = nnn
   key = nnn[,mmm]...
       (attribute definitions here)
end group
</PRE>

<P>
The string defined in the class statement is unique for each event generation
group and is specified in the following format:
<PRE>&lt;defining-body&gt;^^&lt;specific-name-of-associated-group&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The contents of the<I> specific-name-of-associated-group</I>field indicates
the name of the group to which the events defined in the event generation
group correspond.
<P>
Component developers can define additional attributes to a standard event
generation group by using a<I> proprietary-extension</I> field that is appended
to the class statement. The format for the class statement in this case
is:
<PRE>&lt;defining-body&gt;^^&lt;specific-name-of-assoc-grp&gt;^^&lt;proprietary-extension&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
When specifying a proprietary extension, it is recommended that you use
the complete, registered name of your corporate entity. This ensures that
the<I> specific-name</I> field in the class statement is unique.
<P>
When defining multiple event generation groups for a single associated group,
place the event generation groups immediately after the associated group
in the MIF file and use sequential IDs.
