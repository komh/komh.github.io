<P>
The event system attribute provides information about the functional system
of the product that generated the event. A management application can use
the values of this attribute and the event subsystem attribute (<A HREF="047_L4_EventSubsystem.html">Event
Subsystem</A>) to construct a simple message describing the event.
<P>
This attribute is required in the event generation group.
<P>
The syntax of the event system definition is:
<PRE>name = "event system"
id = 6
description = "The major functional aspect of the product "
              "causing the fault."
type = &lt;enumeration&gt;
access = read-only
storage = specific

value = 0
</PRE>

<P>
The enumeration list is unique to the event generation group being defined
and is not specified in this example.
