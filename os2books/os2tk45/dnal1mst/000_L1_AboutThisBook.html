<P>
This book is designed as a programmer's guide for the IBM SystemView Agent
Version 1 program (hereafter referred to as SystemView Agent). SystemView
Agent provides access to system components that have been defined according
to the Desktop Management Interface (DMI) standard by acting as an SNMP
agent. These components can be hardware or software in the system that have
been defined in the Management Information Format (MIF). Although the DMI
itself is protocol-independent, SystemView Agent can detect any DMI-enabled
components in the system and translate the MIF information into SNMP management
information bases (MIBs).
<P>
This book contains information for versions of the SystemView Agent program
that run in the following environments:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

is pertinent to all operating systems that the SystemView Agent program
supports.
