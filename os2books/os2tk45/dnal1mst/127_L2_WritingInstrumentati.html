<H1>Writing Instrumentation Code</H1><!-- entering slot 132 -->
<P>
When a component receives a request from the service layer for an attribute's
value, the instrumentation code for the component is invoked to retrieve
the value. By providing instrumentation for your component, you ensure that
the information that is accessed by management applications is both current
and accurate. Without instrumentation, you run the risk of allowing the
information in the MIF file to become outdated.
<P>
You can provide instrumentation for your component in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An overlay program<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A direct-interface program<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
