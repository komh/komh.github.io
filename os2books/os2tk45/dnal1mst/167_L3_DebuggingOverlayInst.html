<H1>Debugging Overlay Instrumentation</H1><!-- entering slot 172 -->
<P>
Overlay component instrumentation can be difficult to debug because of its
transitory nature. To facilitate this kind of debugging, you can use a debug
option when running the service layer.
<P>
Before you use this option, you must stop the service layer, if it's already
running. If you start the service layer automatically when your system starts,
do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Comment out the RUN= line in your CONFIG.SYS file
that starts the DMISL.EXE program.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Restart your system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To start the service layer with the debug option, enter the following command
from an OS/2 command prompt:
<PRE>DMISL DEBUG</PRE>

<P>
If the subdirectory containing the service layer executable file is not
in your PATH statement, enter the appropriate drive and path as part of
the command.
<P>
When the service layer is loaded, a debug address is displayed. When you
set a breakpoint at this address, execution stops just before the DmiCiInvoke()
function call is issued. At this point the overlay component DLL is already
loaded, and you can specify breakpoints in the instrumentation wherever
you need them.
