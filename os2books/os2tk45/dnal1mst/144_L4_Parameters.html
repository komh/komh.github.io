<H1>Parameters</H1><!-- entering slot 149 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
iFileCount<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> The number of files within the dmiFileList
structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> dmiLibFileList<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> An
array of structures containing the types and locations of the files to install.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>pDmiDir<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> A DMI_STRING pointer
to an operating system definition for the DMIDIR environment variable. If
this field is NIL, the library uses the system definition. When this field
is specified, the library uses this path name in place of the system definition.

<P>
This parameter is ignored by the OS/2 implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> iDefineDmiDir
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>A Boolean value (for which non-zero is true) that
directs the library to modify the system startup file to include a definition
for the DMIDIR environment variable.
<P>
If pDmiDir is not NIL, DMIAPI.LIB uses the value of that field in the modified
system startup file.
<P>
If pDmiDir is NIL, DMIAPI.LIB uses the current value of the DMIDIR environment
variable. If DMIDIR is not defined, DMIAPI.LIB attempts to query the service
layer for the path name of the DMI directory. If DMIAPI.LIB is unable to
determine the path name of the DMI directory, DmiInstall() terminates with
an error. To resolve this condition, the calling program must re-issue the
DmiInstall() command, with the pDmiDir parameter defined.
<P>
If the system startup file already had a definition for DMIDIR, then that
definition will be removed, and the new definition will be added.
<P>
This parameter is ignored by the OS/2 implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> StatusCall
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>A callback entry point that the service layer calls
with the MIF compiler messages.
<P>
The Component Installation Status window in the DMI browser is an example
of how you can use this parameter to display messages.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
