<H1>What is the Desktop Management Interface?</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) comprises a set of interfaces and
a service layer that mediate between management applications and components
residing in a system. The DMI is a free-standing interface that is not tied
to any particular operating system or management protocol.
<P>
In the context of the DMI, a<I> component</I> is a physical or logical element
of a system, such as a piece of hardware or software. The SystemView Agent
program can access information for components that you have defined for
your system or for components that are predefined by other products. The
program code that manages the component directly is referred to as the<I> component
instrumentation</I>.
<P>
Information about a component is defined in a language that is called the
Management Information Format (MIF). The MIF file for a component describes
all aspects of that component that can be managed by an application. The
MIF files for the components in a system are kept in a MIF database, where
they can be accessed through the DMI.
<P>
Elements of the DMI describes the elements that make up the DMI. ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

<P>
When a new component is introduced to the system, the component installs
the component MIF in the MIF database and notifies the service layer that
the component is available. The component then notifies any registered management
applications of its presence by sending an unsolicited notification, or
<I>event</I>, to the service layer. The service layer forwards the event
to the appropriate management applications in the form of an<I> indication</I>.

<P>
If a component does have any instrumentation associated with it, the MIF
file for the component is composed of static information.
<P>
If a component is using instrumentation to provide access to its information,
the instrumentation can be one of the following types of programs:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Overlay<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Loaded only when the service layer receives
a request for information. After the request is satisfied, the overlay program
is unloaded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Direct-interface<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Runs
continuously as a separate process. When the service layer receives a request,
it passes control temporarily to the direct-interface program, which retrieves
the information and passes it back to the service layer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If a management application wants to display or change information for a
component, the application registers with the service layer. After registration,
the management application can access component information with Get, Set,
and List commands. Get and Set commands are used to read and write MIF attributes
that pertain to the manageable elements of a component.
<P>
The service layer receives requests from the management application through
the MI and forwards them to the component instrumentation through the CI.
When responses come back to the service layer from the component, the service
layer passes them back to the management application through the MI. By
using the DMI to transfer information:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The management application does not need to understand
the mechanism by which instrumentation gathers component information<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The instrumentation does not need to understand the
component protocol used by the management application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
