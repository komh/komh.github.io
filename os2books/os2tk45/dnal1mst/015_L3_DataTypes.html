<H1>Data Types</H1><!-- entering slot 15 -->
<P>
The following data types are supported by the MIF:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
integer (or int)<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> A 32-bit signed integer with no
known semantics<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> integer64 (or int64)<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> A
64-bit signed integer with no known semantics<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> gauge
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>A 32-bit unsigned integer that can increase or
decrease. When a gauge reaches its maximum value (2[32]-1), it continues
to report the maximum value until the value decreases below the maximum.
The speedometer of an automobile is an example of a gauge.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> counter
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>A 32-bit unsigned integer that never decreases.
A counter increases to its maximum value (2[32]-1 or 2[64]-1) and reverts
to zero when it reaches its maximum value. The odometer of an automobile
is an example of a counter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> counter64<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> A
64-bit unsigned integer that never decreases. A counter increases to its
maximum value (2[32]-1 or 2[64]-1) and reverts to zero when it reaches its
maximum value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> string(<I>n</I>) or displaystring(<I>n</I>)
<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL>A displayable string of<I> n</I> octets. For ISO
8859-1 implementations, 1 octet per character; for Unicode implementations,
2 octets per character.
<P>
The value<I> n</I> represents the maximum number of octets in the string,
although the actual number of octets in use might be shorter than this maximum
value. The length of the string is stored in the first four octets, which
are not included in the value<I> n</I>. You do not need to zero-terminate
the string as you do in the C and C++ programming languages. The length
of the string represents the number of octets in the string, not the number
of characters.
<P>
The maximum value of<I> n</I> that the service layer can display is 508.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>octetstring(<I>n</I>)<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> A
string of<I> n</I> octets that might or might not be displayable.
<P>
The value<I> n</I> represents the maximum number of octets in the string,
although the actual number of octets in use might be shorter than this maximum
value. The length of the string is stored in the first four octets, which
are not included in the value<I> n</I>. You do not need to zero-terminate
the string as you do in the C and C++ programming languages. The length
of the string represents the number of octets in the string, not the number
of characters.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> date<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> A 28-octet
displayable string.
<P>
Dates are defined according to the following format:
<PRE>yyyymmddHHMMSS.uuuuuu+ooo
</PRE>

<P>
Where:<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<P>
yyyy<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> The year<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> mm<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> The
number of the month<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> dd<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> The
number of the day of the month<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> HHMMSS<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL> The
hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> uuuuuu
<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL>The number of microseconds<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> ooo
<!-- lm: 0x12 36 -->
<UL>The offset from universal time, coordinated (UTC)
in minutes. If east of UTC, the number is preceded by a plus (+) sign, if
west of UTC, the number is preceded by a minus (-) sign,<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
</UL> While
the date value occupies only 25 octets, the date is stored as a 28-octet
field to account for memory alignment. The last three octets are zeroes
(/0).
<P>
For example, Wednesday, May 25, 1994, at 1:30:15 PM EDT would be represented
as:
<PRE>19940525133015.000000-300
</PRE>

<P>
If necessary, values must be padded with leading zeroes to conform to the
specified format, as in<I> 05</I> being used to represent the month of May.
If a value is not supplied for a field, each character in the field must
be replaced with an asterisk (*).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
