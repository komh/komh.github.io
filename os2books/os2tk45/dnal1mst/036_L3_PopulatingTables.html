<P>
In the MIF, a table is composed of an array of group instances. Each instance
of a group is a row in the table. Defining a table can be done in one of
two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->By specifying a key statement on a group definition.
In this case, the values of the attributes within each row of the table
are provided by the component instrumentation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->By specifying the table's values within the MIF file
itself.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The table definition actually identifies the data in the table rather than
how the data is stored or changed. When you populate a table with a table
definition, you identify a previous group definition in the component to
be used as a template for the table.
<P>
The syntax for the table definition is:
<PRE>start table      name = "table name"
      id = nnn
      class = "class string"

      { v1[,v2...] }
      [ { vn[, vm...] }
end table
</PRE>

<P>
The name statement is required for identification. The value of the ID statement
must be unique across all other group and table definitions in the component.
The class statement identifies the previous group definition that is being
used as the template for this table.
<P>
For each row in the table, the values are specified between braces and conform
to the format described by the value statement (<A HREF="035_L4_ValueStatement.html">Value
Statement</A>). The values are separated by commas and listed from left
to right according to the attribute IDs that correspond to the values. The
value of the attribute with the lowest ID is listed first. If a value in
the list is omitted, the default value for the corresponding attribute is
used if a default value is defined in the template. If no default value
is defined, specify a value in the table definition. A row with too few
commas is treated as a row with the trailing number of requisite commas,
and the values specified in the template are used for the remaining attributes
in the row.
<P>
A row with too few commas generates an error message from the DMI browser.

<P>
Sample Table Definition provides an example of how you can use a table definition
to specify attribute values.

<PRE>
    start table
        name = "sample table"
        id = 2
        class = "group2 class"
        {7,,,,,,,,,}
        {8,8,8,8,6678,"row 8","octet","20011024123515.000000-300",543,8}
        {9,-99,9,9,6767,"row 9","octet","99999999999.999999-999",333,20}
    end table

</PRE>

<P>
When populating rows within a table, you must provide unique values for
the combination of attributes that make up the key. If the service layer
is managing a MIF file and the MIF file does not provide unique keys, the
service layer rejects the MIF file. As an example, consider a group definition
acting as a template, with two keys specified as<I> first name</I> and<I> last
name</I>. If the table is populated by two rows of attributes, it is acceptable
for the values of<I> last name</I> to be the same, as long as the values
for<I> first name</I> are different. In other words, the values "John Smith"
and "Paul Smith" are acceptable instances of the two keys, but "John Smith"
and "John Smith" are not.
<P>
A table definition must be defined after the group definition to which it
refers. You can specify the same template for multiple table definitions,
as long as each table definition has a different ID.
