<H1>Getting Attribute Information by Row</H1><!-- entering slot 73 -->
<P>
Get Row commands request the values of all the attributes in a particular
group. Because groups can be a scalar set of attributes or can be arranged
as tables-arrays of sets of attributes-it is more convenient to consider
them as rows. Groups used as tables include keys to specify the desired
instance (or row) of the group.
<P>
There are three Get Row commands:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DmiGetRowCmd<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> Requests the values of attributes
from a specific group or specific row of a table.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DmiGetFirstRowCmd
<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL>Requests the values of the attributes in the first
row of a table. This is the same as DmiGetRowCmd for non-tabular groups.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>DmiGetNextRowCmd<!-- lm: 0x11 16 -->
<UL> Requests
the values of the attributes of the row after the row whose key is passed
in the command block.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For a description of the DmiGetRowReq block used to issue these Set commands,
read <A HREF="112_L3_DmiGetRowReq.html">DmiGetRowReq Command Block</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
Note for Component Developers Note that the command can be asking for key
values or for attribute values. To determine which, the component instrumentation
must compare the iGroupKeyCount field of DmiGetRowReq to the iGroupKeyCount
field of DmiGetRowCnf. If the key count in the confirm block is less than
the key count of the request block, the service layer is requesting that
the next key value be returned.
<P>
The key value to return for the DmiGetFirstRowCmd command is the value of
the next key attribute in the first row of the table. For the DmiGetNextRowCmd
command, the key values in the DmiGetRowReq structure should be inspected
to determine the current row. Then the value in the succeeding row should
be returned.
<P>
The DmiGetRowCnf structure is always built by the service layer, and the
value of oGroupKeyList specifies the start of DmiGroupKeyData structures.
The pCnfBuf member of DmiCiCommand points to the position in the confirm
buffer where the key value should be placed. The value of iGroupKeyCount
should be incremented, but the iCnfCount member of the DmiMgmtCommand should
not.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
