<H1>Removing a Component</H1><!-- entering slot 84 -->
<P>
Removing a component from the MIF database effectively removes the component
from further participation in the management system. In the DMI, removing
a component is called<I> uninstalling</I>.
<P>
Removing a component from the MIF database does not mean the component is
not present in the computer system. The component is still in the system,
but the management system is not aware of it.
<P>
To remove a component from the MIF database, the component instrumentation
fills out a DmiCiUninstallData block and sends it to the service layer with
the DmiInvoke() function call.
<P>
For a description of the DmiCiUninstallData block issued when installing
a component, read <A HREF="116_L3_DmiCiUninstallData.html">DmiCiUninstallData
Command Block</A>.
<P>
Upon successful removal, the service layer sends an indication to every
management application that is currently registered with it. The value of
iIndicationType in the DmiIndicate block is 3, and the indication data is
a DmiListComponentCnf block.
