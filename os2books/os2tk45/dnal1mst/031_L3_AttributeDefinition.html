<P>
An attribute is a piece of data related to a component. You organize your
attributes by defining them within one or more group definitions. Each group
in the component must have at least one attribute definition, although many
attribute definitions can appear within a single group definition.
<P>
The syntax of the attribute definition is:
<PRE>start attribute
      name = "attribute name"
      id = nnn
      [description = "description string"]
      type = datatype
      [access = method]
      [storage = storage type]
      [value = v | * "name" | "enumeration string"]
end attribute
</PRE>

<P>
The ID statement is required for the attribute definition and must have
a value that is unique among all other attribute definitions within the
same group.
