<H1>WinWaitForShell - Usage</H1><!-- entering slot 253 -->
<P>
WinWaitForShell is used by an application when it needs to wait for the
Workplace Shell to be available in order for the application to continue.
 The application can use WinWaitForShell to wait for the Workplace Shell
to be ready to start receiving the create requests.  By using the optional
query bit, it can check on those conditions without waiting on them.
<P>
For example, the application might be started in STARTUP.CMD, and yet it
wants to create objects on the Workplace Shell.
<P>
It can wait on one of three events:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The desktop object has been created.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The desktop object has been opened.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The desktop object is fully populated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
