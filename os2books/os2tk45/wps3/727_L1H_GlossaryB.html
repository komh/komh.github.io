<B>B‚zier curve</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>(1) A mathematical technique
of specifying smooth continuous lines and surfaces, which require a starting
point and a finishing point with several intermediate points that influence
or control the path of the linking curve. Named after Dr. P. B‚zier. (2)
(D of C) In the AIX Graphics Library, a cubic spline approximation to a
set of four control points that passes through the first and fourth control
points and that has a continuous slope where two spline segments meet. Named
after Dr. P. B‚zier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> background</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>(1)
In multiprogramming, the conditions under which low-priority programs are
executed. Contrast with<I> foreground</I>. (2) An active session that is
not currently displayed on the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> background
color</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>The color in which the background of
a graphic primitive is drawn.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> background mix
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>An attribute that determines how the background
of a graphic primitive is combined with the existing color of the graphics
presentation space. Contrast with<I> mix</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> background
program</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>In multiprogramming, a program that
executes with a low priority. Contrast with<I> foreground program</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> bit
map</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A representation in memory of the data
displayed on an APA device, usually the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> block
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>(1) A string of data elements recorded or transmitted
as a unit. The elements may be characters, words, or logical records. (T)  
(2) To record data in a block. (3) A collection of contiguous records recorded
as a unit. Blocks are separated by interblock gaps and each block may contain
one or more records. (A)  <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> block device</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A
storage device that performs I/O operations on blocks of data called<I> sectors</I>.
Data on block devices can be randomly accessed. Block devices are designated
by a drive letter (for example,<B> C:</B>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> blocking
mode</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A condition set by an application that
determines when its threads might block. For example, an application might
set the Pipemode parameter for the DosCreateNPipe function so that its threads
perform I/O operations to the named pipe block when no data is available.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>border</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A visual
indication (for example, a separator line or a background color) of the
boundaries of a window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> boundary determination
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>An operation used to compute the size of the
smallest rectangle that encloses a graphics object on the screen.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> breakpoint
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>(1) A point in a computer program where execution
may be halted. A breakpoint is usually at the beginning of an instruction
where halts, caused by external intervention, are convenient for resuming
execution. (T)   (2) A place in a program, specified by a command or a condition,
where the system halts execution and gives control to the workstation user
or to a specified program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> broken pipe</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>When
all of the handles that access one end of a pipe have been closed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> bucket
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>One or more fields in which the result of an
operation is kept.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> buffer</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>(1)
A portion of storage used to hold input or output data temporarily. (2)
To allocate and schedule the use of buffers. (A)  <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> button
</B> -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>A mechanism used to request or initiate an
action.<!-- entering slot 731 --> See also<I> barrel buttons</I>,<I> bezel
buttons</I>,<I> mouse button</I>,<I> push button</I>, and<I> radio button</I>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>byte pipe</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Pipes
that handle data as byte streams. All unnamed pipes are byte pipes. Named
pipes can be byte pipes or message pipes. See<I> byte stream</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> byte
stream</B>  -<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Data that consists of an unbroken stream
of bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
