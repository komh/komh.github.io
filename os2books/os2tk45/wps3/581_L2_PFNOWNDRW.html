Pointer to an owner-draw function for a Details View field.
<P>
This function would be used if you wanted to draw the contents of the Details
View field yourself, for example, as a graphic image or to use custom formatting.

<P>
This function is called each time the field is painted.
<PRE>typedef FNOWNDRW *PFNOWNDRW;
</PRE>

<P>
The first argument (<A HREF="491_L2_HWND.html">HWND</A>) is the handle of
the Details View field-window being painted. The second argument (<A HREF="624_L2_PVOID.html">PVOID</A>)
is a pointer to an <A HREF="539_L2_OWNERITEM.html">OWNERITEM</A> data structure.
The third argument (<A HREF="624_L2_PVOID.html">PVOID</A>) is a pointer
to the Comparison value to draw (this argument is NULL except when this
function is painting its value into the Include Criteria Dialog (in the
Settings notebook), in which case it points to a string containing a comparision
value. The function returns a <A HREF="262_L2_BOOL.html">BOOL</A> value
of TRUE if the field was owner-drawn or FALSE if the container control should
do default painting.
<P>
In the header file, this is a two-part definition as shown below:
<PRE>typedef BOOL (EXPENTRY FNOWNDRW)(HWND, PVOID, PVOID);
typedef FNOWNDRW *<B>PFNOWNDRW</B>;
