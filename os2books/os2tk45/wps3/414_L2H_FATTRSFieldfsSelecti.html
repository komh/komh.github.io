<P>
Flags causing the following features to be simulated by the system.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If an italic flag is applied to a font that is itself defined
as italic, the font is slanted further by italic simulation.
<P>
Underscore or strikeout lines are drawn using the appropriate attributes
(for example, color) from the character bundle (see the <A HREF="272_L2_CHARBUNDLE.html">CHARBUNDLE
</A>datatype), not the line bundle (see <A HREF="504_L2_LINEBUNDLE.html">LINEBUNDLE</A>).
The width of the line, and the vertical position of the line in font space,
are determined by the font. Horizontally, the line starts from a point in
font space directly above or below the start point of each character, and
extends to a point directly above or below the escapement point for that
character.
<P>
For this purpose, the start and escapement points are those applicable to
left-to-right or right-to-left character directions (see GpiSetCharDirection
in<I> Graphics Programming Interface Programming Reference</I>), even if
the string is currently being drawn in a top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top
direction.
<P>
For left-to-right or right-to-left directions, any white space generated
by the character extra and character break extra attributes (see GpiSetCharExtra
and GpiSetCharBreakExtra in<I> Graphics Programming Interface Programming
Reference</I>), as well as increments provided by the vector of increments
on GpiCharStringPos and GpiCharStringPosAt, are also underlined/overstruck,
so that in these cases the line is continuous for the string.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<UL>Use an outline font with hollow characters. If this
flag is not set, outline font characters are filled. Setting this flag normally
gives better performance, and for sufficiently small characters (depending
on device resolution) there may be little visual difference.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
