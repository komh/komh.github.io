<H1>WinNotebookButtonFromID - Usage</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
Given the HWND of the dialog of the properties page, the ID of the button,
and the button of the properties page (for example, Undo, Default, or Help),
WinNotebookButtonFromID, returns the HWND for that button.  This is used
with the buttons of the BS_NOTEBOOKBUTTON style.  Ownership of buttons of
this style is changed from the dialog to the notebook after the dialog is
loaded.
