<UL> Window
attributes.
<P>
Consists of container window attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->Specify one of the following container views, which
determine the presentation format of items in a container:<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>
<P>
CV_ICON<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> In the icon view, the container items are
represented as icon/text or bit-map/text pairs, with text beneath the icons
or bit maps. This is the default view. This view can be combined with the
CV_MINI style bit by using an OR operator (|).<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CV_NAME
<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL>In the name view, the container items are represented
as icon/text or bit-map/text pairs, with text to the right of the icons
or bit maps. This view can be combined with the CV_MINI and CV_FLOW style
bits by using OR operators (|).<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CV_TEXT<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> In
the text view, the container items are displayed as a list of text strings.
This view can be combined with the CV_FLOW style bit by using an OR operator
(|).<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CV_TREE<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> In the tree
view, the container items are represented in a hierarchical manner. The
tree view has three forms, which are defined in the following list. If you
specify CV_TREE by itself, the tree icon view is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->Tree icon view
<P>
The tree icon view is specified by using a logical OR operator to combine
the tree view with the icon view (CV_TREE | CV_ICON). Container items in
this view are represented as icon/text pairs or bit-map/text pairs, with
text to the right of the icons or bit maps. Also, a collapsed or expanded
icon or bit map is displayed to the left of parent items. If this icon or
bit map is a<I> collapsed</I> icon or bit map, selecting it will cause the
parent item to be expanded so that its child items are displayed below it.
If this icon or bit map is an<I> expanded</I> icon or bit map, selecting
it will cause the parent's child items to be removed from the display. The
default collapsed and expanded bit maps provided by the container use a
plus sign (+) and a minus sign (-), respectively, to indicate that items
can be added to or subtracted from the display.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->Tree name view
<P>
The tree name view is specified by using a logical OR operator to combine
the tree view with the name view (CV_TREE | CV_NAME). Container items in
this view are displayed as either icon/text pairs or bit-map/text pairs,
with text to the right of the icons or bit maps. However, the indicator
that represents whether an item can be collapsed or expanded, such as a
plus or minus sign, is included in the icon or bit map that represents that
item, not in a separate icon or bit map as in the tree icon and tree text
views. The container control does not provide default collapsed and expanded
bit maps for the tree name view.<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->Tree text view
<P>
The tree text view is specified by using a logical OR operator to combine
the tree view with the text view (CV_TREE | CV_TEXT). Container items in
this view are displayed as a list of text strings. As in the tree icon view,
a collapsed or expanded icon or bit map is displayed to the left of parent
items.<!-- lm: 0x2 17 --><!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CV_DETAIL<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> In
the details view, the container items are presented in columns. Each column
can contain icons or bit maps, text, numbers, dates, or times.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>Specify
one or both of the following view styles by using an OR operator (|) to
combine them with the specified view. These view styles are optional.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<P>
CV_MINI<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Produces a mini-icon whose size is based
on the Presentation Manager (PM) SV_CYMENU system value to produce a device-dependent
mini-icon.
<P>
The CV_MINI view style bit is ignored when:<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->The text view (CV_TEXT), tree view (CV_TREE), or
details view (CV_DETAIL) are displayed<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->The CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style bit is specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 17 -->
</UL> If
this style bit is not specified and the icon view (CV_ICON) or name view
(CV_NAME) is used, the default, regular-sized icon is used. The size of
regular-sized icons is based on the value in the<I> slBitmapOrIcon</I> field
of the CNRINFO data structure. If this field is equal to 0, the PM SV_CXICON
and SV_CYICON system values for width and height, respectively, are used.
Icon sizes are consistent with PM-defined icon sizes for all devices.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CV_FLOW
<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL>Dynamically arranges container items in columns
in the name and text views. These are called flowed name and flowed text
views. If this style bit is set for the name view (CV_NAME) or text view
(CV_TEXT), the container items are placed in a single column until the bottom
of the client area is reached. The next container item is placed in the
adjacent column to the right of the filled column. This process is repeated
until all of the container items are positioned in the container. The width
of each column is determined by the longest text string in that column.
The size of the window determines the depth of the client area.
<P>
If this style bit is not specified, the default condition for the name and
text views is to vertically fill the container in a single column without
flowing the container items. If this style bit is set for the icon view
(CV_ICON) or details view (CV_DETAIL), it is ignored.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>Specify
either of the following to indicate whether the container will display icons
or bit maps:<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<P>
CA_DRAWICON<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Icons are used for the icon, name,
tree, or details views. This is the default. This container attribute should
be used with the<I> hptrIcon</I> and<I> hptrMiniIcon</I> fields of the <A HREF="625_L2_RECORDCORE.html">RECORDCORE
</A>data structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CA_DRAWBITMAP<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Bit
maps are used for the icon, name, tree, or details views. This container
attribute can be used with the<I> hbmBitmap</I> and<I> hbmMiniBitmap</I> fields
of the <A HREF="625_L2_RECORDCORE.html">RECORDCORE</A> data structure.

</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<UL>Specify
one of the following attributes to provide target emphasis for the name,
text, and details views. If neither ordered nor mixed target emphasis is
specified, the emphasis is drawn around the<!-- entering slot 325 --> record.
<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<P>
CA_ORDEREDTARGETEMPH<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Shows where a container record
can be dropped during direct manipulation by drawing a line beneath the
record. Ordered target emphasis does not apply to the icon and tree views.
<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL>CA_MIXEDTARGETEMPH<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Shows
where a container record can be dropped during direct manipulation either
by drawing a line between two items or by drawing lines around the container
record. Mixed target emphasis does not apply to the icon and tree views.
<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<UL>Specify
the following attribute to draw lines that show the relationship between
items in the tree view.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->

the following to draw container records, paint the background of the container,
or both:<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
<P>
CA_OWNERDRAW<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL> Ownerdraw for the container, which
allows the application to draw container records.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 -->
</UL> CA_OWNERPAINTBACKGROUND
<!-- lm: 0x11 17 -->
<UL>Allows the application to subclass the container
and paint the background. If specified, and the container is subclassed,
the application receives the CM_PAINTBACKGROUND message in the subclass
procedure. Otherwise, the container paints the background using the color
specified by SYSCLR_WINDOW, which can be changed by using the PP_BACKGROUNDCOLOR
or PP_BACKGROUNDCOLORINDEX presentation parameter in the WM_PRESPARAMCHANGED
(in Container Controls)<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
