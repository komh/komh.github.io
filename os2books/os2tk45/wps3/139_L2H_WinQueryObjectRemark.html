<P>
This function allows you to obtain the persistant object handle for any
file object, by passing the fully qualified filename. Similarly any objects'
handle can be retrieved if its object ID string is passed. Once a program
has an object handle, it is able to change the objects state by using the
<A HREF="219_L2_WinSetObjectData.html">WinSetObjectData</A> function or
delete the object using the <A HREF="043_L2_WinDestroyObject.html">WinDestroyObject
</A>function. Note that valid object ID strings must always start with the
"&lt;" character and be terminated by the "&gt;" character, and are thus
invalid file system names.
<P>
Using <A HREF="487_L2_HOBJECT.html">HOBJECT</A> for .INI files or files
in which an application uses a rename/save/delete sequence is not supported.
