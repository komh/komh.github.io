<H1>Out-of-Band Data</H1><!-- entering slot 50 -->
<P>
The stream socket abstraction includes the concept of out-of-band data.
<I>Out-of-band</I> data is a logically independent transmission channel
associated with each pair of connected stream sockets. Out-of-band data
can be delivered to the socket independently of the normal receive queue
or within the receive queue depending upon the status of the SO_OOBINLINE
socket-level option. The abstraction defines that the out-of-band data facilities
must support the reliable delivery of at least one out-of-band message at
a time. This message must contain at least one byte of data, and at least
one message can be pending delivery to the user at any one time.
<P>
For communication protocols that support only in-band signaling (that is,
the urgent data is delivered in sequence with the normal data), the operating
system normally extracts the data from the normal data stream and stores
it separately. This allows users to choose between receiving the urgent
data in order and receiving it out of sequence without having to buffer
all the intervening data.
<P>
If multiple sockets have out-of-band data awaiting delivery, an application
program can use a select() call for exceptional conditions to determine
those sockets with such data pending. The select() call does not indicate
the actual arrival of the out-of-band data, but only notification that it
is pending.
<P>
In addition to the information passed, a logical mark is placed in the data
stream to indicate the point at which the out-of-band data was sent. When
a signal flushes any pending output, all data up to the mark in the data
stream is discarded.
<P>
To send an out-of-band message, the MSG_OOB flag is supplied to a send()
or sendto() call. To receive out-of-band data, an application program must
set the MSG_OOB flag when performing a recvfrom() or recv() call.
<P>
An application program can determine if the read pointer is currently pointing
at the logical mark in the data stream, by using the SIOCATMARK ioctl()
call.
<P>
A process can also read or peek at the out-of-band data without first reading
up to the logical mark. This is more difficult when the underlying protocol
delivers the urgent data in-band with the normal data, and only sends notification
of its presence ahead of time (that is, the TCP protocol used to implement
streams in the internet domain). With such protocols, the out-of-band byte
may not have arrived when a recv() call is performed with the MSG_OOB flag.
In that case, the call will return an SOCEWOULDBLOCK error code. There may
be enough in-band data in the input buffer for normal flow control to prevent
the peer from sending the urgent data until the buffer is cleared. The process
must then read enough of the queued data so that the urgent data can be
delivered.
<P>
Certain programs that use multiple bytes of urgent data, and that must handle
multiple urgent signals, need to retain the position of urgent data within
the stream. The socket-level option, SO_OOBINLINE provides the capability.
With this option, the position of the urgent data (the logical mark) is
retained. The urgent data immediately follows the mark within the normal
data stream that is returned without the MSG_OOB flag. Reception of multiple
urgent indications causes the mark to move, but no out-of-band data is lost.
