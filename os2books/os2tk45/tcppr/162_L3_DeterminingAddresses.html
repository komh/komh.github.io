<H1>Determining Addresses and Ports</H1><!-- entering slot 172 -->
<P>
The destination address and port are a specific IP address and port if the
data flow is unicast.  If the data flow is by way of a multicast group,
the destination address and port are for a multicast group.  Generally,
address and port determination depends upon the protocol to be used to send
and receive the data stream.
<P>
If the data flow is for the TCP protocol, the usual listen() - connect()
- accept() sequence can be done by server and client.  Then the IP address
and port for each end of the connection are available using the getsockname()
and getpeername() calls.
<P>
If the data flow is for UDP unicast or multicast, agreement about IP addresses
and ports may have to be done externally to the RSVP protocol or the UDP
protocol.  This would depend upon the application.  For example, it might
be necessary ahead of time to agree upon a multicast address and port to
use for a video broadcast.
<P>
When joining a multicast group as a receiver, it is possible to see path
messages to that group which are coming from senders.  Then a receiver can
make reservations for data flows from the senders.  A path message includes
the IP address and port of the sender.
<P>
RSVP is designed to use a variety of network address types. Thus the API
uses the more general sockaddr structure. To operate with Internet Protocol
addresses,  the sockaddr structure must be cast to sockaddr_in.
