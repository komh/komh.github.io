<H1>Internet Address Formats</H1><!-- entering slot 79 -->
<P>
This section describes the address formats used in the internet domain.

<P>
internet addresses (IP) are 32-bit values that represent a network interface.
 Every internet address within an administered internet (AF_INET) communication
domain must be unique. A host can have as many internet addresses as it
has network interfaces. For more information about internet address formats,
see<I> Internetworking with TCP/IP Volume I:  Principles, Protocols, and
Architectures</I> , and<I> Volume II:  Implementation and Internals</I> ,
Douglas E. Comer, Prentice Hall, 1991.
<P>
Each internet host is assigned at least one unique internet address. This
address is used by IP and other higher-level protocols. When a host is a
gateway, it has more than one IP address.  Gateway hosts connect two or
more physical networks and have one IP address per connected physical network.

<P>
Addresses within an internet consist of a network number and a local address.
All physical host IP addresses share the same network number and are logically
part of the same network even if that network is connected with various
physical media.
<P>
Hosts on disjoint physical networks might also have the same network number,
but are not part of the same internet network. Hosts that are part of the
same internet network can exchange packets directly without going through
intermediate routers. An internet network can be subdivided logically using
a subnet mask. All host interfaces to the same physical network are given
the same subnetwork number. An internet domain can provide standards for
assigning addresses to networks, broadcasts, and subnetworks.
<P>
<B>Dotted-Decimal Notation:</B> A commonly used notation for internet host
addresses is the dotted-decimal format, which divides the 32-bit address
into four 8-bit fields. The value of each field is specified as a decimal
number, and the fields are separated by periods (for example, 10.2.0.52).

<P>
Address examples in this document use dotted-decimal notation in the following
forms:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>nnn.lll.lll.lll</I><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>nnn.nnn.lll.lll</I><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 --><I>nnn.nnn.nnn.lll</I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<I>nnn</I><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> represents part or all of a network number.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><I>lll</I><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL> represents part or all of a local
address.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>

A, B, C, and D addresses, subnetwork address format, and broadcast address
formats can be found in the<I> TCP/IP Guide</I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
<B>Addressing within an Internet Domain:</B> A socket address in an internet
communication domain is composed of five fields in the following sockaddr_in
structure: length, address family, port, internet address, and a .*  reserved
field. The sockaddr_in structure should be cleared before use. The structure
is located in the &lt;NETINET\IN.H&gt; header file:
<PRE>struct in_addr {        u_long s_addr;
};
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>struct sockaddr_in {
        u_char sin_len;            /* sizeof (struct sockaddr_in) = 16 */
        u_char sin_family;         /* AFINET */
        u_short sin_port;          /* port id */
        struct  in_addr sin_addr;  /* address */
        char    sin_zero[8];       /* not used */
};
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> sin_len</I> field is set to 16 as the size of the sockaddr_in structure.

<P>
The<I> sin_family</I> field is set to AF_INET.
<P>
The<I> sin_port</I> field is set to the port number in network-byte order.
If you are specifying<!-- entering slot 80 --> your workstation address
in<I> sin_addr</I> and you set<I> sin_port</I> to 0 using the bind() call,
the system assigns an available port. If you specify a different workstation
address in<I> sin_addr</I>, you must specify the port. For more information
on ports, see <A HREF="085_L2_Ports.html">Ports</A>.
<P>
The<I> sin_addr</I> field is set to the internet address represented in
network-byte order. When specified as a parameter to bind(),<I> sin_addr
</I>is usually set to the constant INADDR_ANY, as defined in &lt;NETINET\IN.H&gt;.
This binds the socket to any and all local internet addresses. By using
INADDR_ANY, an application can bind a socket without specifying the local
internet address. The constant INADDR_ANY also allows an application running
on a host with multiple interfaces (called a multihomed host) to receive
UDP datagrams and TCP connection requests arriving at any interface on a
single socket. (The application is not required to have one socket per interface,
with each interface bound to a specific internet address).
<P>
To specify your workstation address, you can leave<I> sin_addr</I> unspecified.
 If you are specifying a different workstation address, you must specify
a valid internet address for that workstation.
<P>
The<I> sin_zero</I> field is not used, and it should be set to 0 by the
application before passing the address structure to any sockets call.
