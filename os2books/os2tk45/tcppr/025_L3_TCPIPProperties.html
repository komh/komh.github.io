Provides socket communication between a local process and a process running
on a remote host. The SOCK_STREAM socket type is supported by TCP (Transmission
Control Protocol); the SOCK_DGRAM socket type is supported by UDP (User
Datagram Protocol). Each is layered on top of the transport-level Internet
Protocol (IP). ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is implemented on
top of IP and is accessible through a raw socket. The raw socket interface,
SOCK_RAW sockets, allows access to the raw facilities of IP. Each raw socket
is associated with one IP protocol number and receives all traffic for that
protocol. This allows administrative and debugging functions to occur and
enables user-level implementations of special-purpose protocols such as
inter-gateway routing protocols.
