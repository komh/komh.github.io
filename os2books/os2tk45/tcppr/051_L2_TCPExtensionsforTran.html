<H1>TCP Extensions for Transactions (T/TCP)</H1><!-- entering slot 55 -->
<P>
A client-server transaction is a client request to a server followed by
the server's reply. TCP Extensions for Transactions (T/TCP) is an extension
to TCP designed to make client-server transactions more efficient. For typical
transaction processing, a reliable delivery of data is needed, with no explicit
connection setup or tear down, and with minimal idle state at both ends.
UDP is faster but not reliable. Standard TCP provides the reliability but
with the overhead of connection setup and time wait delay. T/TCP addresses
these needs. T/TCP can match UDP performance, and adds reliability.
<P>
The goal of T/TCP is to allow each transaction (request and response sequence)
to be efficiently performed as a single incarnation of a TCP connection.
Standard TCP imposes two performance problems for transaction-oriented communication.
 First, a TCP connection is opened with a three-way handshake which must
complete successfully before any data can be transferred. This handshake
adds an extra round-trip time to transaction latency. Second, closing a
TCP connection leaves one or both ends in time wait state (2 maximum segment
lifetime periods (2 MSL)), which limits the rate of successive transactions
between the same host-port pair, since a new incarnation cannot be reopened
until the time wait delay expires.  (The default value for the time wait
delay can be checked by using the INETCFG.EXE utility.)
<P>
T/TCP addresses the handshake issue by using TCP Accelerated Open (TAO),
which is based on using a new incarnation number called 'connection count
(CC)'. T/TCP uses the monotonic property of CC values to bypass the handshake.
A T/TCP server host keeps a cache containing the last valid CC value that
it has received from each different client host. If an initial SYN segment
(connection request) from a particular client host carries a CC value larger
than the cached value, then the incoming segment is ensured to be new and
the connection can be accepted immediately. The use of CC also truncates
the time wait delay. Apart from rate of transactions, reduction in the time
wait delay also saves locked-up resources from the hosts.
<P>
T/TCP introduces three new TCP options; namely, CC, CCnew and CCecho, and
adds seven new states to the existing ten finite TCP states. To invoke T/TCP,
both  client and server ends of the transaction must support T/TCP. The
CC value is sent by the client in the SYN segment (for active open) indicating
a willingness to use T/TCP. The server sends back CCecho in the SYN-ACK
segment, declaring that it understands T/TCP. The client can still optionally
disable T/TCP and force a handshake by sending a CCNew segment. If any of
the ends do not support T/TCP, the connection procedure reverts to the normal
TCP connection setup procedure.
<P>
To take advantage of T/TCP, the socket calls sequence on a typical T/TCP
client application is different from the client shown in  <A HREF="050_L2_TypicalSocketSession.html">A
Typical Stream or Sequenced Packet Socket Session</A>.  On a typical T/TCP
client application, after opening a Stream socket the client does not call
connect(). Instead, it calls sendto() with the flag of MSG_<!-- entering slot 56 -->EOF

<P>
T/TCP can be turned on for a system-wide effect through the INET configuration
utility command 'inetcfg -set CC 1'. You can use getsockopt() and setsockopt()
for each socket through the TCP_CC socket option.  By default the T/TCP
option is turned off.
<P>
To assure that T/TCP is being invoked, IP tracing function can be turned
on through 'iptrace -i', and the trace file IPTRACE.DMP can be formatted
with the IPFORMAT utility, which can explicitly show the three CC option
values in the formatted dump.
