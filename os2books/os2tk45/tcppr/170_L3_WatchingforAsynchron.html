<H1>Watching for Asynchronous RSVP Events</H1><!-- entering slot 180 -->
<P>
Both a sender and a receiver should continue to use a select() call on the
alert socket to watch for asynchronous error conditions.  The select() call
can be in separate thread, or it can be a select() call that is used in
sending or receiving the data stream.
