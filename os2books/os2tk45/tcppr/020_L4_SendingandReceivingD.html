<P>
The sockets API includes a variety of calls for transferring data. They
all operate similarly, but take different parameters to support different
levels of functionality. Some socket calls support scatter-gather communication.
Some support only connected sockets while others will work on any socket.
Some calls support additional flags to control how data is sent or received.
See <A HREF="045_L3_SendingandReceivingD.html">Data Transfer Calls</A> for
a summary of which calls support which options.
