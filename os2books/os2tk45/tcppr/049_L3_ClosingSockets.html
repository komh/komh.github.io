<H1>Closing Sockets</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
Closing a socket and reclaiming its resources is not always a straightforward
operation. In certain situations, such as when a process exits, a soclose()
call is expected to be successful. However, when a socket promising reliable
delivery of data is closed with data still queued for transmission or awaiting
acknowledgment of reception, the socket must attempt to transmit the data.
If the socket discards the queued data to allow the soclose() call to complete
successfully, it violates its promise to deliver data reliably. Discarding
data can cause naive processes, which depend upon the implicit semantics
of the soclose() call, to work unreliably in a network environment. However,
if sockets block until all data has been transmitted successfully, in some
communication domains a soclose() call may never complete.
<P>
The sockets layer compromises in an effort to address this problem and maintain
the semantics of the soclose() call. In normal operation, closing a socket
causes any queued but unaccepted connections to be discarded. If the socket
is in a connected state, a disconnect is initiated. When the disconnect
request completes, the network support notifies the sockets layer, and the
socket resources are reclaimed. The network layer may then attempt to transmit
any data queued in the socket's send buffer, although this is not guaranteed.

<P>
Alternatively, a socket may be marked explicitly to force the application
program to linger when closing until pending data are flushed and the connection
has shut down. This option is marked in the socket data structure using
the setsockopt() call with the SO_LINGER option. The setsockopt() call,
using the linger option, takes a linger structure. When an application program
indicates that a socket is to linger, it also specifies a duration for the
lingering period. If the lingering period expires before the disconnect
is completed, the socket layer forcibly shuts down the socket, discarding
any data still pending.
