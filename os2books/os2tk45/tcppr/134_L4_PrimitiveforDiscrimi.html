<H1>Primitive for Discriminated Unions</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
A discriminated union is a C language union, which is an object that holds
several data types.  One arm of the union contains an enumeration value
(enum_t), or discriminant, that holds a specific object to be processed
over the system first.
<P>
The XDR library includes the following routine for discriminated unions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
