<H1>Multicasting and the setsockopt() Call</H1><!-- entering slot 93 -->
<P>
When a datagram socket is defined, the setsockopt() call can be used to
modify it. In order to join or leave a multicast group, use the setsockopt()
call with the IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP or IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP flags. The interface
that is used and the group used are specified in an ip_mreq structure that
contains the following fields:
<PRE>struct ip_mreq{
   struct in_addr imr_multiaddr;
   struct in_addr imr_interface;
}
</PRE>

<P>
The in_addr structure is defined as:
<PRE>struct in_addr{
   ulong s_addr;
}
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
A<I> host group</I> consists of zero or more IP hosts.  An IP datagram designated
to a host group address will be delivered to all the current members of
that group.  A host group does not have a fixed membership.  Any IP multicast-capable
hosts can join or leave a host group dynamically.
<P>
To join or leave a host group, an application needs to specify a host group
address, ranging from 224.0.0.2 to 239.255.255.255, and a network interface
address.  (Note that 224.0.0.0 is reserved and 224.0.0.1 is permanently
assigned to the<I> all hosts group,</I> which includes all hosts and routers
participating in IP multicast.) It is possible to join the same host group
on more than one network interface.  It is also possible for more than one
application to join the same host group.  A host's IP module discards an
incoming multicast datagram designated for a host group not joined on that
incoming network interface, even though the same host group is joined on
another network interface.
<P>
In order to send to a multicasting group it is not necessary to join the
groups. For receiving transmissions sent to a multicasting group membership
is required. For multicast sending use an IP_MULTICAST_IF flag with the
setsockopt() call. This specifies the interface to be used.
<P>
An application can specify the time-to-live value of outgoing multicast
datagrams.  The default value is one for all IP multicast datagrams.  An
application can also specify whether a copy of the multicast datagram is
looped back in the case where the host itself is a member of the destination
host group.  By default, a copy of the multicast datagram is looped back.

<P>
It may be necessary to call the setsockopt() call with the IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
flag in order to control the loopback of multicast packets. By default,
packets are delivered to all members of the multicast group including the
sender, if it is a member. However, this can be disabled with the setsockopt()
call using the IP_MULTICAST_LOOP flag.
<P>
For hosts that attach to more than one network, an application can choose
which interface is used for the initial transmission. Only one interface
can be used for the initial transmission.  Further transmission to other
networks is the responsibility of<I> multicast routers.</I>  Do not be confused
by the interface where a host group joins the outgoing interface for multicast
transmission.  The interface specified when joining or leaving a host group
is mainly for receiving incoming multicast datagrams. An application can
join one host group on one network interface but transmit data to the same
host group by way of another interface.
<P>
Currently multicast is supported only on UDP, so datagram sockets should
be used to do multicast operations. One thing to consider is that using
aliasing and multicasting together (with multiple processes) may give unexpected
results, and the following limitations apply.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->More than one socket can bind on Class D IP address
(or mcast address) and a common port; for example, two clients that want
to receive the same mcast packet.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->These sockets must also set a socket option, SO_REUSEADDR.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The setsockopt() call flags that are required for multicast communication
and used with the IPPROTO_IP protocol level follow:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Joins a multicast group as specified
in the<I> optval</I> parameter of type struct ip_mreq. A maximum of 20 groups
may be joined per socket.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Leaves
a multicast group as specified in the<I> optval</I> parameter of type struct
ip_mreq. Only allowable for processes with UID=0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> IP_MULTICAST_IF
<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL>Permits sending of multicast messages on an interface
as specified in the<I> optval</I> parameter of type struct in_addr. An address
of<!-- entering slot 94 --> INADDR_ANY (0x000000000) removes the previous
selection of an interface in the multicast options. If no interface is specified
then the interface leading to the default route is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL>Sets multicast loopback, determining whether or
not transmitted messages are delivered to the sending host. An<I> optval
</I>parameter of type uchar is used to control loopback being on or off.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>IP_MULTICAST_TTL<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Sets the
time-to-live for multicast packets. An<I> optval</I> parameter of type uchar
is used to set this value between 0 and 255.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The getsockopt() function can also be used with the multicast flags to obtain
information about a particular socket:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
IP_MULTICAST_IF<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Retrieves the interface's IP address.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Retrieves
the specified looping mode from the multicast options.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> IP_MULTICAST_TTL
<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL>Retrieves the time-to-live in the multicast options.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following examples demonstrate the use of the setsockopt() call with
the protocol level set to the Internet Protocol (IPPROTO_IP).
<P>
To mark a socket for sending to a multicast group on a particular interface:

<PRE>struct ip_mreq imr;setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_IF, &amp;imr.imr_interface,
sizeof(struct
in_addr));
</PRE>

<P>
To disable the loopback on a socket:
<PRE>char loop = 0;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, &amp;loop, sizeof(uchar));
</PRE>

<P>
To allow address reuse for binding multiple multicast applications to the
same IP group address:
<PRE>int on = 1;
setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &amp;on, sizeof(int));
</PRE>

<P>
To join a multicast group for receiving:
<PRE>struct ip_mreq imr;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &amp;imr, sizeof(struct
ip_mreq));
</PRE>

<P>
To leave a multicast group:
<PRE>struct ip_mreq imr;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP, &amp;imr, sizeof(struct
ip_mreq));
</PRE>
