<H1>Socket Types</H1><!-- entering slot 34 -->
<P>
Sockets are classified according to communication properties. Processes
usually communicate between sockets of the same type. However, if the underlying
communication protocols support the communication, sockets of different
types can communicate.
<P>
Each socket has an associated type, which describes the semantics of communications
using that socket. The socket type determines the socket communication properties
such as reliability, ordering, and prevention of duplication of messages.
The basic set of socket types is defined in the &lt;SYS\SOCKET.H&gt; file:

<PRE>/*Standard socket types */

#define  SOCK_STREAM            1 /*virtual circuit*/

#define  SOCK_DGRAM             2 /*datagram*/

#define  SOCK_RAW               3 /*raw socket*/

#define  SOCK_SEQPACKET         5 /*sequenced packet stream*/
</PRE>

<P>
Other socket types can be defined.
<P>
OS/2 supports the basic set of sockets:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
SOCK_DGRAM<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Provides datagrams, which are connectionless
messages of a fixed maximum length. This type of socket is generally used
for short messages, such as a name server or time server, since the order
and reliability of message delivery is not guaranteed.
<P>
A<I> datagram</I> socket supports the bidirectional flow of data which is
not sequenced, reliable, or unduplicated. A process receiving messages on
a datagram socket may find messages duplicated or in an order different
from the order sent. Record boundaries in data are, however, preserved.
Datagram sockets closely model the facilities found in many contemporary
packet-switched networks.
<P>
An application can use the sendto() and recvfrom() calls or the sendmsg()
and recvmsg() calls to exchange data over a datagram socket. If an application
is using datagram sockets and calls connect() fully specifying the destination
address, the socket will be considered<I> connected</I>. The application
program can then use the other data transfer calls send() and recv() or
writev() and readv(). The connected or unconnected method of data transfer
stays in effect until connect() is called again with a different destination
address.
<P>
Datagram sockets may be used to send broadcast messages over TCP/IP and
NetBIOS. For TCP/IP, the constant INADDR_BROADCAST, defined in &lt;NETINET\IN.H&gt;,
can be used to send a broadcast datagram. For NetBIOS, the address format
has a type field that specifies whether the address is unique, multicast,
or broadcast.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> SOCK_STREAM<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Provides
sequenced, two-way byte streams with a transmission mechanism for stream
data. This socket type transmits data reliably (in order, not duplicated,
and retransmitted if necessary) without record boundaries, and with out-of-band
capabilities.
<P>
There is no guarantee for a one-to-one correspondence of send and receive
calls.  It is possible for data sent by one send() call to be received by
more than one different receive call, or the other way around.
<P>
Stream sockets  are either active or passive. Active sockets are used by
clients who<I> actively</I> initiate connection requests with connect().
Passive sockets are used by servers to<I> passively</I> wait for and accept
connection requests with the listen() and accept() calls. A passive socket
that has indicated its willingness to accept connections with the listen()
call<!-- entering slot 35 --> cannot be used to initiate connection requests.

<P>
After a connection has been established between stream sockets, any of the
data transfer calls can be used:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->send() and recv()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->sendto() and recvfrom()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->sendmsg() and recvmsg()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->writev() and readv()<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --> 
</UL> Usually,
a send()-recv() pair is used for sending data on stream sockets.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> SOCK_RAW
<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL>Provides access to internal network protocols and
interfaces. A raw socket allows an application direct access to lower-level
communication protocols, such as IP and ICMP. Raw sockets are intended for
advanced users who wish to take advantage of some protocol feature not directly
accessible through a normal interface, or who wish to build new protocols
atop existing low-level protocols.
<P>
Raw sockets are normally datagram-oriented, though their exact characteristics
are dependent upon the interface provided by the protocol. However, raw
sockets can be connected if connect() is called to specify the destination
address.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> SOCK_SEQPACKET<!-- lm: 0x11 2 -->
<UL> Provides
sequenced, reliable, and unduplicated flow of information. Every sequenced
packet is sent and received as a complete record.
<P>
After a connection has been established between sequenced packet sockets,
any of the data transfer calls can be used:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->send() and recv()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->sendto() and recvfrom()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->sendmsg() and recvmsg()<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->writev() and readv()<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --> 
</UL> Usually,
a send()-recv() pair is used for sending data on sequenced packet sockets.
