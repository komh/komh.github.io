<H1>What Is a Socket?</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
A socket is a communication channel abstraction that enables unrelated processes
to exchange data locally and across networks. A single socket is one endpoint
of a full-duplex (two-way) communication channel. This means that data can
be transmitted and received simultaneously. From an application program
perspective, a socket is a resource allocated by the operating system, similar
to a file handle. It is represented by an unsigned integer called a<I> socket
descriptor.</I> A pair of sockets is used to communicate between processes
on a single workstation or different workstations. Each socket of the pair
is used by its own process to send and receive data with the other socket.

<P>
When a socket is created, it is associated with a particular protocol stack
(called the protocol family) and socket type within that family. Communication
can occur only between sockets that use the same socket type within the
same protocol family.
