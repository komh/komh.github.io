<H1>Differences between OS/2 WInsock and the Winsock 1.1 Specification</H1><!-- entering slot 109 -->
<P>
This section describes the differences between the TCP/IP for OS/2 implementation
of Winsock and the Winsock 1.1 specification.
<P>
<B>WSASetLastError and WSAGetLastError APIs</B>
<P>
The Winsock specification states that on Win32 systems, WSAGetLastError
and WSASetLastError will simply call the Win32 GetLastError and SetLastError
functions.  For reasons of efficiency, the Open32 version of OS/2 Winsock
implements these two calls internally and does not call GetLastError or
SetLastError. Also because PM does not have a function that is equivalent
to SetLastError, the PM version of Winsock also implements these calls internally.

<P>
<B>BSD Compatibility Files</B>
<P>
The Winsock 1.1 specification states that the standard &lt;BSD NETDB.H&gt;,
&lt;ARPA/INET.H&gt;, &lt;SYS/TIME.H&gt;, &lt;SYS/SOCKET.H&gt;, and &lt;NETINET/IN.H&gt;
header files should be supplied by Winsock implementations and should just
include &lt;WINSOCK.H&gt;.  Because TCP/IP for OS/2 also supplies a BSD
socket library, it does not comply with the specification in this regard.
 If a developer includes any of those header files, the developer will get
the BSD version of those header files, not the Winsock version.
<P>
<B>Calling Conventions</B>
<P>
In the Winsock 1.1 specification, Winsock calls are defined to use the PASCAL
calling convention (the standard calling convention on Windows systems).
 OS/2 also has the PASCAL calling convention, but instead it uses APIENTRY
as the standard calling convention. Because of this, OS/2 Winsock uses the
APIENTRY convention for all of its Winsock calls.
<P>
In the Open32 environment, PASCAL is defined (with #define) to be APIENTRY
by &lt;OS2WDEF.H&gt;, which is part of Open32, so no changes are needed
to &lt;WINSOCK.H&gt; to accommodate APIENTRY.
<P>
In the PM and VIO environments, PASCAL and APIENTRY are two different calling
conventions, so the Winsock function prototypes in &lt;PMWSOCK.H&gt; have
been modified by replacing all occurrences of PASCAL with APIENTRY.
