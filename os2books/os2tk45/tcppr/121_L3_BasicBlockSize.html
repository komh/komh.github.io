<P>
The XDR language is based on the assumption that bytes (an octet) can be
ported to, and encoded on, media that preserve the meaning of the bytes
across the hardware boundaries of data. XDR does not represent bit fields
or bit maps; it represents data in blocks of multiples of 4 bytes (32 bits).
If the bytes needed to contain the data are not a multiple of four, enough
(1 to 3) bytes to make the total byte count a multiple of four follow the
<I>n</I> bytes. The bytes are read from, or written to, a byte stream in
order. The order dictates that byte<I> m</I> precedes<I> m</I>+1. Bytes
are ported and encoded from low order to high order in local area networks
(LANs). Representing data in standardized formats resolves situations that
occur when different byte-ordering formats exist on networked machines.
This also enables machines with different structure-alignment algorithms
to communicate with each other.
