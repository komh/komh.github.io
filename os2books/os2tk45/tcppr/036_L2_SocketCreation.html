<H1>Socket Creation</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
The basis for communication between processes centers on the socket mechanism.
A socket is comparable to an OS/2 file handle. Application programs request
the operating system to create a socket through the use of the socket()
call. When an application program requests the creation of a new socket,
the operating system returns an integer that the application program uses
to reference the newly created socket.
<P>
To create a socket with the socket() call, the application program must
include a protocol family and a socket type. It can also include a specific
communication protocol within the specified protocol family.
<P>
An example of an application using the socket() call is:

An Application Using the socket() Call
<BR>

<PRE>int s;
...
s = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the socket() call allocates a socket descriptor<I> s</I> in
the internet protocol family (PF_INET). The<I> type</I> parameter is a constant
that specifies the type of socket.  For the internet communication domain,
this can be SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, or SOCK_RAW. The<I> protocol</I> parameter
is a constant that specifies which protocol to use. Passing 0 chooses the
default protocol for the specified socket type. <A HREF="024_L3_SupportedProtocolFam.html">Supported
Protocol Families</A> includes information on default protocols. If successful,
socket() returns a non-negative integer socket descriptor.
<P>
See <A HREF="038_L2_SocketConnections.html">Socket Connections</A> for more
about creating sockets.
