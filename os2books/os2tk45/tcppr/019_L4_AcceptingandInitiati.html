<P>
Sockets can be connected or unconnected. Unconnected sockets are produced
by the socket() call. An unconnected socket can become a connected socket
by:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Client application: Actively connecting to another
socket, using the <A HREF="183_L2_connect.html">connect()</A> call<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Server application: Binding a name to the socket,
and then listening for and accepting a connection from another socket, using
the <A HREF="188_L2_listen.html">listen()</A> and <A HREF="179_L2_accept.html">accept()
</A>calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Stream sockets require a connection before you can transfer data. Other
types of sockets, such as datagram sockets, need not establish connections
before use.
