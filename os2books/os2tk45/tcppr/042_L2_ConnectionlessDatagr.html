<H1>Connectionless Datagram Services</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
The operating system provides support for connectionless interactions typical
of the datagram facilities found in packet-switched networks. A datagram
socket provides a symmetric interface for data exchange. While processes
are still likely to be client and server, there is no requirement for connection
establishment. Instead, each message includes the destination address.
<P>
An application program can create datagram sockets using the socket() call.
In the internet domain, if a particular local address is needed, a bind()
call must precede the first data transmission. Otherwise, the operating
system sets the local address or port when data is first sent. The application
program uses the sendto() and recvfrom() calls to transmit data; these calls
include parameters that allow the client process to specify the address
of the intended recipient of the data.
<P>
In addition to the sendto() and recvfrom() calls, datagram sockets can also
use the connect() call to associate a socket with a specific destination
address. In this case, any data sent on the socket is automatically addressed
to the connected peer socket, and only data received from that peer is delivered
to the client process. Only one connected address is permitted for each
socket at one time; a second connect() call changes the destination address.

<P>
A connect() call request on a datagram socket results in the operating system
recording the peer socket's address (as compared to a stream socket, where
a connect request initiates establishment of an end-to-end connection).
The accept() and listen() calls are not used with datagram sockets.
<P>
While a datagram socket is connected, errors from recent send() calls can
be returned asynchronously. These errors can be reported on subsequent operations
on the socket, or a special socket option, SO_ERROR. This option, when used
with the getsockopt() call, can be used to interrogate the error status.
A select() call for reading or writing returns true when a process receives
an error indication. The next operation returns the error, and the error
status is cleared.
<P>
See <A HREF="033_L2_SocketTypes.html">Socket Types</A> for more information
that you may need before connecting sockets.
