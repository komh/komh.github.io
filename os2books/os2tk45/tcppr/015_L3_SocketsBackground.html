The sockets API was developed in response to the need for sophisticated
interprocess communication facilities to meet the following goals:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Provide access to communications networks such as
an internet<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Enable communication between unrelated processes,
which can either reside locally on the same host computer or on multiple
host machines<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The sockets API provides a generic interface that allows networking applications
to use any protocol stack. After you pick the protocol stack, you can choose
the type of socket that you want, based on the communication characteristics
that you desire.  For example, stream sockets offer a reliable method of
data transmission without message boundaries, whereas datagram sockets offer
message boundaries but do not guarantee reliability.
