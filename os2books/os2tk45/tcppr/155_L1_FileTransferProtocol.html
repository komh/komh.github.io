<P>
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) API allows applications to have a client
interface for file transfer. Applications written to this interface can
communicate with multiple FTP servers at the same time. The interface supports
a maximum of 256 simultaneous connections and enables third-party proxy
transfers between pairs of FTP servers. Consecutive third-party transfers
are allowed between any sequence of pairs of FTP servers.
<P>
The FTP API tracks the servers to which an application is currently connected.
 When a new request for FTP service is requested, the API checks whether
a connection to the server exists and establishes one if it does not exist.
 If the server has dropped the connection since last use, the API re-establishes
it.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The FTP API is<B> not re-entrant</B>. If you are using a multithreaded
program, you must serialize the access to the APIs. For example, without
serialization, the program may fail if it has two threads running concurrently
and each thread has its own connection to a server.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
