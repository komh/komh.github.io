<H1>Sending and Receiving Data</H1><!-- entering slot 48 -->
<P>
Sending and receiving data can be done with any one of several calls. The
calls vary according to the amount of information to be transmitted and
received and the state of the socket being used to perform the operation.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The writev() call can be used with a socket that is
in a connected state, as the destination of the data is implicitly specified
by the connection.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The sendto() and sendmsg() calls allow the process
to specify the destination for a message explicitly.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The recv() call allows a process to receive data on
a connected socket without receiving the sender's address.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The recvfrom() and recvmsg() calls allow the process
to retrieve the incoming message and the sender's address.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
While the send() and recv() calls are virtually identical to the readv()
and writev() calls, the extra flags argument in the send() and recv() calls
is important. The flags, defined in the &lt;SYS\SOCKET.H&gt; file, can be
defined as a nonzero value if the application program requires one or more
of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
MSG_OOB<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Sends or receives out-of-band data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>MSG_PEEK<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Looks at data without reading.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>MSG_DONTROUTE<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Sends data without routing packets.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Out-of-band data is specific to stream sockets. The option to have data
sent without routing applied to the outgoing packets is currently used only
by the routing table management process, and is unlikely to be of interest
to the casual user. The ability to preview data is, however, of general
interest. When the MSG_PEEK flag is specified with a recv() call, any data
present is returned to the user, but treated as still unread. That is, the
next readv() or recv() call applied to the socket returns the data previously
previewed.
<P>
The following example shows an application sending data on a connected socket
and receiving data in response. The<I> flags</I> field can be used to specify
additional options to send() or recv(), such as sending out-of-band data.

bytes_received = recvfrom(s, data_received, sizeof(data_received), 0, &amp;from, &amp;addrlen);

<P>
The sendto() and recvfrom() calls take additional parameters that allow
the caller to specify the recipient of the data or to be notified of the
sender of the data. See <A HREF="194_L2_recvfrom.html">recvfrom()</A>, and
<A HREF="201_L2_sendto.html">sendto()</A>, for more information about these
additional parameters.
