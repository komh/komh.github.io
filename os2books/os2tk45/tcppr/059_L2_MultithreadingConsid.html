<P>
The sockets and network utility routines are completely reentrant. Multiple
threads of an application can perform any socket call.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Each thread that makes sockets calls has memory automatically
allocated for it by TCPIP32.DLL to store per-thread information (such as
the error code for the last sockets call made on that thread).  If a thread
only makes protocol-independent calls, the amount of memory allocated will
be small (on the order of 100 bytes).  If a thread issues any of the TCP/IP
network utility calls, however, a 4K block will also be allocated for that
thread.  None of the memory that is allocated will be deallocated until
the process terminates.  It will be reused however, if a thread terminates
and another thread is created.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
