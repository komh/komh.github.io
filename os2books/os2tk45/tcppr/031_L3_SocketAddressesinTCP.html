<H1>Socket Addresses in TCP/IP</H1><!-- entering slot 32 -->
<P>
TCP/IP provides a set of 16-bit port numbers within each host. Because each
host assigns port numbers independently, it is possible for sockets on different
hosts to have the same port number.
<P>
To ensure that socket addresses are unique within a network, TCP/IP concatenates
the internet address of the LAN interface with the port number to devise
the internet socket address. Since a host's internet address is always unique
within a network, the socket address for a particular socket on a particular
host is unique. Additionally, since each connection is fully specified by
the pair of sockets it joins, every connection between internet hosts is
also uniquely identified.
<P>
The port numbers from 0 to 1023 are reserved for official internet services.
Port numbers in the range of 1024-49151 are reserved for other registered
services that are common on internet networks. These port numbers are listed
in the ETC\SERVICES file. When a client process needs one of these well-known
services at a particular host, the client process sends a service request
to the socket address for the well-known port at the server.
<P>
The port numbers from 49152 to 65535 are generally used by client processes
which need a port, but don't care which one they get. These port numbers
are usually assigned by the TCP/IP stack when a connect() or sendto() is
performed without having done a previous bind().
