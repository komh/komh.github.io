<P>
Once a socket is no longer required, the calling program can discard the
socket by applying a soclose() call to the socket descriptor. If a reliable
delivery socket has data associated with it when a close takes place, the
system continues to attempt data transfer. However, if the data is still
not delivered, the system discards the data. Should the application program
have no use for any pending data, it can use the shutdown() call on the
socket prior to closing it.
