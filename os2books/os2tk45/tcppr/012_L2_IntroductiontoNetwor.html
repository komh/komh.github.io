<P>
OS/2 Warp has integrated networking services that provide a 32-bit sockets
API for the:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Internet (TCP/IP) domain<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->NetBIOS communication domain<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Local interprocess communication (Local IPC) domain
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>The sockets API lets you write distributed or client/server applications
using TCP/IP or NetBIOS to communicate across networks. The API also allows
interprocess communication within a single workstation. OS/2 Warp's sockets
API is based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Version 4.4 sockets
implementation. 
<P>
The OS/2 Warp operating system's networking services consists of three layers:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->The sockets layer<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>The
protocol layer<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>The device layer<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>The<I> sockets layer</I> supplies the interface between the calls and
lower layers, the<I> protocol layer</I> contains the protocol stacks used
for communication, and the<I> device layer</I> contains the device drivers
that control the network devices. The following figure illustrates the relationship
between the layers: Client / ServerModel

Processes communicate using the<I> client/server model.</I> In this model,
a server process acting as one endpoint of a two-way communication path
listens to a socket. At the other end a client process communicates to the
server process through another socket. The client process can be on the
same machine or on a different machine from the server process. The protocol
stack(s) on the machine(s) maintains internal connections, and routes data
between the client and server.
<P>
The following figure describes the OS/2 Warp kernel and internal structure
of TCP/IP Version 4.21 for OS/2 Warp.

<P>
The major components of the OS/2 TCP/IP stack are:
<P>
<B>Control Program</B>
<P>
<I>CNTRL.EXE</I> provides threads to run the TCP/IP stack.  It provides
a thread for each of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TCP fast timeout processing<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->TCP slow timeout processing<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Debug thread for IP<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->ARP timeout processing<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Watchdog thread for the adapter status<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Loopback IP packets processing<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
CNTRL.EXE is normally started from CONFIG.SYS with a RUN = statement. It
should be the first program to begin executing when TCP/IP is started.
<P>
<B>Sockets Layer</B> The sockets layer comprises the dynamic link libraries
for the different categories of applications, and the device drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->DLLs:
<P>
<I>TCPIP32.DLL</I> exports the 32-bit BSD Version 4.4 sockets API to applications.
<I>TCP32DLL.DLL</I> and<I> SO32DLL.DLL</I> together export the 32-bit BSD
Version 4.3 socket APIs to applications. These three DLLs are thread-reentrant.
<I>TCPIPDLL.DLL</I> provides the sockets APIs for 16-bit applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Device driver:
<P>
<I>SOCKETS.SYS</I> provides the common sockets layer for the protocol stacks.
Calls made to the socket APIs first pass through SOCKETS.SYS, which routes
the call to the correct protocol stack.  The socket address families supported
are<I> AF_OS2</I> (or equivalently,<I> AF_UNIX</I>),<I> AF_INET,</I> and
<I>AF_NETBIOS</I> (or equivalently,<I> AF_NB</I>).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Protocol Layer</B> The protocol layer holds the device drivers.
<P>
<I>AFOS2.SYS</I> is the<I>  Local Interprocess Communication (LIPC)</I> device
driver.  This driver supports AF_OS2 and AF_UNIX socket types. These socket
types can be used by applications within one OS/2 machine to communicate
with each other.
<P>
<I>AFNB.SYS</I> device driver provides support for sockets over NetBIOS.
 This driver supports applications written using the AF_NETBIOS or AF_NB
socket type.
<P>
<I>AFINET.SYS</I> is the transport protocol device driver for the AF_INET
socket type. AFINET.SYS is essentially TCP/IP code. It is compliant with
NDIS version 2.0.1; any MAC driver written to that specification should
work with the stack. SLIP, PPP, X25, and SNAlink use a<!-- entering slot 13 --> special
interface in this driver to their respective hardware.
