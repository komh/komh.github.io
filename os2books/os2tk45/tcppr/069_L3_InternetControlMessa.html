<H1>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</H1><!-- entering slot 74 -->
<P>
ICMP is used to pass control information between hosts. For example, the
information can be sent in any of the following situations:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->When a host checks to see if another host is available
(PING)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->When a packet cannot reach its destination<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->When a gateway or router can direct a host to send
traffic on a shorter route<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->When a gateway or router does not have the buffering
capacity to forward a packet<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
ICMP provides feedback about problems in the communication environment;
it does not make IP reliable. The use of ICMP does not guarantee that an
IP packet will be delivered reliably or that an ICMP message will be returned
to the source host when an IP packet is not delivered or is incorrectly
delivered.
<P>
Raw sockets can use ICMP and, like IP, ICMP is not typically used by application
programs directly.
