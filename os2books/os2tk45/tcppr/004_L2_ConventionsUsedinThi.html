<B>How the Term "Internet" Is Used</B>
<P>
An<I> internet</I> is a logical collection of networks supported by gateways,
routers, bridges, hosts, and various layers of protocols that permit the
network to function as a large, virtual network.
<P>
The term internet is used as a generic term for a TCP/IP network and should
not be confused with the<I> Internet</I> (note capital I), which consists
of large national backbone networks (such as MILNET, NSFNet, and CREN) and
myriad regional and local campus networks all over the world.
