<H1>Passing Sockets Between Processes</H1><!-- entering slot 63 -->
<P>
Because sockets are not file handles on OS/2, sockets are not automatically
passed from a parent process to a child process. Instead, sockets are global
to the system and unsecure, so that any process may access any valid socket.
To ensure sockets are always properly closed when a process terminates,
TCPIP32.DLL installs an exit list handler (with an order code of 0x99) that
closes all remaining sockets that were opened by that process. If a process
attempts to pass a socket to a child process, both the parent and child
need to notify TCPIP32.DLL that a change in ownership occurred so that the
exit list handler for the two processes close the correct sockets when the
processes terminate.
<P>
To pass ownership from parent to child, the parent process needs to issue
removesocketfromlist() with the socket number that is being transferred
to the child. The child process needs to issue addsockettolist() with the
same socket number to assume ownership of it. After these two calls are
completed, the child process's exit list handler will automatically close
the socket that was passed once the child terminates (unless the child application
closes the socket itself before it terminates.) See <A HREF="181_L2_addsockettolist.html">addsockettolist()
</A>and <A HREF="196_L2_removesocketfromlist.html">removesocketfromlist()
</A>for additional details.
