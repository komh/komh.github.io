<H1>High Performance Send</H1><!-- entering slot 58 -->
<P>
High Performance Send is a new feature of TCP/IP 4.21 that allows an application
to send data over sockets without incurring a memory copy.  To use it, special
memory is first allocated to the application from the TCP/IP stack with
the sysctl() call. Then the application calls  send(), sendto(), or sendmsg()
with the MSG_MAPIO flag. The application must wait for notification from
the stack that the stack has finished using the memory passed on the previous
send-type call. Only then should the application reuse the memory to send
more data.
<P>
There are two ways to determine if the stack has finished using the memory:
event semaphores and polling. These are described in <A HREF="056_L3_DeterminingifHPSMemo.html">Determining
if HPS Memory is Available for Reuse</A>.
<P>
A complete example of using HPS appears in the samples directory of the
toolkit.
