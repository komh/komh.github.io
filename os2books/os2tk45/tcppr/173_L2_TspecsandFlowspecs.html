<H1>Tspecs and Flowspecs</H1><!-- entering slot 183 -->
<P>
The sender tspec contains a structure with five fields that define the flow.
The two receiver flowspecs also contain this structure.
<PRE>    typedef struct {
       float32_t  IS_Tspec_r; /* Token bucket rate (IP packet bytes/sec) */
       float32_t  IS_Tspec_b; /* Token bucket depth (bytes) */
       float32_t  IS_Tspec_p; /* Peak data rate (IP packet bytes/sec) */
       u_int32_t  IS_Tspec_m; /* Min Policed Unit (bytes) */
       u_int32_t  IS_Tspec_M; /* Max packet size (bytes) */
    }   IS_Tspec_t;
</PRE>

<P>
The token bucket rate (<I>r</I>) is in bytes of IP datagrams per second.
 That is, the packets must include the IP packet header (20 bytes) and either
the UDP header (8 bytes) or the TCP header (20 bytes), as well as the data
in the packet, when computing packet sizes.  The valid value of<I> r</I> may
range from 1 byte per second to 40 terabytes per second.  The bucket depth
(<I>b</I>) may range from 1 byte to 250 gigabytes.
<P>
The maximum packet size (<I>M</I>) should be no bigger than the maximum
transmission unit (MTU) of the path between sender and receiver. The value
of m must be no bigger than<I> M</I>.
<P>
In a tspec the sender indicates, for any arbitrary time period of<I> T</I> seconds,
that the amount of data sent in that period will not be greater than<I> r</I>*<I>T</I>+<I>b</I>.
 When computing this, any packet that is less than the minimum policed unit
(m) in size should be counted as<I> m</I> bytes.
<P>
The token bucket model is a way of viewing the transmission of data. The
sender has a stream of data that comes from some source, and the sender
expects to send it using RSVP.  The sender may need to send at a specified
rate dictated by the data stream source, for example an audio or video data
stream.  The receiver may need to output the data in a timely fashion after
receiving it as well.  The token bucket rate is the rate at which the sender
will send.  Imagine bytes (tokens) filling the token bucket.  When enough
accumulate so that the above formula is not violated, a packet is built
and sent.  The bucket is reduced by the amount that was sent.
<P>
The peak data rate (<I>p</I>) is mainly used in guaranteed flowspecs. It
can be set the same as r, for controlled load flowspecs.  In guaranteed
flowspecs, it is required that for any time period<I> T</I>, that the amount
of data sent in that period cannot exceed<I> M</I>+<I>p</I>*<I>T</I>.
<P>
A Guaranteed flowspec has a tspec and an rspec. An rspec is shown below.

<PRE>    typedef struct {
       float32_t  Guar_Rspec_R; /* Guaranteed Rate (IP packet bytes/sec) */
       u_int32_t  Guar_Rspec_S; /* Slack term (microseconds) */
    }   Guar_Rspec_t;
</PRE>

<P>
The guaranteed rate (<I>R</I>) and slack term (<I>S</I>) are computed by
the receiver based upon the values in the adspec in the path message.  They
are explained in a later section.
<P>
A sender and receiver in an RSVP session negotiate reasonable values of
packet size, and so forth, by using information in the path and reservation
messages.  Typically, a sender specifies the largest packet it is willing
to send.  This value will be in the path message tspec.  When the path message
is seen by a receiver, the packet size (in the adspec) will be the maximum
that can be handled by all the RSVP-enabled nodes that the message passed
through. (If one or more nodes was not RSVP-enabled, then that fact is also
indicated in the adspec.  In that case, the reservation that is made should
be considered unreliable.) Once the receiver makes a reservation, if the
reservation is subsequently merged with other<!-- entering slot 184 --> reservations
then a similar process can happen as the reservation message goes toward
the sender.  Thus the sender can see what the maximum packet size should
be for the packets to be sent reliably to all receivers.  If a packet is
larger than that size, it will be sent by "best effort" technique rather
than according to the reservation that was made.
<P>
A similar process occurs for delay through the network, so that the receiver
has an estimate of what sort of service it can expect and request.
