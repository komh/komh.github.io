<H1>Local IPC Address Format</H1><!-- entering slot 101 -->
<P>
A socket address in a local system is composed of three fields in the following
sockaddr_un structure: length, address family, and path name. The structure
is located in the &lt;SYS\UN.H&gt; header file:
<PRE>struct sockaddr_un {
    u_char  sun_len;             /* sockaddr len including null */
    u_char  sun_family;          /* AF_OS2 or AF_UNIX */
    char    sun_path[108];       /* path name */
};
struct sockaddr_un un;
</PRE>

<P>
The<I> sun_family</I> field is set to AF_OS2 or AF_UNIX.
<P>
The<I> sun_path</I> field is the OS/2 Warp file and path name to be used
as the address of the Local IPC socket. If the address is NULL, the bind
call binds a unique local address to the socket descriptor<I> s</I>. Each
address is a combination of address family (<I>sun_family</I>) and a character
string (<I>sun_path</I>) no longer than 108 characters.
<P>
Each socket must use a unique character string as its local name to bind
a name to a socket. The name in<I> sun_path</I> should begin with "\socket\".

<P>
For example,
<PRE>struct sockaddr_un un;
int sd;
sd = socket(PF_OS2, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
memset(&amp;un, 0, sizeof(un);

un.sun_len = sizeof(un);
un.sun_family = AF_OS2;
strcpy(un.sun_path, "\socket\XYZ", 12);
bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;un, sizeof(un));
</PRE>
