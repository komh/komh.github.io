<H1>Binding Names to Sockets</H1><!-- entering slot 39 -->
<P>
The <A HREF="206_L2_socket.html">socket()</A> call creates a socket without
a name. An unnamed socket is one without any association to a local address.
Until a name is bound to a socket, no messages can be received on it.
<P>
Communicating processes are bound by an association. The bind() call allows
a process to specify half of an association: local address and local port
(TCP/IP), or local path name (NetBIOS and local IPC). The connect() and
accept() calls are used to complete a socket's association.
<P>
An application program may not care about the local address it uses and
may allow the protocol software to select one. This is not true for server
processes. Server processes that operate at a well-known port need to be
able to specify that port to the system.
<P>
In most domains, associations must be unique. Internet domain associations
must never include duplicate protocol, local address, local port, foreign
address, or foreign port tuples.
<P>
Wildcard addressing is provided to aid local address binding in the Internet
domain. When an address is specified as INADDR_ANY (a constant defined in
the &lt;NETINET\IN.H&gt; file), the system interprets the address as any
valid address.
<P>
Sockets with wildcard local addresses may receive messages directed to the
specified port number and sent to any of the possible addresses assigned
to a host. If a server process wished to connect only hosts on a given network,
it would bind the address of the hosts on the appropriate network.
<P>
A local port can be specified or left unspecified (denoted by 0), in which
case the system selects an appropriate port number for it.
<P>
The bind() call accepts the<I> s,</I><I> name,</I> and<I> namelen</I> parameters.
The<I> s</I> parameter is the integer descriptor of the socket to be bound.
The<I> name</I> parameter specifies the local address, and the<I> namelen
</I>parameter indicates the length of address in bytes. The local address
is defined by a data structure termed sockaddr.
<P>
In the internet  domain, a process does not have to bind an address and
port number to a socket, because the connect() and send() calls automatically
bind an appropriate address if they are used with an unbound socket.
<P>
The bound name is a variable-length byte string that is interpreted by the
supporting protocols. Its interpretation can vary from protocol family to
protocol family (this is one of the properties of the protocol family).

<P>
An example of an application using the bind() call is:

An Application Using the bind() Call
<BR>

<PRE>int rc;
int s;
struct sockaddr_in myname;

/* clear the structure */
memset(&amp;myname, 0, sizeof(myname));
myname.sin_len = sizeof(myname);
myname.sin_family = AF_INET;
myname.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("129.5.24.1"); /* specific interface */
myname.sin_port = htons(1024);
...
rc = bind(s, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;myname, sizeof(myname));
</PRE>

<P>
For a server in the internet domain to be able to listen for connections
on a stream socket or issue recvfrom() on a datagram socket, the server
must first bind the socket to a specific address family, local address,
and local port. This example binds<I> myname</I> to socket<I> s</I>. Note
that the sockaddr_in structure should be zeroed before calling bind(). For
a more detailed description, see <A HREF="182_L2_bind.html">bind()</A>.
For information on the sockaddr_in structure, see <A HREF="074_L2_InternetAddressForma.html">Internet
Address Formats</A>.
<P>
The unique name<I> myname</I> specifies that the application uses an internet
address family (AF_INET) at internet address 129.5.24.1, and is bound to
port 1024. The preceding example shows two useful network utility routines.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->inet_addr()  takes an internet address in dotted-decimal
<!-- entering slot 40 -->form and returns it in network-byte order. For
a more detailed description, see <A HREF="252_L2_inet_addr.html">inet_addr()</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->htons()  takes a port number in host-byte order and
returns the port in network-byte order.  For a more detailed description,
see <A HREF="251_L2_htons.html">htons()</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The next figure shows how the bind() call on the server side uses the network
utility routine getservbyname() to find a<I> well-known</I> port number
for a specified service from the ETC\SERVICES file (for more information
on well-known ports, see <A HREF="085_L2_Ports.html">Ports</A>). The figure
also shows the use of the internet address wildcard value INADDR_ANY.  This
is the value generally used on a socket bind() call.  It binds the socket
to all internet addresses available on the local machine, without requiring
the program to know the local internet address. (The code fragment in the
preceding figure will run successfully only on the machine with internet
address 192.5.24.1.) If a host has more than one internet address (that
is, if it is multihomed host), messages sent to any of the addresses will
be deliverable to a socket bound to INADDR_ANY. Abind ( )CallUsingthegetservbyname
