<H1>Socket Data Transfer</H1><!-- entering slot 47 -->
<P>
Most of the work performed by the sockets layer is in sending and receiving
data. The sockets layer itself does not impose any structure on data transmitted
or received through sockets. Any data interpretation or structuring is logically
isolated in the implementation of the protocol family.
<P>
Once a connection is established between sockets, an application program
can send and receive data.
