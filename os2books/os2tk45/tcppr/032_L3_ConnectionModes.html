<P>
A connection mode refers to an established logical channel for the transmission
of data between two application programs.
<P>
The sockets API supports two connection modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Connection-oriented<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Connectionless<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> 
<P>
In the connectionless mode, sockets are not tied to a destination address.
Applications sending messages can specify a different destination address
for each datagram, if necessary, or they can tie the socket to a specific
destination address for the duration of the connection.
<P>
The connection-oriented mode requires a logical connection to be established
between two applications before data transfer or communication can occur.
Applications encounter some overhead during the connection establishment
phase as the applications negotiate the connection request. This mode is
useful for applications that use long datastream transmissions or require
reliable transmissions of data.
<P>
The connectionless mode does not require a logical connection to allow communication
between applications. Rather, individual messages are transmitted independently
from one application to another application. Each message must contain the
data and all information required for delivery of the message to its destination.
Normally, datagram and raw socket types use the connectionless mode.
<P>
The term<I> connected</I> refers to two endpoints that have an established
logical connection between them. Stream and sequenced packet socket types
use the connection-oriented mode. For information on how datagram and raw
socket types can be<I> connected</I>, see <A HREF="183_L2_connect.html">Datagram
or Raw Sockets</A>.
