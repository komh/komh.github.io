<P>
RSVP is a Quality of Service (QoS) setup protocol. Quality of Service is
a set of communication characteristics required by an application. RSVP
does not send or receive data.  Other protocols do the actual transmitting
and receiving of data.  A 5-tuple (protocol, destination address, destination
port, sender address, sender port) defines the data flow for a QoS. RSVP
sets up QoS for flow in a single direction.  If two programs will be both
sending and receiving and need QoS for each direction, QoS for each flow
must be reserved independently.  Initial implementations of RSVP have been
mainly concerned with UDP unicast or UDP multicast, or other IP protocols,
such as TCP.
<P>
The RSVPD.EXE daemon implements the RSVP protocol. Applications use an API
interface (LIBRSVP.DLL) to communicate with the daemon. The associated toolkit
contains a header file (RSVPRAPI.H) and the library stub for the DLL (LIBRSVP.LIB).

<P>
The sender initiates a session and causes RSVP path messages to go to the
receiver.  The path messages indicate what flow the sender is willing to
send.  RSVP daemons between the sender and receiver can also add information
about what flows they can support.  A reservation is set up when the  receiver
sends a reservation to the sender of a path message.  The receiver can ask
for confirmation that the reservation was set up.
<P>
Once a flow is established, the daemons along that flow maintain it automatically
by periodically resending path packets from the sender daemon and resending
reservation packets in the reverse direction from the receiver's daemon.

<P>
There are two types of QoS specification: a controlled load flowspec and
a guaranteed flowspec.
<P>
Generally, requesting a Quality of Service means at least that a specific
bandwidth (number of bytes per second) is requested.  There are five parameters
in a controlled load flowspec.  There are implications in these parameters
about how much the packets can get "bunched up."  For example, if you send
a 100K burst of packets once every two seconds, the average data rate is
50K per second.  This data flow could be unacceptable, because the sender
or receiver (or intervening routers) might only be able to handle 10K bursts
every 0.2 seconds, for a much more even flow of data.  In the part of the
TCP/IP stack that performs QoS processing on the local machine, setting
up for a particular reservation usually involves at least two major actions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->prioritizing packets as they wait to leave the machine
onto the network (or to applications running on the machine)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->preallocation of buffers so that space resources will
be adequate for the QoS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some applications, like audio data for a conversation, where excessive delay
can easily become intolerable, require packets to be delivered within a
specified time. Such applications should use the guaranteed flowspec.<!-- entering slot 169 --> Besides
the five parameters of the controlled load flowspec, two other parameters,
guaranteed rate and slack term, specify the delay through the network.
