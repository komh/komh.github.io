<H1>Creating and Binding Sockets</H1><!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
A socket is created with the socket() call. This call creates a socket of
a specified:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->protocol family<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->socket type<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->protocol<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>Sockets have different qualities depending on these specifications.
The<I> protocol family</I> specifies the protocol stack to be used with
the created socket. The<I> socket type</I> defines its communication properties
such as reliability, ordering, and prevention of duplication of messages
(see <A HREF="033_L2_SocketTypes.html">Socket Types</A>). The<I> protocol
</I>specifies which network protocol to use within the domain. The protocol
must support the characteristics requested by the socket type.
<P>
An application can use the bind() call to associate a local name (usually
a network address) with a socket. The form and meaning of socket addresses
are dependent on the protocol family in which the socket is created. The
socket name is specified by a sockaddr structure.
<P>
The <A HREF="182_L2_bind.html">bind()</A> call is optional under some circumstances:
the <A HREF="183_L2_connect.html">connect()</A> call and any of the data
transmission calls (for example, <A HREF="198_L2_send.html"> send()</A>)
will automatically associate the local name to the socket if bind() hasn't
been called.
