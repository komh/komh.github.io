<P>
Once sockets are no longer of use they can be shut down or closed using
the shutdown() or soclose() call. Typically, the shutdown() call is used
if you want to shut down data transfer in one direction while keeping the
other direction open.  The soclose() call shuts down data transfer in both
directions and then releases the resources associated with the socket.
