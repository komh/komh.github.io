<H1>Controlled Load Reservations</H1><!-- entering slot 186 -->
<P>
The controlled load reservation requests a reservation for a guaranteed
data rate.  The receiver is asking for an IP packet byte rate that is no
greater than<I> r</I>*<I>T</I>+<I>b</I> bytes for any arbitrary time of
<I>T</I> seconds.  The receiver expects to not need more than b bytes of
packet space for arriving packets in the TCP/IP stack, while it is busy
processing previously received packets.  The receiver should request a maximum
packet size<I> M</I> no bigger than the composedMTU from the controlled
load adspec.  When computing<I> r</I>*<I>T</I>+<I>b</I>, packets smaller
than<I> m</I> should be treated as if they were size<I> m</I>. The peak
rate<I> p</I> in the reservation is checked for validity but usually is
ignored.
<P>
For more information, refer to Internet RFC 1633,<I> Integrated Services
in the Internet Architecture: an Overview</I>, and Internet Draft<I> draft-ietf-intserv-ctrl-load-svc-07</I>.
