<H1>Getting an Alert Socket</H1><!-- entering slot 174 -->
<P>
The sender and receiver both would issue a rapi_getfd() call at this point.
The call returns an alert socket.  The socket is used to send data to the
RSVP API.  The program should issue a select() call on the socket as a read
socket in order to know when asynchronous events are available. The program
should not read the socket.
<P>
If the program is going to receive data, this is a good point to use select()
to wait for path messages that indicate that one or more senders are available.
There is an example of this in a later section.
<P>
If the program is going to send data, this is a good time to tell the RSVP
API that the program will be a sender.
