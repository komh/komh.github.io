<H1>Portmapper Protocol</H1><!-- entering slot 122 -->
<P>
The Portmapper protocol defines a network service that clients use to look
up the port number of any remote program supported by the server. The client
programs must find the port numbers of the server programs that they intend
to use.
<P>
The Portmapper program:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Maps RPC program and version numbers to transport
specific port numbers.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Enables dynamic binding of remote programs. This is
desirable because the range of reserved port numbers is small, and the number
of potential remote programs is large. When running only the Portmapper
program on a reserved port, you can determine the port numbers of other
remote programs by querying Portmapper.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Supports both the UDP and TCP protocols.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>The RPC client contacts Portmapper on port number 111 on either of
these protocols.
