<H1>R0LIB32 Library</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
Ring-3 application programs access the networking kernel through tcp32dll.dll
and so32dll.dll. For the device drivers at Ring-0, the ring transitions
to access the networking kernel (sockets.sys) are very costly, and hence
the r0lib.lib interface provides a way to access the networking kernel through
16-bit API calls. Because the r0lib is a 16-bit interface and the TCP/IP
stack version 4.21 and above is a 32-bit stack, version 4.21 provides a
new library at Ring-0, called<B> r0lib32</B>.
<P>
This new library not only saves the thunking in the stack kernel, but also
bypasses the thunking layer, which is required for the 32-bit device drivers
to go through the existing r0lib. All 32-bit device drivers can now use
the<B> r0lib32</B> to get into the stack without any thunking or ring transition
overheads.
