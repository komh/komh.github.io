<H1>Accessing a TCP/IP API DLL from an Intermediate DLL</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
A TCP/IP API DLL can be accessed both directly from an application and through
an intermediate DLL. An example of an intermediate DLL is a virtual network
API layer that supports generalized network functionality for applications
and uses the TCP/IP API.
<P>
The OS/2 Warp Toolkit contains a sample program to build a DLL.  You can
find the program in the SAMPLES\TCPIPTK\SAMPDLL directory.
<P>
For more information about DLLs, refer to the<I> OS/2 Warp Technical Library,
Control Programming Guide</I>
