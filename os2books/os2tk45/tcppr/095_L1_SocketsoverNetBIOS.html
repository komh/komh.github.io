<H1>Sockets over NetBIOS</H1><!-- entering slot 102 -->
<P>
This section describes the use of sockets with NetBIOS. Each application
assigns itself one or more NetBIOS names for each adapter.  The NetBIOS
protocol maintains a table of the names that a node is known by on the network.
 NetBIOS supports two types of names:<I> unique</I> and<I> group.</I> When
the name is unique, the application binds the name and NetBIOS checks the
network to ensure that the name is not already being used as a unique name.
NetBIOS supports multicast by allowing applications to bind to a group name
and communicate.
