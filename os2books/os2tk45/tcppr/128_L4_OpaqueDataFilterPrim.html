<H1>Opaque Data Filter Primitive</H1><!-- entering slot 135 -->
<P>
Opaque data is composed of bytes of a fixed size that are not interpreted
as they pass through the data streams. Opaque data bytes, such as handles,
are passed between server and client without being inspected by the client.
The client uses the data as it is and then returns it to the server. By
definition, the actual data contained in the opaque object is not portable
between computers.
<P>
The XDR library includes the following routine for opaque data:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
