<H1>Blocking Hook Support</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
Blocking hooks were introduced in Winsock to support Windows 3.x's non-preemptive
multitasking.  When an application issues a blocking sockets call, Winsock
starts processing the call and then enters a loop where it alternates between
calling a blocking hook and checking to see if the socket call has completed
or been cancelled. The blocking hook is responsible for dispatching messages
to keep the system responsive while the socket call is processing. Blocking
hooks are installed on a per-thread basis.
<P>
In Win32 systems, blocking hooks aren't necessary because Win32 systems
support preemptive multitasking.  Consequently, Win32 versions of Winsock
do not provide a default blocking hook, and using blocking hooks is discouraged.
Nonetheless, an application programmer can call WSASetBlockingHook to install
one.
<P>
In the OS/2 implementation of Winsock, when a call is made to a Winsock
function that blocks and a blocking hook has been installed in that thread,
a new thread is started to issue the socket call.  The original thread then
starts spinning in a loop, alternating between calling the user's blocking-hook
function and checking to see if the socket call has completed or has been
cancelled.  A half-second sleep is inserted between each iteration of the
loop to avoid consuming large amounts of CPU time.  When the socket call
completes, or is cancelled, the new thread passes the results of the socket
call to the original thread and then ends.
<P>
When a call is made to a Winsock function that blocks and a blocking hook
has not been installed for that thread, the socket call is issued directly
and no threads are started.
