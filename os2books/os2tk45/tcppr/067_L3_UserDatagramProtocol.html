<H1>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</H1><!-- entering slot 72 -->
<P>
UDP is a transport-layer datagram protocol that sends and receives whole
packets across the network. UDP is used for application-to-application programs
between TCP/IP hosts. UDP does not offer a guarantee of datagram delivery
or duplication protection.  UDP does provide checksums for both the header
and data portions of a datagram. However, applications that require reliable
delivery of streams of data should use TCP. UDP is the default protocol
for datagram sockets in the internet domain.
<P>
Unlike applications using TCP, UDP applications are usually connectionless.
 A UDP socket application can become connected by calling the connect()
API. An unconnected socket can be used to communicate with many hosts; but
a connected socket, because it has a dedicated destination, can exchange
data with only one host at a time.
<P>
UDP is considered an unreliable protocol because it sends its data over
the network without verification. Consequently, after a packet has been
accepted by the UDP interface, neither the arrival of the packet nor the
arrival order of the packet at the destination can be guaranteed.
