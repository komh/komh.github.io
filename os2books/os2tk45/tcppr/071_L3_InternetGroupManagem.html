<H1>Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)</H1><!-- entering slot 76 -->
<P>
RFC 1112 defines IGMP, which describes interactions between IP multicast
hosts and multicast routers. A multicast router needs to know the current
membership of host groups in all attached local networks in order to forward
multicast datagrams to hosts on local networks.  IP multicast datagrams
will not be forwarded to local networks if there are no members of the destination
host group.
<P>
There are two types of IGMP messages transmitted on local networks. Both
types of messages are transmitted by multicasting to reduce network load.
 A multicast router periodically sends IGMP membership queries to hosts
on the same network.  An IGMP membership query is sent to the all-hosts
group (224.0.0.1).
<P>
Upon receiving a membership query from a multicast router, a multicast host
starts a random timer for each host group joined on the interface that receives
IGMP membership queries. A host sends IGMP membership reports when timers
expire. Membership reports are sent to the host group being reported.
<P>
If other hosts on the same network are to receive an IGMP membership report
on the same host group, these hosts should cancel the timer before it expires.
This prevents duplicated IGMP membership reports from flooding a local network.
An IGMP membership report is also sent when a host joins a new host group.

<P>
When a multicast router receives an IGMP membership report of one host group,
the router updates its knowledge of the current membership on a particular
network.  If no reports are received on a particular host group after several
queries, a multicast router assumes that there are no local members on that
host group and stops forwarding any multicast datagrams with that destination
host group.
