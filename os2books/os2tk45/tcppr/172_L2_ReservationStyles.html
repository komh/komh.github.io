<P>
Bandwidth reservation relates to the way the bandwidth is to be allocated
(the reservation type), and the technique used to select senders (the sender
selection). The reservation type may be distinct for individual data flows,
or may be shared among multiple data flows. The selection of the senders
may be explicit (meaning that individual senders are identified individually),
or it may be a wildcard selection that implicitly selects all the senders
to a session.  This table shows the reservation styles that are defined
for the various Sender Selection-Reservation Type combinations:
<PRE>┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│Sender Selection      Reservation Type      Reservation Style    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

<P>
The fixed filter (FF) style specifies a distinct flow for each sender. The
bandwidth reservations are made separately for each flow.  Parameters in
the reservation specify each sender explicitly.
<P>
With the shared explicit (SE) style, each of the senders is specified explicitly
in the reservation message, but the reserved bandwidth is shared by all
the senders wherever they can be merged upstream from the receiver.
<P>
The wildcard filter (WF) style specifies a single reservation of bandwidth
which is to be shared by all the senders.  This type of reservation is propagated
upstream to all senders as they become senders in the RSVP session.  Besides
there being a single bandwidth reservation for all the senders to the receiver
that makes the reservation, the other receivers in the same multicast group
will have their bandwidth reservations merged as well.  The "largest" such
reservation for the session at any point in the multicast tree determines
how much bandwidth is reserved at that point in the tree.
<P>
The wildcard and shared explicit styles are primarily useful for multicast
applications where the data sources are unlikely to transmit simultaneously.
