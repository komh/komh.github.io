<P>

<P>
This method performs name-lookup resolution in a similar fashion to<B> somFindMethod
</B>and<B> somFindMethodOK</B>, but are restricted to static but is restricted
to static methods. See the description of<B> somFindMethod</B> for a discussion
of name-lookup method resolution. Because this method is restricted to resolving
static methods, its interface is slightly different from the<B> somFindMethod
</B>interface; a method procedure pointer is returned when lookup is successful;
otherwise NULL is returned.
<P>
The<B> somFindSMethodOk</B> method is identical to this method except that,
with<B> somFindSMethodOk</B>, an error is raised if the indicated static
method is not defined for the receiving class, and execution is halted.
