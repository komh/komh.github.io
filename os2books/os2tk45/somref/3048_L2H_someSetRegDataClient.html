<P>
Client events are defined, created, processed, and destroyed entirely by
the application. The application can queue several types of client events
with EMan. This method sets the client event type field of the registration
data object. Thus, this information is communicated to EMan, helping it
deal with enqueueing and dequeing the different client events.
