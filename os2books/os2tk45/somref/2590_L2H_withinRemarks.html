<P>
The<B> within</B> method returns a sequence of objects within the Interface
Repository that contain the specified<B> Contained</B> object. If the receiving
object is an<B> InterfaceDef</B> or<B> ModuleDef</B>, it can only be contained
by the object that defines it. Other objects can be contained by objects
that define or inherit them.
<P>
If the object is global in scope, the sequence returned by<B> within</B> will
have its<B> _length</B> field set to zero.
<P>
When finished using the sequence returned by this method, the client code
is responsible for releasing each of the<B> Container</B>s in the sequence
and freeing the sequence buffer. In C, this can be accomplished as follows:

<PRE>if (seq._length) {
    long i;
    for (i=0; i
         _somFree (seq._buffer[i]); /* Release each Container obj */
    SOMFree (seq._buffer);        /* Release the sequence buffer */
}
</PRE>
