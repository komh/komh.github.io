<P>

<P>
This function provides a single uniform interface through which it is possible
to call any method procedure. The interface is based on the caller passing:
the object to which the method procedure is to be applied; a return address
for the method result; a<B> somMethodDataPtr</B> indicating the desired
method procedure; and an ANSI standard<B> va_list</B> structure containing
the method procedure arguments. Different method procedures expect different
argument types and return different result types, so the purpose of this
function is to select an<I> apply stub</I> appropriate for the specific
method involved, according to the supplied method data, and then call this
apply stub. The apply stub removes the arguments from the<B> va_list</B>,
calls the method procedure with these arguments, accepts the returned result,
and then copies this result to the location pointed to by<I> retVal</I>.

<P>
The method procedure used by the apply stub is determined by the content
of the<B> somMethodData</B> structure pointed to by<I> mdPtr</I>. The class
methods<B> somGetMethodData</B> and<B> somGetNthMethodData</B> are used
to load a<B> somMethodData</B> structure. These methods resolve static method
procedures based on the receiving class's instance method table.
<P>
The SOM API requires that information necessary for selecting an apply stub
be provided when a new method is registered with its introducing class (via
the methods<B> somAddStaticMethod</B> or<B> somAddDynamicMethod</B>). This
is required because SOM itself needs apply stubs when dispatch method resolution
is used. C and C++ implementation bindings for SOM classes support this
requirement, but SOM does not terminate execution if this requirement is
not met by a class implementor. Thus, it is possible that there may be methods
for which this function cannot select an appropriate apply stub. If an apply
stub can be selected, then<B> somApply</B> performs as described above,
and a TRUE value is returned; otherwise FALSE is returned.
