<P>
This method allows the Repository object to release the memory occupied
by implicitly referenced Interface Repository objects. Some methods (such
as<B> describe_contents</B> and<B> lookup_name</B>) may cause some objects
to be instantiated that are not directly accessible through object references
that have been returned to the user. These objects are kept in an internal
Interface Repository cache until the<B> release_cache</B> method is used
to free them. The internal cache continuously replenishes itself over time
as the need arises.
<P>
See the section entitled "A word about memory management" in the Interface
Repository Framework in the<I> SOM Toolkit User's Guide</I>.
