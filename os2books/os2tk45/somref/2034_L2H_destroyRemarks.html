<H1>destroy - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2035 -->
<P>
The<B> destroy</B> method deletes the<B> Request</B> object and all associated
memory.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This method is called "delete" in the CORBA 1.1 specification.
However, the word "delete" is a reserved operator in C++, so the name "destroy"
was chosen as an alternative. For CORBA compatibility, a macro defining
<B>Request_delete</B> as an alias for<B> destroy</B> has been included in
the C header files.
