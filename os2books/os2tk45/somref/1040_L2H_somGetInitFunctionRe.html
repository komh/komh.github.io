<H1>somGetInitFunction - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1041 -->
<P>
The<B> somGetInitFunction</B> method supplies the name of the initialization
function for OS/2 class libraries (DLLs) that contain more than one SOM
class. The default implementation returns the value of the global variable
<B>SOMClassInitFuncName</B>, which by default is set to the value "SOMInitModule".

<P>
For AIX, the name of the class initialization function is not important,
since AIX class libraries should always be constructed as shared libraries
with a designated entry point which can be executed automatically by the
loader when the class is loaded.  Consequently, the result of this method
is not significant on AIX.
<P>
Similarly, if an OS/2 class library (DLL) has been constructed with a DLL
initialization function assigned by the linker, you can choose to invoke
the<B> &lt;className&gt;NewClass</B> functions for all of the classes in
the DLL during DLL initialization. In this case (as on AIX), there is no
need to export a "SOMInitModule" function. On the other hand, if your compiler
does not provide a convenient mechanism for creating a DLL initialization
function, you can elect to export a function named "SOMInitModule" (or whatever
name is ultimately returned by the<B> somGetInitFunction</B> method).
<P>
The OS/2<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>, after loading a class library, will invoke
the method<B> somGetInitFunction</B> to obtain the name of a possible initialization
function. If this name has been exported by the class library just loaded,
the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B> calls this function to initialize the classes
in the library. If the name has not been exported by the DLL, the<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B>then looks for an exported name of the form<B> &lt;className&gt;NewClass</B>,
where &lt;className&gt; is the name of the class supplied with the method
that caused the DLL to be loaded. If the DLL exports this name, it is invoked
to create the named class.
<P>
On Windows, the SOM class manager does<I> not</I> call<B> SOMInitModule</B>.
It must be called from the default Windows DLL initialization function,
LibMain. This call is made indirectly through the<B> SOM_ClassLibrary</B> macro.

<P>
Regardless of the technique employed, the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B> expects
that all classes packaged in a single class library will be created during
this sequence.
<P>
This method is generally not invoked directly by users. User-defined subclasses
of<B> SOMClassMgr</B>, however, can override this method.
