<B>Description</B>
<P>
The Event Manager class (EMan for short) is used to handle several input
events. The main purpose of this class is to provide a service that can
do a blocked (or timed) wait on several event sources concurrently. Typically,
in a main program, one registers an interest in an event type with EMan
and specifies a callback (a procedure or a method) to be invoked when the
event of interest occurs. After all the necessary registrations are complete,
the main program ends with a call to<B> someProcessEvents</B> in EMan. This
call is non-returning. Eman then waits on all registered event sources.
The application is completely event driven at this point (that is, it does
something only when an event occurs). The control returns to EMan after
processing each event. Further registrations can be done from within the
callback routines. Unregistrations can also be done from within the callback
routines.
<P>
For applications that want to have their own main loop, EMan provides a
non-blocking call (the<B> someProcessEvent</B> method), which processes
just one event (if any) and returns to the main loop immediately. Note that
when this call is the only one in the application's main loop, CPU cycles
are wasted in constantly polling for events. In this situation, the non-returning
form of the<B> someProcessEvents</B> call is preferable.
<P>
AIX Specifics:
<BR>
On AIX this event manager supports Timer, Sink (any file, pipe, socket,
or Message Queue), Client and WorkProc events.
<P>
OS/2 Specifics:
<BR>
On OS/2 this event manager supports Timer, Sink (sockets only), Client,
and WorkProc events.
<P>
Thread Safety:
<P>
To cope with multi-threaded applications on OS/2, the event-manager methods
are mutually exclusive (that is, at any time only one thread can be executing
inside of EMan). If an application thread needs to stop EMan from running
(that is, to achieve mutual exclusion with EMan), it can use the two methods
<B>someGetEmanSem</B> and<B> someReleaseEManSem</B> to acquire and release
EMan semaphore(s). On AIX, since AIX does not support threads (at present),
calling these two methods has no effect.
