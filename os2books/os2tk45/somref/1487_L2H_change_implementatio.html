<H1>change_implementation - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1488 -->
<P>
The<B> change_implementation</B> method is defined by the CORBA specification,
<I>but has a null implementation in DSOM.</I> This method always returns
a NO_IMPLEMENT exception.
<P>
In CORBA 1.1, the<B> change_implementation</B> method is provided to allow
an application to change the implementation definition of an object.
<P>
However, in DSOM, the<B> ImplementationDef</B> identifies the server which
implements an object. In these terms, changing an object's implementation
(i.e., server) would result in a change in the object's location. In DSOM,
moving objects from one server to another is considered an application-specific
task, and hence, no default implementation is provided.
<P>
It<I> is</I> possible, however, to change the program which implements an
object's server, or change the class library which implements an object's
class. To modify the program associated with an<B> ImplementationDef</B>,
use the<B> update_impldef</B> method defined on<B> ImplRepository.</B> To
change the implementation of an object's class, replace the corresponding
class library with a new (upward-compatible) one.
