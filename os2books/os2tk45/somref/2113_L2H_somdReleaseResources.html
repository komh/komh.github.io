<H1>somdReleaseResources - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2114 -->
<P>
The<B> somdReleaseResources</B> method instructs a proxy object to release
any memory it is holding as a result of a remote method invocation in which
a parameter or result was designated as "object-owned".
<P>
When a DSOM client program makes a remote method invocation, via a proxy,
and the method being invoked has an object-owned parameter or return result,
the client-side memory associated with the parameter/result will be owned
by the caller's proxy, and the server-side memory will be owned by the remote
object. The memory owned by the caller's proxy will be freed when the proxy
is released by the client program. (The time at which the server-side memory
will be freed depends on the implementation of the remote object.)
<P>
A DSOM client can also instruct a proxy object to free all memory that it
owns on behalf of the client without releasing the proxy (assuming that
the client program is finished using the object-owned memory), by invoking
the<B> somdReleaseResources</B> method on the proxy object. Calling<B> somdReleaseResources
</B>can prevent unused memory from accumulating in a proxy.
<P>
For example, consider a client program repeatedly invoking a remote method
"get_string", which returns a string that is designated (in SOM IDL) as
"object-owned". The proxy on which the method is invoked will store the
memory associated with all of the returned strings, even if the strings
are not unique, until the proxy is released. If the client program only
uses the last result returned from "get_string", then unused memory accumulates
in the proxy. The client program can prevent this by invoking<B> somdReleaseResources
</B>on the proxy object periodically (for example, each time it finishes
using the result of the last "get_string" call).
