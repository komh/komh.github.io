<H1>somDumpSelfInt - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1260 -->
<P>
The<B> somDumpSelfInt</B> method should be overridden by a class implementor,
to write out the instance data stored in an object. This method is invoked
by the<B> somDumpSelf</B> method, which is used by object clients to output
the state of an object.
<P>
The procedure used to override this method for a new class  should begin
by calling the parent class form of this method on each of the class parents,
and should then write a description of the instance variables introduced
by new class. This will result in a description of all the class's instance
variables. The C and C++ implementation bindings provide a convenient macro
for performing parent method calls on all parents, as illustrated below.

<P>
The character output routine pointed to by<B> SOMOutCharRoutine</B> should
be used for output. The<B> somLPrintf</B> function is especially convenient
for this, since level is handled appropriately.
