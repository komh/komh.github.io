<P>
The<B> create</B> method creates a<B> SOMDObject</B>  which is used as a
"reference" to a local application object. An object reference is simply
an object which is used to refer to another target object -- one may think
of it as an "id",  "link", or "handle." Object references are important
in DSOM in that their values can be externalized (i.e., can be represented
in a string form) for transmission between processes, storage in files,
and so on. In DSOM, the proxy objects in client processes are remote object
references.
<P>
File somdtype.idl contains the specification:<B> typedef sequence&lt;octet,1024&gt;
ReferenceData</B>. To create an object reference, the caller specifies the
<B> ImplementationDef</B> of the calling process, the<B> InterfaceDef</B> of
the target application object, and up to 1024 bytes of<B> ReferenceData
</B>which is used by the application to identify and activate the application
object. When subsequent method calls specify the object reference as a parameter,
the application will use the reference to find and/or activate the referenced
object.
<P>
Note that (as specified in CORBA 1.1) each call to<B> create</B> returns
a unique object reference, even if the same parameters are used in subsequent
calls. For each reference, the<B> ReferenceData</B> is stored in the reference
data file (and backup file, if any) for the server.
<P>
The<B> SOMOA</B> class introduces a<B> change_id</B> method which allows
a server to modify the<B> ReferenceData</B> of one of its references. (The
<B>change_id</B> method is<I> not</I> in the CORBA 1.1 specification.)
<P>
<I>Ownership</I> of the returned<B> SOMDObject</B>is transferred to the
caller.
