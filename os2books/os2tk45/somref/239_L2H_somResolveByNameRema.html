<P>
This function is used to obtain a pointer to the procedure that implements
the specified method for the specified SOM object. The returned procedure
pointer can then be used to invoke the method. The C and C++ usage bindings
use this function to support name-lookup methods.
<P>
This function can be used for invoking dynamic methods. However, the C and
C++ usage bindings for SOM classes do not support dynamic methods, thus
typedefs necessary for the use of dynamic methods are not available as with
static methods. The function somApply provides an alternative mechanism
for invoking dynamic methods that avoids the need for casting procedure
pointers.
<P>
Assuming the static method "setSound," is introduced by the class "Animal",
the following example will correctly invoke this method on an instance of
"Animal" or one of its descendent classes.
