<H1>DSOM and CORBA</H1><!-- entering slot 1380 -->
<P>
Distributed SOM (DSOM) is a framework which supports access to objects in
a distributed application. DSOM can be viewed as both:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->an extension to basic SOM facilities<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->an implementation of the "Object Request Broker" (ORB)
technology defined by the Object Management Group (OMG), in the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification and standard, Revision
1.1. The CORBA 1.1 specification is published by x/Open and the Object Management
Group (OMG).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
One of the primary contributions of CORBA is the specification of basic
runtime interfaces for writing portable, distributable object-oriented applications.
SOM and DSOM implement those runtime interfaces, according to the CORBA
specification.
<P>
In addition to the published CORBA 1.1 interfaces, it was necessary for
to DSOM introduce several of its own interfaces, in those areas where:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CORBA 1.1 did not specify the full interface (e.g.,
<B>ImplementationDef</B>,<B> Principal</B>)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CORBA 1.1 did not address the function specified by
the interface (e.g., "lifecycle" services for object creation and deletion)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->the functionality of a CORBA 1.1 interface has been
enhanced by DSOM.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any such interfaces have been noted on the reference page for each DSOM
class.
