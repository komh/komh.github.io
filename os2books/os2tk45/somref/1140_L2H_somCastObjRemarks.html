<P>
This method changes the behavior of an object so that its behavior will
be that of an instance of the indicated ancestor class (with respect to
any method supported by the ancestor). The behavior of the object on methods
not supported by the ancestor remains unchanged.
<P>
This operation actually changes the class of the object (since an object's
behavior is defined by its class). The name of the new class is derived
from the initial name of the object's class and the name of the ancestor
class, as illustrated in the Example.
<P>
This method may be used on an object multiple times, always with the restriction
that the ancestor class whose behavior is selected is actually an ancestor
of the true (original) class of the object.
