<P>

<P>
The<B> somMergeInto</B> method transfers the<B> SOMClassMgr</B> registry
information from one object to another. The target object is required to
be an instance of<B> SOMClassMgr</B> or one of its subclasses. At the completion
of this operation, the target object can function as a replacement for the
receiver. The receiver object (which is then in a newly uninitialized state)
is placed in a mode where all methods invoked on it will be delegated to
the target object. If the receiving object is the instance pointed to by
the global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>, then<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B>is reassigned to point to the target object.
<P>
Subclasses of<B> SOMClassMgr</B> that override the<B> somMergeInto</B> method
should transfer their section of the class manager object from the target
to the receiver, then invoke their parent's<B> somMergeInto</B> method as
the final step.
<P>
Invoke this method only if you are creating your own subclass of<B> SOMClassMgr</B>.
You can invoke<B> somMergeInto</B> from an initializer for your new class
manager.
