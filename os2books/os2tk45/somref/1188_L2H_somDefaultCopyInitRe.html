<P>

<P>
The<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B> method would be called a "copy constructor"
in C++. In SOM, this concept is supported using an object initializer that
accepts the object to be copied as an argument. Copy constructors are used
in C++ to pass objects by value. They initialize one object by making it
be a copy of another object. In SOM, objects are always passed by reference,
so arguments to DTS C++ methods that receive call-by-value object parameters
are actually passed by reference. But, to correctly support the semantics
of DTS C++ call-by-value arguments, it is necessary to actually pass a<I> copy
</I>of the intended argument. In general,<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B> should
be used to make this copy.
<P>
The default behavior provided by<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B> is to do a shallow
copy of each ancestor class's introduced instance variables. However, a
class may always override this default behavior (for example, to do a deep
copy for certain variables). If it is possible to avoid modification of
fromObj when doing the copy, the method<B> somDefaultConstCopyInit</B> should
be overridden for this purpose. Only if this is not possible (and shallow
copy is not appropriate) would it be appropriate to override<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B>.

<P>
The considerations important to overriding<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B> are
similar to those described in the<I> SOMobjects Users Guide</I> for overriding
<B>somDefaultInit</B>. (See "Initializing and Uninitializing Objects" in
Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM.") The basic difference between
<B>somDefaultInit</B> and<B> somDefaultCopyInit</B> is that the latter method
takes an object (<I>fromObj</I>) as an argument that is to be copied.
