<P>
The<B> SOM_GetClass</B> macro returns the class object of which<I> obj</I> is
an instance. This is done without recourse to a method call on the object.
The<B> somGetClass</B> method introduced by SOMObject is also intended to
return the class of which an object is an instance, and the default implementation
provided for this method by SOMObject uses the macro.
<P>
<B>Important Note</B>: It is generally recommended that the<B> somGetClass
</B>method call be used, since it cannot be known whether the class of an
object wishes to provide special handling when its address is requested
from an instance. But, there are (rare) situations where a method call cannot
be made, and this macro can then be used. If you are unsure as to whether
to use the method or the macro, you should use the method.
