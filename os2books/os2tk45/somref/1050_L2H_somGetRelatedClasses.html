<P>
The<B> somGetRelatedClasses</B> method returns an array of class objects
that were all registered during the dynamic loading of the specified class.
These classes are considered to define an affinity group. Any class is a
member of at most one affinity group. The affinity group returned by this
call is the one containing the class identified by the<I> classObj</I> parameter.

<P>
The first element in the array is either the class that caused the group
to be loaded, or the special value -1, which means that the class manager
is currently in the process of unregistering and deleting the affinity group
(only class-manager objects would ever see this value). The remainder of
the array consists of pointers to class objects, ordered in reverse chronological
sequence to that in which they were originally registered. This list includes
the given argument,<I> classObj</I>, as one of its elements, as well as
the class that caused the group to be loaded (also given by the first element
of the array). The array is terminated by a NULL pointer as the last element.

<P>
Use<B> SOMFree</B> to release the array when it is no longer needed. If
the supplied class was not dynamically loaded, it is not a member of any
affinity group and NULL is returned.
