<H1>somUninit - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1373 -->
<P>
The<B> somUninit</B> method performs the inverse of object initialization.
Class implementors that introduce instance data that points to allocated
storage should override somUninit so allocated storage can be freed when
an object is freed.
<P>
This method is called automatically by<B> somFree</B> to clean up anything
necessary (such as extra storage dynamically allocated to the object) before
<B>somFree</B> releases the storage allocated to the object itself.
<P>
Code responsible for freeing an object must first know that there will be
no further references to this object. Once this is known, this code would
normally invoke<B> somFree</B> (which calls<B> somUninit</B>). In cases
where<B> somRenew</B> was used to create an object instance, however,<B> somFree
</B>cannot be called (e.g., the storage containing the object may simply
be a location on the stack), and in this case,<B> somUninit</B> must be
called explicitly.
<P>
When overriding this method, always call the parent-class versions of this
method<I> after</I> doing your own un-initialization. Furthermore, just
as with<B> somInit</B>, because your method may be called multiple times
 (due to multiple inheritance),  you should zero out references to memory
that is freed, and check for zeros before freeing memory and calling the
parent methods.
