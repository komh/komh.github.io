<P>
The<B> somFree</B> method releases the storage containing the receiver object
by calling the method<B> somDeallocate</B>. No future references should
be made to the receiver once this is done. The<B> somFree</B> method calls
<B>somDestruct</B> to allow storage pointed to by the object to be freed.

<P>
The<B> somFree</B> method should not be called on objects created by<B> somRenew</B>,
thus the method is normally only used by code that also created the object.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> SOM also supplies a macro,<B> SOMFree</B>, which is used to
free a block of memory. This macro should not be used on objects.
