<P>

<P>
This function is a general cleanup function that must be called by all Windows
applications before exiting. AIX and OS/2 programs may also invoke this
function, but it is not required on these systems because all necessary
SOM cleanup is performed by the operating system during program termination.

<P>
A convenience macro,<B> SOM_MainProgram</B>, which usually appears at the
beginning of each application, adds this function to the "atexit" list.
If the "atexit" mechanism does not work reliably with your compiler, or
if you know that your program bypasses the normal program termination sequence,
you should insert an explicit call to this function at the point where your
main program exits. (All main programs for Windows must begin either with
the<B> SOM_MainProgram</B> macro or with a call to the<B> somMainProgram
</B>function.)
