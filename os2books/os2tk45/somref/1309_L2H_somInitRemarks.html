<H1>somInit - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1310 -->
<P>
The<B> somInit</B> method is invoked to cause a newly created object to
initialize its instance variables or attributes.
<P>
<B>Note:</B>  The newer<B> somDefaultInit</B> method performs object initialization
more efficiently and is now the preferred approach for overriding initialization
in an implementation file. (The<B> somInit</B> method still executes correctly
as before.)
<P>
Because instances of<B> SOMObject</B> do not have any instance data, the
default implementation does nothing. It is provided as a convenience to
class implementors so that initialization of objects can be done in a uniform
way across all classes (by overriding<B> somInit</B>). This method is called
automatically by<B> somNew</B> during object creation.
<P>
A companion method,<B> somUninit</B>, is called whenever an object is freed.
These two methods should be designed to work together, with<B> somInit</B> priming
an object for its first use, and<B> somUninit</B> preparing the object for
subsequent release.
<P>
If objects of your class contain instance variables or attributes, override
the<B> somInit</B> method to initialize the instance variables or attributes
when instances of the class are created. When overriding this method, always
call all parent (base) classes' versions of this method<I> before</I>doing
your own initialization, as follows:
<P>
1. The overriding implementation should invoke the parent method for<I> each
</I>parent. For users of the C or C++ implementation bindings, this can
be done in either of two ways: (a) by calling a<B> _parents_</B> macro (which
automatically invokes all parent methods) or (b) by calling the<B> _parent_
</B><I>parentName&gt;</I><B>_</B> macro on each parent separately.
<P>
For more information on parent method calls, see the topic "Extending the
Implementation Template" in Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM," of
the<I> SOM Toolkit User's Guide.</I>
<P>
2. The code must be written so that it can be executed multiple times without
harm on the same object. This is necessary because, under multiple inheritance,
parent method calls that progress up the inheritance hierarchy may encounter
the same ancestor class more than once (where different inheritance paths
"join" when followed backward). A check can be made to determine whether
a particular invocation of<B> somInit</B>  is the first on a given object
by examining the contents of its instance variables; all the instance variables
and attributes of a newly created SOM object are set to zero before<B> somInit
</B>is invoked on that object.
<P>
More information and examples on object initialization (especially regarding
the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method) are given in the topic "Initializing and
Uninitializing Objects" in Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM," of
the<I> SOM Toolkit User's Guide.</I>
