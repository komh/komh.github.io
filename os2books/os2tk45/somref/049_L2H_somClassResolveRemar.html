<P>

<P>
This function is used to obtain a pointer to the procedure that implements
the specified method for instances of the specified SOM class. The returned
procedure pointer can then be used to invoke the method. The somClassResolve
function is used to support "casted" method calls, in which a method is
resolved with respect to a specified class rather than the class of which
an object is a direct instance. The<B> somClassResolve</B> function can
only be used to obtain a method procedure for a static method (a method
declared in an IDL specification for a class); dynamic methods do not have
method tokens.
<P>
The SOM language usage bindings for C and C++ do not support casted method
calls, so this function must be used directly to achieve this functionality.
Whenever using SOM method procedure pointers, it is necessary to indicate
the use of system linkage to the compiler. The way this is done depends
on the compiler and the system being used. However, C and C++ usage bindings
provide an appropriate typedef for this purpose. The name of the typedef
is based on the name of the class that introduces the method, as illustrated
in the example below.
