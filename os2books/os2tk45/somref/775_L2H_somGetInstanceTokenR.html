<P>

<P>
This method returns a data token "pointing" to the beginning of the instance
data introduced by the receiving class. This token can be passed to the
function<B> somDataResolve</B>  to locate this instance data within an an
instance of the receiver class or any class derived from it. Also the instance
data token for a class can be passed to the class method<B> somGetMemberToken
</B>to get a data token for a specific instance variables introduced by
the class (if the relative offset of this instance variable is known). This
approach is used by C and C++ implementation bindings to support public
instance data for OIDL classes (IDL classes currently have no public instance
data).
<P>
A data token for the instance data introduced by a class is required by
method procedures that access data introduced by the method procedure's
defining class. For classes declared using OIDL and IDL, the needed token
is stored in the auxiliary class data structure, which is an external data
structure made statically available by the C and C++ language bindings as
&lt;className&gt;CClassData.instanceToken. Thus, this method call is not
generally used by C and C++ class implementors of classes declared using
OIDL or IDL.
