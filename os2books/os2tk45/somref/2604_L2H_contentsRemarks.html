<P>
The<B> contents</B> method returns a list of objects contained by the specified
<B>Container</B> object. Each object represents a component of an IDL interface
(class) definition maintained within the Interface Repository.
<P>
The<B> contents</B> method is used to navigate through the hierarchy of
objects within the Interface Repository. Starting with the<B> Repository
</B>object, this method can list all of the objects in the Repository, then
all of the objects within the<B> ModuleDef</B> objects, then all within
the<B> InterfaceDef</B> objects, and so on.
<P>
If the<I> "limit_type"</I> is set to "all", objects of all interface types
are returned; otherwise, only objects of the requested interface type are
returned. Valid values for<B> InterfaceName</B> are limited to the following
set: {"AttributeDef", "ConstantDef", "ExceptionDef", "InterfaceDef",
<BR>
"ModuleDef", "ParameterDef", "OperationDef", "TypeDef", "all"}
<BR>

<P>
If<I> "exclude_inherited"</I> is set to TRUE, any inherited objects will
<I>not</I> be returned.
<P>
When finished using the sequence returned by this method, the client code
is responsible for releasing each of the objects in the sequence and freeing
the sequence buffer. In C, this can be accomplished as follows:
<PRE>if (seq._length) {
    long i;
    for (i=0; i &lt;seq._length;i++)
       SOMObject_somFree (seq._buffer[i]); /* Release each object */
    SOMFree (seq._buffer);                 /* Release the buffer  */
}
</PRE>
