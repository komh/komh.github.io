<H1>somLookupMethod - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 917 -->
<P>
The<B> somLookupMethod</B> method uses name-lookup resolution to return
the address of the method procedure that supports the indicated method on
instances of the receiver class. The method may be either static or dynamic.
The SOM C and C++ usage bindings support name-lookup method resolution by
invoking<B> somLookupMethod</B> on the class of the object on which a name-lookup
method invocation is made.
<P>
The<B> somLookupMethod</B> method is like<B> somFindSMethodOK</B> except
that dynamic methods can also be returned. If the method is not supported
by the receiving class, then an error is returned and execution is halted.
To check the existence of a method,<B> somFindMethod</B> can be used.
<P>
As always, in order to use a method procedure pointer such as that returned
by<B> somLookupMethod</B>, it is necessary to typecast the procedure pointer
so that the compiler can create the correct procedure call. This means that
a programmer making explicit use of this method must either know the signature
of the identified method, and from this create a typedef indicating system
linkage and the appropriate argument and return types, or make use of an
existing typedef provided by C or C++ usage bindings for a SOM class that
introduces a static method with the desired signature.
