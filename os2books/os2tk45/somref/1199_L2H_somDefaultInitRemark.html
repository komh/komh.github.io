<H1>somDefaultInit - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1200 -->
<P>

<P>
Every SOM class is expected to support a set of initializer methods. This
set will always include<B> somDefaultInit</B>, whether or not the class
explicitly overrides<B> somDefaultInit</B>. All other initializer methods
for a class must be explicitly introduced by the class. See Section 5.5,
"Initializing and Uninitializing Objects," of the<I> SOMojects Developer
Toolkit Users Guide</I> for complete information on introducing new initializers.

<P>
The purpose of an initializer method supported by a class is first to invoke
initializer methods of ancestor classes (those ancestors that are the class's
<B>directinitclasses</B>) and then to place the instance variables and attributes
introduced by the class into some consistent state by loading them with
appropriate values. The result is that, when an object is initialized, each
class that contributes to its implementation will run some initializer method.
The<B> somDefaultInit</B> method may or may not be among the initializers
used to initialize a given object, but it is always available for this purpose.

<P>
Thus, the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method may be invoked on a newly created
object to initialize its instance variables and attributes. The<B> somDefaultInit
</B>method is more efficient than<B> somInit</B> (the method it replaces),
and it also prevents multiple initializer calls to ancestor classes. The
<B>somInit</B> method is now considered obsolete when writing new code,
although<B> somInit</B> is still supported.
<P>
To override<B> somDefaultInit</B>, the<B> implementation</B> section of
the class's .idl file should include<B> somDefaultInit</B> with the<B> override
</B>and<B> init</B> modifiers specified. (The<B> init</B> modifier signifies
that the method is an initializer method.) No additional coding is required
for the resulting<B> somDefaultInit</B> stub procedure in the implementation
template file, unless the class implementor wishes to customize object initialization
in some way.
<P>
If the .idl file does not explicitly override<B> somDefaultInit</B>, then
by default a generic method procedure for<B> somDefaultInit</B> will be
provided by the SOMobjects Toolkit. If invoked, this generic method procedure
first invokes<B> somDefaultInit</B> on the appropriate ancestor classes,
and then (for consistency with earlier versions of SOMobjects) calls any
<B>somInit</B> code that may have been provided by the class (if<B> somInit
</B>was overridden). Because the generic procedure for<B> somDefaultInit
</B>is less efficient than the stub procedure that is provided when<B> somDefaultInit
</B>is overridden, it is recommended that the .idl file always override
<B>somDefaultInit</B>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is not appropriate to override both<B> somDefaultInit</B> and
<B>somInit</B>. If this is done, the<B> somInit</B> code will not be executed.
The best way to convert an old class that overrides<B> somInit</B> to use
of the more efficient<B> somDefaultInit</B> (if this is desired) is as follows:
(1) Replace the<B> somInit</B> override in the class's .idl file with an
override for<B> somDefaultInit</B>, (2) run the implementation template
emitter to produce a stub procedure for<B> somDefaultInit</B>, and then
(3) simply call the class's<B> somInit</B> procedure directly (not using
a method invocation) from the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method procedure.
<P>
As mentioned above, the object#initialization framework supported by SOMobjects
allows a class to support additional initializer methods besides<B> somDefaultInit</B>.
These additional initializers will typically include special#purpose arguments,
so that objects of the class can be initialized with special capabilities
or characteristics. For each new initializer method, the<B> implementation
</B>section must include the method name with the<B> init</B> modifier.
Also, the<B> directinitclasses</B> modifier can be used if, for some reason,
the class implementor wants to control the order in which ancestor initializers
are executed.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is recommended that the method name for an initializer
method include the class name as a prefix. A newly defined initializer method
will include an implicit Environment argument if the class does not use
a<B> callstyle=oidl</B> modifier.
<P>
<B>Important:</B> There are important constraints associated with modification
of the procedure stubs for initializers. These are documented in Section 5.5
of the<I> SOMobjects Developer Toolkit Users Guide</I>.
