<P>

<P>
This method performs name-lookup method resolution, determines the method
procedure appropriate for performing the indicated method on instances of
the receiving class, and loads<I> m</I> with the method procedure address.
For static methods, method procedure resolution is done using the instance
method table of the receiving class.
<P>
Name-lookup resolution must be used to invoke dynamic methods. Also, name-lookup
can be useful when different classes introduce methods of the same name,
signature, and desired semantics, but it is not known until runtime which
of these classes should be used as a type for the objects on which the method
is to be invoked. If the signature of a method is a not known, then method
procedures cannot be be used directly, and the<B> somDispatch</B> method
can be used after dynamically discovering the signature to allow the correct
arguments can be placed on a va_list.
<P>
As with any method that returns procedure pointers, this method allows repeated
invocations of the same method procedure to be programmed. If this is done,
it up to the programmer to prevent runtime errors by assuring that each
invocation is performed either on an instance of the class used to resolve
the method procedure or of some class derived from it. Whenever using SOM
method procedure pointers, it is necessary to indicate the arguments to
be passed and the use of system linkage to the compiler, so it can generate
a correct procedure call. The way this is done depends on the compiler and
the system being used. However, C and C++ usage bindings provide an appropriate
typedef for static methods. The name of the typedef is based on the name
of the class that introduces the method, as illustrated in the example below.

<P>
Unlike the<B> somFindMethod</B> method, if the class does not support the
specified method, the<B> somFindMethodOk</B> method raises an error and
halts execution.
<P>
If the class does not support the specified method, then<B> *</B><I>m</I> is
set to  NULL and the return value is meaningless. Otherwise, the returned
result is true if the indicated method was a static method.
