<B>Description</B>
<P>
This class describes a work procedure event object. It currently has no
methods of its own. However, it sets the event type in its super class to
say "EMWorkProcEvent" to help identify itself. These events are created
and dispatched by EMan when a work procedure (something that the application
wants to run when no other events are happening) is registered with EMan.

<P>
EMan passes an instance of this class as a parameter to the callback registered
for WorkProc Events.
