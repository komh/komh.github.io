This allows setting the event mask within the registration data object.
Essentially, this tells EMan what kind of event is being registered with
it. The event type list is a series of constants defined in eventmsk.h.
Although the current interface supports a  NULL terminated list of event
types, currently each registration with EMan names only one event type.
Thus, one usually gives only one named constant as the event type and follows
it with a  NULL parameter.
