<H1>A note on method naming conventions</H1><!-- entering slot 1381 -->
<P>
The SOM Toolkit frameworks (including DSOM) and CORBA have slightly different
conventions for naming methods. Methods introduced by the SOM Toolkit frameworks
use prefixes to indicate the framework to which each method belongs, and
use capitalization to separate words in the method names (for example,<B> somdFindServer</B>).
Methods introduced by CORBA have no prefixes, are all lower case, and use
underscores to separate words in the method names (such as,<B> impl_is_ready</B>).

<P>
DSOM, more than the other SOM Toolkit frameworks, uses a mix of both conventions.
The method and class names introduced by CORBA 1.1 are implemented as specified,
for application portability. Methods introduced by DSOM to enhance a CORBA-defined
class also use the CORBA naming style. The SOM Toolkit convention for method
naming is used for non-CORBA classes which are introduced by DSOM.
