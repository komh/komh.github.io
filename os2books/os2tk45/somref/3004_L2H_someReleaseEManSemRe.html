<P>
When EMan is used on OS/2, multiple threads can invoke methods on EMan concurrently.
EMan protects its internal data by acquiring SOM toolkit semaphore(s). The
same semaphore(s) are made available to users of EMan through the methods
<B>someGetEManSem</B> and<B> someReleaseEManSem</B>. If an application desires
to prevent EMan's event processing from interfering with its own activity
(in another thread, of course), then it can call the<B> someGetEManSem</B> method
and acquire EMan semaphore(s). EMan activity will resume when the application
thread releases the same semaphore(s) by calling<B> someReleaseEManSem</B>.

<P>
Callers should not hold this semaphore for too long, since it essentially
stops EMan activity for that duration and may cause EMan to miss some important
event processing. The maximum duration for which one can hold this semaphore
depends on how frequently EMan must process events.
<P>
On AIX, calling this method has no effect.
