<B>Description</B>
<P>
The<B> Principal</B> class defines attributes which identify the user ID
and host name of the originator of a specific request. This information
is typically used for access control.
<P>
A<B> Principal</B> object is returned by the<B> get_principal</B> method
of the SOM Object Adapter. The parameters of the<B> get_principal</B> method
identify the environment and target object associated with a particular
request-the<B> SOMOA</B> uses this information to create a<B> Principal
</B>object which identifies the caller.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Details of the<B> Principal</B> object are not currently defined
in the CORBA 1.1 specification; the attributes which have been defined are
required by DSOM.
<P>
