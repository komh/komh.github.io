<P>
This method returns the address of a zero-terminated string that gives the
name of the receiving class. This name may be used as a RepositoryId in
the<B> Repository_lookup_id</B> method (described in the SOM Interface Repository
Framework section) to obtain the IDL interface definition that corresponds
to the receiving class.
<P>
The returned name is not necessarily the same as the statically known class
name used by a programmer to gain access to the class object (e.g., via
the method<B> somFindClass</B>). This is because the method<B> somSubstituteClass
</B>may have been used to "shadow" the class having the static name used
by the programmer.
<P>
Also, when the interface to a class's instances is defined within an IDL
module, the returned name will not directly correspond to the names of the
procedures and macros made available by C and C++ usage bindings for accessing
class objects (e.g., the<B> &lt;className&gt;NewClass</B> procedure, or
the<B> _&lt;className&gt;</B> macro). This is because the token used in
constructing the names of these procedures and macros uses an underscore
character to separate the module name from the interface name, while the
actual name of the corresponding class uses two colon characters instead
of an underscore for this purpose.
<P>
This method is not generally overridden. The returned address is valid until
the class object is unregistered or freed.
