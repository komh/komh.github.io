<P>
<B>somPrintSelf</B> should output a brief string containing key information
useful to identify the receiver object, rather than a complete dump of the
receiver object state as provided by<B> somDumpSelfInt</B>. The<B> somPrintSelf
</B>method should use the character output routine<B> SOMOutCharRoutine
</B>(or any of the<B> somPrintf</B> functions) for this purpose. The default
implementation outputs the name of the receiver object's class and the receiver's
address in memory.
<P>
Because the most specific identifying information for an object will often
be found within instance data introduced by the class of an object, it is
likely that a class implementor that overrides this method will not need
to invoke parent methods in order to provide a useful string identifying
the receiver object.
