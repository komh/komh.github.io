<H1>somdExceptionFree - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1419 -->
<P>
The<B> somdExceptionFree</B> function frees the memory held by the exception
structure within an<B> Environment</B> structure, regardless of whether
the exception was returned by a local or a remote method call.
<P>
When a DSOM client program invokes a remote method and the method returns
an exception in the<B> Environment</B> structure, it is the client's responsibility
to free the exception. This is done by calling either<B> exception_free
</B>or<B> somdExceptionFree</B> on the<B> Environment</B> structure in which
the exception was returned. (The two functions are equivalent. The<B> exception_free
</B>function name is #defined in the som.h or som.xh file to provide strict
CORBA compliance of function names.) There is a similar function,<B> somExceptionFree</B>,
available for SOM programmers; DSOM programmers, however, can use<B> somdExceptionFree
</B>to free all exceptions (regardless of whether they were returned from
a local or a remote method call).
