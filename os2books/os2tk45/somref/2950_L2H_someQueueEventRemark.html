<P>
Client events are defined, created, processed and destroyed by the application.
EMan simply provides a means to enqueue and dequeue client events. Client
events can be used in several ways. For example, if an application component
wants to handle an input message arriving on a socket at a later time than
when it arrives, it can receive the message in the socket callback routine,
create a client event out of it, and queue it with EMan. EMan can be asked
for the client event at a later time when the application is ready to handle
it. Client events can also be useful to hide the origin of event sources
(that is, the original event handlers receive the events and create client
events in their place).
<P>
Dequeue is not a user-visible operation. Once a client event is queued,
only EMan can dequeue it.
