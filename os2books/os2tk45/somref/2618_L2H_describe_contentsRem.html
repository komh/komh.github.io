<P>
The<B> describe_contents</B> method combines the operations of the<B> contents
</B>method and the<B> describe</B> method. That is, for each object returned
by the<B> contents</B> operation, the description of the object is returned
by invoking its<B> describe</B> operation. Each object represents a component
of an IDL interface (class) definition maintained within the Interface Repository.

<P>
If the<I> "limit_type"</I> is set to "all", objects of all interface types
are returned; otherwise, only objects of the requested interface type are
returned. Valid values for<B> InterfaceName</B> are limited to the following
set: {"AttributeDef", "ConstantDef", "ExceptionDef", "InterfaceDef",
<BR>
"ModuleDef", "ParameterDef", "OperationDef", "TypeDef", "all"}
<BR>

<P>
If<I> "exclude_inherited"</I> is set to TRUE, any inherited objects will
<I>not</I> be returned.
<P>
The<I> "max_returned_objs"</I> argument is used to limit the number of objects
that can be returned. If<I> "max_returned_objs"</I> is set to -1, the results
for all contained objects will be returned.
<P>
When finished using the sequence returned by this method, the client code
is responsible for freeing the "value._value" field in each description,
releasing each of the objects in the sequence, and freeing the sequence
buffer. In C, this can be accomplished as follows:
<PRE>if (seq._length) {
    long i;
    for (i=0; i &lt;seq._length;i++) {
        if (seq._buffer[i].value._value)
                                    /* Release each description */
            SOMFree (seq._buffer[i].value._value);
        SOMObject_somFree (seq._buffer[i].contained_object);
                                      /* Release each object */
    }
    SOMFree (seq._buffer);            /* Release the buffer  */
}
</PRE>
