<P>
The<B> SOM_Resolve</B> macro invokes the<B> somResolve</B> function to obtain
a pointer to the static method procedure that implements the specified method
for the specified object. This pointer can be used for efficient repeated
casted method invocations on instances of the class of the object on which
the resolution is done, or instances of subclasses of this class. The name
of the class that introduces the method and the name of the method must
be known to use this macro. Otherwise, use the<B> somResolveByName, somFindMethod
</B>or<B> somFindMethodOk</B> method.
<P>
The<B> SOM_Resolve</B> macro can only be used to obtain a method procedure
for a static method (one defined in the IDL specification for a class);
not a dynamic method. Unlike the<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B> macro, the<B> SOM_Resolve
</B>macro performs several consistency checks on the object pointed to by
<I>objPtr.</I>
