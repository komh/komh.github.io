instance
<P>
An object-oriented programming term synonymous with object. An instance
is a particular instantiation of a data type. It is simply a region of storage
that contains a value or group of values. For example, if a class box is
previously defined, two instances of a class box could be instantiated with
the declaration:
<PRE>box box1, box2;</PRE>
