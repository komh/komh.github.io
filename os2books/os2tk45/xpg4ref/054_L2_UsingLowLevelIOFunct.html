<H1>Using Low-Level I/O Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 54 -->
<P>
<I>The Developer's Toolkit</I> compiler supports both stream and low-level
I/O. The primary difference between the two types of I/O is that low-level
I/O leaves the responsibility of buffering and formatting up to you.
<P>
In general, you should not mix input or output from low-level I/O with that
from stream I/O. The only way to communicate between stream I/O and low-level
I/O is by using the fdopen or fileno functions.
<P>
The low-level I/O functions include: ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
<BR>
│ access      │ dup2       │ fstat      │ _setmode     │
<BR>
│ chmod      │ __eof      │ isatty      │ _sopen      │
<BR>
│ _chsize     │ fdopen      │ lseek      │ stat       │
<BR>
│ close      │ _filelength   │ open       │ _tell      │
<BR>
│ creat      │ fileno      │ read       │ umask      │
<BR>
│ dup       │         │         │ write      │
<BR>
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
<BR>

<P>
When you use the low-level I/O functions, you should be aware of the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A handle is a value that identifies a file. It is
created by the system and used by low-level I/O functions. For<I> The Developer's
Toolkit</I>, the handle returned by low-level I/O functions like open (called
the<I> C_handle</I>) is the same as that returned by DosOpen (called the
<I>API_handle</I>). As a result, you can get a file handle using the low-level
I/O functions, and then use it with OS/2 APIs.
<P>
<B>Portability Note </B> Other compilers may map the file handle so that
the<I> C_handle</I> and<I> API_handle</I> are different. If you will be
compiling your programs with other compilers, do not write code that depends
on the file handles being the same.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
You can pass handles between library environments without restriction. If
you acquire a handle other than by using<I> The Developer's Toolkit</I> library
functions open, creat, _sopen, or fileno, you must run _setmode for that
handle before you use it with other<I> The Developer's Toolkit</I> library
functions.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The default open-sharing
mode is SH_DENYWR. Use _sopen to obtain other sharing modes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Text
mode deletes '\r' characters on input and changes '\n' to '\r\n' on output.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>In a multithread environment,
you must ensure that two threads do not attempt to perform low-level I/O
operations on the same file at the same time. You must make sure that one
I/O process is completed before another begins</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>If
the file mode is text, the low-level I/O functions treat the character 'x1a'
in the following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If it is detected in a nonseekable file, 'x1a' is
treated as end-of-file. In a seekable file, it is treated as end-of-file
only if it is the last character.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->If a file is opened as text with either the O_APPEND
or O_RDWR flags and 'x1a' is the last character of the file, the last character
of the file is deleted.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
