<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Description
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ungetwc pushes the wide character by<I> wc</I> back onto the input<I> stream</I>.
The pushed-back wide characters will be returned by subsequent reads on
that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening
call (on the<I> stream</I>) to a file positioning function (fseek, fsetpos,
or rewind) discards any pushed-back wide characters for the stream.
<P>
The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged. There is
always at least one wide character of push-back.
<P>
If the value of<I> wc</I> is WEOF, the operation fails and the input stream
is unchanged.
<P>
A successful call to the ungetwc function clears the EOF indicator for the
stream. The value of the file position indicator for the stream after reading
or discarding all pushed-back wide characters is the same as it was before
the wide characters were pushed back.
<P>
For a text stream, the file position indicator is backed up by one wide
character. This affects ftell, fflush, fseek (with SEEK_CUR), and fgetpos.

<P>
For a binary stream, the position indicator is unspecified until all characters
are read or discarded, unless the last character is pushed back, in which
case the file position indicator is backed up by one wide character. This
affects ftell, fseek (with SEEK_CUR), fgetpos, and fflush.
<P>
After calling ungetwc, flush the buffer or reposition the stream pointer
before calling a read function for the stream, unless EOF has been reached.
After a read operation on the stream, flush the buffer or reposition the
stream pointer before calling ungetwc.

<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
This example reads in wide characters from stream, and then calls ungetwc
to push the characters back to the stream.
<PRE>#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   FILE         *stream;
   wint_t       wc;
   wint_t       wc2;
   unsigned int result = 0;

   if (NULL == (stream = fopen("ungetwc.dat", "r+"))) {
      printf("Unable to open file.\n");
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }

   while (WEOF != (wc = fgetwc(stream)) &amp;&amp; iswdigit(wc))
      result = result * 10 + wc - L'0';

   if (WEOF != wc)
      ungetwc(wc, stream);    /* Push the nondigit wide character back */

   /* get the pushed back character */
   if (WEOF != (wc2 = fgetwc(stream))) {
      if (wc != wc2) {
         printf("Subsequent fgetwc does not get the pushed back character.\n");
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
      printf("The digits read are '%i'\n"
             "The character being pushed back is '%lc'", result, wc2);
   }
   return 0;

   /****************************************************************************
      Assuming the file ungetwc.dat contains:

      12345ABCDE67890XYZ

      The output should be similar to :

      The digits read are '12345'
      The character being pushed back is 'A'
