A keyword used for defining the scope and linkage of variables and functions.
For internal variables, the variable has block scope and retains its value
between function calls. For external values, the variable has file scope
and retains its value within the source file. For class variables, the variable
is shared by all objects of the class and retains its value within the entire
program.
