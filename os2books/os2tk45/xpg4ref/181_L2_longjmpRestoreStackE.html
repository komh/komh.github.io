Syntax

void longjmp(jmp_buf <I>env</I>, int <I>value</I>);
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Description
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
longjmp restores a stack environment previously saved in<I> env</I> by setjmp.
setjmp and longjmp provide a way to perform a nonlocal goto. They are often
used in signal handlers.
<P>
A call to setjmp causes the current stack environment to be saved in<I> env</I>.
 A subsequent call to longjmp restores the saved environment and returns
control to a point in the program corresponding to the setjmp call.  Execution
resumes as if the setjmp call had just returned the given<I> value</I>.

<P>
All variables (except register variables) that are accessible to the function
that receives control contain the values they had when longjmp was called.
The values of variables that are allocated to registers by the compiler
are unpredictable. Because any auto variable could be allocated to a register
in optimized code, you should consider the values of all auto variables
to be unpredictable after a longjmp call.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Ensure that the function that calls setjmp does not return
before you call the corresponding longjmp function. Calling longjmp after
the function calling setjmp returns causes unpredictable program behavior.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>

<P>
The<I> value</I> argument must be nonzero. If you give a zero argument for
<I>value</I>, longjmp substitutes 1 in its place.
<P>
<B>C++ Considerations </B> When you call setjmp in a C++ program, ensure
that that part of the program does not also create C++ objects that need
to be destroyed. When you call longjmp, objects existing at the time of
the setjmp call will still exist, but any destructors called after setjmp
are not called. For example, given the following program:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>

<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

class A {
   int i;
   public:
      A(int I) {i = I; printf("Constructed at line %d\n", i);}
      ~A() {printf("Destroying object constructed at line %d\n",i);}
   };
jmp_buf jBuf;

int main(void) {
   A a1(__LINE__);
   if (!setjmp(jBuf)) {
     A a2(__LINE__);
     printf("Press y (and Enter) to longjmp; anything else to return norm
     char c = getchar();
     if (c == 'y')
        longjmp(jBuf, 1);
   }
   A a3(__LINE__);
   return 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
If you return normally, the output would be:
<PRE>Constructed at line 13
Constructed at line 15
Press y (and Enter) to longjmp; anything else to return normally
x
Destroying object constructed at line 15
Constructed at line 21
Destroying object constructed at line 21
Destroying object constructed at line 13
</PRE>

<P>
If you called longjmp, the output would be:
<PRE>Constructed at line 13
Constructed at line 15
Press y (and Enter) to longjmp; anything else to return normally
y
Constructed at line 21
Destroying object constructed at line 21
Destroying object constructed at line 13
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that the object from line 15 is not destroyed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Returns

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
longjmp does not use the normal function call and return mechanisms;  it
has no return value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Example Code
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
This example saves the stack environment at the statement:
<PRE>   if(setjmp(mark) != 0) ...
</PRE>

<P>
When the system first performs the if statement, it saves the environment
in mark and sets the condition to FALSE because setjmp returns a 0 when
it saves the environment. The program prints the message:
<PRE>   setjmp has been called
</PRE>

<P>
The subsequent call to function p tests for a local error condition, which
can cause it to call longjmp.  Then, control returns to the original setjmp
function using the environment saved in mark.  This time, the condition
is TRUE because -1 is the return value from longjmp. The example then performs
the statements in the block, prints longjmp has been called, calls recover,
and leaves the program.
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

jmp_buf mark;

int main(void)
{
   if (setjmp(mark) != 0) {
      printf("longjmp has been called\n");
      recover();
      exit(1);
   }
   printf("setjmp has been called\n");

   p();

   return 0;

   /****************************************************************************
      The output should be:

      setjmp has been called
      longjmp has been called
   ****************************************************************************/
}

int p(void)
{
   int error = 0;

   error = 9;

   if (error != 0)
      longjmp(mark, -1);

}

int recover(void)
