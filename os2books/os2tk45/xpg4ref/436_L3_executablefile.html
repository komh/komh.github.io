executable file
<P>
A regular file acceptable as a new process image file by the equivalent
of the<I> exec</I> family of functions, and thus usable as one form of a
utility. The standard utilities described as compilers can produce executable
files, but other unspecified methods of producing executable files may also
be provided. The internal format of an executable file is unspecified, but
a conforming application cannot assume an executable file is a text file.
