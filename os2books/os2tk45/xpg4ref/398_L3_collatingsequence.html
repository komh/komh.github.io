 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The relative ordering of collating elements as
determined by the setting of the LC_COLLATE category in the current locale.
The character order, as defined for the LC_COLLATE category in the current
locale, defines the relative order of all collating elements, such that
each element occupies a unique position in the order. This is the order
used in ranges of characters and collating elements in regular expressions
and pattern matching. In addition, the definition of the collating weights
of characters and collating elements uses collating elements to represent
their respective positions within the collation sequence.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
