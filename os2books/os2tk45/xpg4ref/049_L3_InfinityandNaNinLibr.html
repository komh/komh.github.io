<H1>Infinity and NaN in Library Functions</H1><!-- entering slot 49 -->
<P>
When the language level is set to extended which is the default, infinity
and NaN values can be passed as arguments to the scanf and printf families
of library functions, and to the string conversion and math functions. At
other language levels, these functions work as described in this book.
<P>
This section describes how the library functions handle the infinity and
NaN values.
