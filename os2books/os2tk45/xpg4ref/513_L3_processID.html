process ID
<P>
The unique identifier representing a process. A process ID is a positive
integer. (Under ISO only, it is a positive integer<I> that can be contained
in a pid_t</I>.) A process ID will not be reused by the system until the
process lifetime ends. In addition, if there exists a process group whose
process group ID is equal to that process ID, the process ID will not be
reused by the system until the process group lifetime ends. A process that
is not a system process will not have a process ID of 1.<I> X/Open</I>.
<I>ISO.1</I>.
