DBCS (double-byte character set)
<P>
A set of characters in which each character is represented by 2 bytes. Languages
such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, which contain more symbols than can
be represented by 256 code points, require double-byte character sets.
<P>
Because each character requires 2 bytes, the typing, display, and printing
of DBCS characters requires hardware and programs that support DBCS.<I> IBM</I>.
