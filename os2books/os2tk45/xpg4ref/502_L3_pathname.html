 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A string that is used to identify a file. A path
name consists of, at most, {PATH_MAX} bytes, including the terminating null
character.  It has an optional beginning slash, followed by zero or more
file names separated by slashes.  If the path name refers to a directory,
it may also have one or more trailing slashes.  Multiple successive slashes
are considered to be the same as one slash.  A path name that begins with
two successive slashes may be interpreted in an implementation-dependent
manner, although more than two leading slashes will be treated as a single
slash.  The interpretation of the path name is described in<I> pathname
resolution</I>.<I> ISO.1</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
