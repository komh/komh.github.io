<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Description
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>fgetws reads wide characters from the<I> stream
</I>into the array pointed to by<I> wcs</I>. At most,<I> n</I> - 1 wide
characters are read. fgetws stops reading characters after WEOF, or after
it reads a new-line wide character (which is retained). It adds a null wide
character immediately after the last wide character read into the array.

<P>
fgetws advances the file position unless there is an error. If an error
occurs, the file position is undefined.
<P>
The behavior of fgetws is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the current
locale. If you change the category between subsequent read operations on
the same stream, undefined results can occur.
<P>
After calling fgetws, flush the buffer or reposition the stream pointer
before calling a write function for the stream, unless WEOF has been reached.
After a write operation on the stream, flush the buffer or reposition the
stream pointer before calling fgetws.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Returns
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
If successful, fgetws returns a pointer to the wide-character string<I> wcs</I>.
If WEOF is encountered before any wide characters have been read into<I> wcs</I>,
the contents of<I> wcs</I> remain unchanged and fgetws returns a null pointer.
If WEOF is reached after data has already been read into the string buffer,
fgetws returns a pointer to the string buffer to indicate success. A subsequent
call would return NULL because WEOF would be reached without any data being
read.
<P>
If a read error occurs, the contents of<I> wcs</I> are indeterminate and
fgetws returns NULL. If an encoding error occurs (in converting a wide character
to a multibyte character), fgetws sets errno to EILSEQ and returns NULL.

<P>
If<I> n</I> equals 1, the<I> wcs</I> buffer has only room for the terminating
null character and nothing is read from the stream. (Such an operation is
still considered a read operation, so it cannot immediately follow a write
operation unless the buffer is flushed or the stream pointer repositioned
first.)
<P>
If<I> n</I> is greater than 1, fgetws fails only if an I/O error occurs
or if WEOF is reached before data is read from the stream. Use ferror and
feof to distinguish between a read error and a WEOF. WEOF is only reached
when an attempt is made to read past the last byte of data. Reading up to
and including the last byte of data does not turn on the WEOF indicator.

This example opens a file, reads in the file contents using fgetws, then
prints the file contents.

      exit(1);
   }

      if (EILSEQ == errno) {
         printf("An invalid wide character was encountered.\n");
         exit(1);
