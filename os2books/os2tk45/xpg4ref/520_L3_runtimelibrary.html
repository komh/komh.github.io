run-time library
<P>
A compiled collection of functions whose members can be referred to by an
application program during run time execution. Typically used to refer to
a dynamic library that is provided in object code, such that references
to the library are resolved during the linking step.  The run-time library
itself is not statically bound into the application modules.
