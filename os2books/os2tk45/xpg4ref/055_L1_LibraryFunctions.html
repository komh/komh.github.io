<P>
<I>The Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp Version 4</I> libraries are divided
into two parts:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Standard libraries, which define the SAA features
and<I> The Developer's Toolkit</I> standard extensions to SAA<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Subsystem libraries, which are a subset of the standard
libraries, and are used for subsystem development. The functions in these
libraries do not require a run-time environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This section lists alphabetically and describes all the functions that<I> The
Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp Version 4</I> product offers, including
the extensions to the ANSI/ISO C definition. For information on the subsystem
libraries and the functions in them, see the chapter called "Developing
Subsystems" in the<I> VisualAge C++ Programming Guide</I>.
<P>
Each function description includes the following subsections:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Syntax<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL> The prototyped declaration of the function
and the header file in which it is found. To include the declaration in
your code, include the header file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Description
<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL>A brief description of what the function does, what
parameters it takes, and how to use the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Returns
<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL>The value returned from a successful call to the
function and the error return value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Example Code
<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL>A short example of how to use the function. From
the online C Library Reference, you can use the IPF<B> Copy to File</B> choice
from the<B> Services</B> pull-down to copy a function example to a separate
file (called TEXT.TMP by default). You can then compile, link, and run the
example, or use the example code in your own source files.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Related
Information<!-- lm: 0x11 7 -->
<UL> A list of other functions that are similar
to or related to the function, and of other topics that provide additional
information that help you use the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
