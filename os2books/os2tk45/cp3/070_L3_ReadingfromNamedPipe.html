<H1>Reading from Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 74 -->
<P>
Both the server and the client processes read data from a pipe by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC -->DosRead</A>. The server reads from
the handle that was returned when it created the pipe with<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>,
and the client reads from the handle that was returned to it by<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.

<P>
When a pipe is created, the<I> PipeMode</I> parameter is used to specify
both the<I> pipe type</I> and the<I> read mode</I> for the server end of
the pipe:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A byte pipe can be read-only in byte-read mode. (<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC -->DosCreateNPipe
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 30 --> DosSetNPHState</A> return
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER if message-read mode is specified for a byte pipe.)
In byte-read mode, all currently available data is returned, up to the buffer
size specified by<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A message pipe can be read in either byte-read mode
or message-read mode, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->When a message pipe is read in byte-read mode, the
message headers are skipped, and the pipe is read as if it were a byte pipe.
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->When a message pipe is read in message-read mode,
each message is read either in its entirety, or not at all, depending on
the size of the message and the buffer length:<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>
<P>
--<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>If the buffer length that was specified for<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead
</A>is larger than the next available message, then only that message is
read, and the Bytes-Read parameter indicates the size of the message.<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
</UL> --<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>If
the buffer length for<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead</A> is
smaller than the next available message,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead
</A>returns the number of bytes requested and ERROR_MORE_DATA. Subsequent
calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead</A> are blocked until
the rest of the message can be transferred. (<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC -->DosPeekNPipe
</A>can be used to find out how many bytes are left in the message.)<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<I> PipeMode</I> parameter of DosCreateNPipe also specifies the<I> blocking
mode</I> for the server end of the pipe:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If nonblocking mode was specified,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead
</A>returns immediately with 0 in the Bytes-Read parameter if no data is
available.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If blocking mode was specified,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F --> DosRead
</A>blocks until data is available; the only time it will return with 0
in the Bytes-Read parameter is if it reaches end-of-file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 2F -->DosRead</A> works the same for both
ends of the pipe. However, the read mode and blocking mode are not necessarily
the same for the client end of the pipe as they are for the server end,
because<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 2D --> DosOpen</A> always opens the
CLIENT end in byte-read mode and blocking mode.
<P>
The read mode and blocking mode for either end of the pipe can be changed
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC --> DosSetNPHState</A>. The
pipe type, however, is always the same for both the server and client ends
of the pipe, and it cannot be changed.
