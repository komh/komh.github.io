<H1>Obtaining Information about Queues and Queue Elements</H1><!-- entering slot 133 -->
<P>
Any thread in the process that owns the queue can use<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 0E --> DosPeekQueue
</A>to examine the elements in the queue to determine which one to actually
read. Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 0E --> DosPeekQueue</A> returns
the identifier of the next element in the queue, so the function can be
called repeatedly to move through the queue. The identifier of the desired
element can then be supplied to<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>.

<P>
Any process that has opened a queue can use<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C3 0F --> DosQueryQueue
</A>to determine the number of elements in the queue. This function also
returns an error value if the queue owner has closed the queue.
