<H1>Using Unnamed Giveable Shared Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 30 -->
<P>
A process allocates unnamed giveable shared memory by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 27 --> DosAllocSharedMem
</A>with the object name (pszName parameter) set to NULL and the memory
options (flag parameter) set to OBJ_GIVEABLE. The process allocating the
memory must pass a pointer to the shared memory to another process. This
is typically done by using some form of interprocess communication, such
as a queue or a named pipe.
<P>
If a process allocates shared memory with the OBJ_GIVEABLE option, this
process can validate the pointer in another process with<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C3 FC --> DosGiveSharedMem</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment allocates 24576 bytes (24KB) of unnamed giveable
shared memory:
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    APIRET  ulrc;
    PBYTE   pb;

    ulrc = DosAllocSharedMem((PVOID *) &amp;pb,
                             (PSZ) NULL,
                             24576,        /* amount of memory */
                             fALLOC |
                             OBJ_GIVEABLE); /* giveable memory */

</PRE>

<P>
Once the memory is allocated, the allocating process can pass the memory
pointer to a second process through interprocess communication. The second
process need not use<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C3 FC --> DosGetSharedMem</A>;
the second process can just use the shared memory.
