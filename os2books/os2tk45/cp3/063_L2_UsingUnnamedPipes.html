<P>
Unnamed pipes are useful in applications that transfer data between related
processes. They are commonly used to control the input and output of child
processes by redirecting the standard input and output of the child process
to a pipe controlled by the parent process.

<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
