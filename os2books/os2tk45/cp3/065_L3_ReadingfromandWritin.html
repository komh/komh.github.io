<H1>Reading from and Writing to Unnamed Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 66 -->
<P>
Applications use the OS/2 file system functions to read from and write to
unnamed pipes.
<P>
The handles returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C3 23 --> DosCreatePipe
</A>are used as file handles to<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 25 --> DosRead
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.
<P>
To write (or add data) to an unnamed pipe, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>,
specifying the write handle of the pipe in<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>'s
file handle parameter.<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite</A> requests
to a pipe are processed in the order in which they are made. Multiple calls
to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite</A> can be made before
data is read (or removed) from the pipe. When the pipe becomes full, write
requests are blocked until space is freed by read requests.
<P>
When the pipe is too full to hold the entire contents of the write request,
the portion that will fit is written to the pipe before the writer is blocked.

<P>
To read from a pipe, call<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>,
specifying the read handle of the pipe in<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>'s
file handle parameter. Subsequent calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 25 --> DosRead
</A>can empty the pipe if no further calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite
</A>are made in the meantime.
<P>
Different threads writing to and reading from a pipe are not synchronized.
It is possible for the pipe reader to obtain partial contents of a write
request if the pipe becomes full during the write request.
<P>
If the process reading the pipe ends, the next<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite
</A>request for that pipe returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.
<P>
Calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 22 --> DosClose</A> terminates access
to an unnamed pipe. However, the pipe is not deleted from memory until all
handles to the pipe have been closed, including any handles that were defined
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C3 FC --> DosDupHandle</A>.
