<H1>Synchronizing Named Pipe Dialogs</H1><!-- entering slot 76 -->
<P>
Communicating processes can synchronize their named pipe dialogs by calling
DosResetBuffer after each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.

<P>
When used with external files, DosResetBuffer flushes the buffer cache of
the requesting process to disk. When used with named pipes, this function
blocks the calling process at one end of the pipe until the data the calling
process has written to the pipe has been successfully read at the other
end of the pipe.
