<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 5C -->DosQueryNPHState</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 5D --> DosQueryNPipeInfo
</A>can be used to obtain information about named pipes.
<P>
<B><A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 5C -->DosQueryNPHState</A></B>
<BR>
A client process can read data from the pipe, write data to the pipe, or
both, depending on the access mode specified when the pipe was created.
To check the current access mode, the client process can call<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 FC --> DosQueryNPHState</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment shows how to use<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 5C --> DosQueryNPHState
</A>to obtain information about a named pipe:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSNMPIPES   /* Named-pipe values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HPIPE    hpHandle;            /* Pipe handle       */
    ULONG    ulPipeHandleState;   /* Pipe-handle state */
    APIRET   ulrc;                /* Return code       */

    ulrc = DosQueryNPHState(hpHandle, &amp;ulPipeHandleState);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosQueryNPHState error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return,<I> PipeHandleState</I> will contain information that
describes the nature of the named pipe.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 5C -->DosQueryNPHState</A> returns the following
information about the pipe handle and the attributes of the pipe:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The end of the pipe that the handle is for (server
or client end)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The pipe type (byte pipe or message pipe)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The instance count<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The blocking mode (blocking or nonblocking)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The read mode (byte-read mode or message-read mode)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The values for pipe type and instance count cannot be changed, so they are
always the same as those that were specified when the pipe was created with
<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC -->DosCreateNPipe</A>. The information
returned for blocking mode and read mode, however, can come from different
sources:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the handle is for the server end of the pipe, then
the blocking mode and the read mode were set with<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>,
but could have been reset with<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC --> DosSetNPHState</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the handle is for the client end of the pipe, then
the blocking mode and the read mode were set to "blocking" and "byte-read"
by the system when the client called<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.
However, again, they could have been reset with<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC --> DosSetNPHState</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The pipe attributes are described in more detail in <A HREF="068_L3_CreatingNamedPipes.html">Creating
Named Pipes</A>.
<P>
An application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 5E --> DosSetNPHState
</A>to change the wait mode and the read mode. The pipe cannot be changed
to no-wait mode when another thread is blocked on a read or write operation
to the same end of the pipe.
<P>
<B>DosQueryNPipeInfo</B> More detailed information about a named pipe can
be obtained by using<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 FC --> DosQueryNPipeInfo</A>.
This function returns information in a<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C4 9D --> PIPEINFO
</A>data structure that includes the name of the pipe, the current and maximum
instance counts (the current number of pipes and the maximum number of times
the pipe can be created), the size of the input and output buffers for the
pipe, and the pipe identifier of the client process.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to use<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 FC --> DosQueryNPipeInfo</A>:

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSNMPIPES   /* Named-pipe values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HPIPE    hpHandle;          /* Pipe handle                     */
    ULONG    ulInfoLevel;       /* Pipe data required              */
    PIPEINFO pipInfoBuf;        /* Pipe information data structure */
    ULONG    ulInfoBufSize;     /* Pipe data-buffer size           */
    APIRET   ulrc;              /* Return code                     */

    ulInfoLevel = 1;                    /* Ask for standard level of pipe info */

    ulInfoBufSize = sizeof(PIPEINFO);   /* Length of pipe info data structure  */

    ulrc = DosQueryNPipeInfo(hpHandle,
                             ulInfoLevel,
                             &amp;pipInfoBuf,
                             ulInfoBufSize);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosQueryNPipeInfo error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return, the pipe information data structure contains a set
of information describing the nature and the current state of the named
pipe.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 5D -->DosQueryNPipeInfo</A> returns level
1 or level 2 file information for the pipe. Level 1 information includes
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The actual sizes of the in-buffer and out-buffer<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The maximum number of pipe instances permitted<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The current number of pipe instances<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The length of the pipe name<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The ASCIIZ name of the pipe, including \\<I>ComputerName
</I>if the pipe is in a remote computer system.
<P>
Level 2 information consists of a unique 2-byte identifier for each of the
pipe's client processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
