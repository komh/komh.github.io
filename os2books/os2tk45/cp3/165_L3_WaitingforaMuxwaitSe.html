<H1>Waiting for a Muxwait Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 175 -->
<P>
A thread can wait on a muxwait semaphore by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 FC --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
Any thread in the process that created a muxwait semaphore can wait for
the semaphore to clear by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 FC --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 FC --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment waits for a muxwait semaphore to clear. Assume
that the handle of the semaphore has been placed into<I> hmux</I> already.
<I>ulTimeout</I> is the number of milliseconds that the calling thread will
wait for the muxwait semaphore to clear. If the specified muxwait semaphore
is not cleared during this time interval, the request times out.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HMUX     hmux;      /* Muxwait semaphore handle              */
    ULONG    ulTimeout; /* Number of milliseconds to wait        */
    ULONG    ulUser;    /* User field for the semaphore that was */
                        /* posted or released (returned)         */
    APIRET   ulrc;      /* Return code                           */

    ulTimeout = 60000;  /* Wait for a maximum of 1 minute        */

    ulrc = DosWaitMuxWaitSem(hmux,
                             ulTimeout,
                             &amp;ulUser);

    if (ulrc == ERROR_TIMEOUT) {
        printf("DosWaitMuxWaitSem call timed out");
        return;
    }

    if (ulrc == ERROR_INTERRUPT) {
        printf("DosWaitMuxWaitSem call was interrupted");
        return;
    }

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosWaitMuxWaitSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return, the<I> ulUser</I> variable contains the user identifier
of the semaphore that caused the wait to terminate. If the caller had to
wait for all the semaphores within the muxwait semaphore to clear, then
the value corresponds to the last semaphore within the muxwait semaphore
to clear. If the caller had to wait for any semaphore with the muxwait semaphore
to clear, then the value corresponds to that semaphore.
<P>
An application can use the DCMW_WAIT_ANY flag in<A><!-- external link: 1D 70 C3 4F --> DosCreateMuxWaitSem
</A>to block a thread until any one of the event or mutex semaphores included
in the muxwait semaphore is posted or released. If the muxwait semaphore
refers to mutex semaphores, the thread only gains ownership of the one mutex
semaphore that was released.
<P>
An application can use the DCMW_WAIT_ALL flag in<A><!-- external link: 1D 70 C3 4F --> DosCreateMuxWaitSem
</A>to block a thread until all of the event or mutex semaphores included
in the muxwait semaphore are posted or released. If the muxwait semaphore
refers to mutex semaphores, the thread does not gain ownership of any of
the mutex semaphores until they are all released. When all are released,
the thread becomes owner of all the mutex semaphores included in the muxwait
semaphore. If the muxwait semaphore refers to event semaphores, the thread
will not run until all of the event semaphores are in the posted state at
the same time. This is because event semaphores in a muxwait list are<I> level-triggered</I>,
unlike individual event semaphores, which are edge-triggered.
<P>
For example, suppose that a thread is waiting for five event semaphores
in a muxwait list to be posted. The first semaphore is posted and then reset.
Next, the remaining semaphores are all posted, and they remain in the posted
state. The thread that is waiting for the muxwait semaphore will not run
until the first semaphore is posted again.
<P>
If an application specifies the DCMW_WAIT_ANY flag when the semaphore is
created,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A> returns
the programmer-defined identifier of the semaphore that is subsequently
posted or released. If an application specifies the DCMW_WAIT_ALL flag,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 -->DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A> returns the
programmer-defined identifier of the last semaphore that was posted or released.

<P>
The<I> ulTimeout</I> parameter places a limit on the amount of time a thread
blocks on a<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A> request.
If the time limit is reached before the semaphore has cleared, ERROR_TIMEOUT
is returned. If SEM_IMMEDIATE_RETURN is specified as the time limit,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>returns without blocking the thread. The thread can then go on to perform
other operations and call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>again later to wait for the event or mutex semaphores in the muxwait
list to be posted or released. If a time limit of SEM_INDEFINITE_WAIT is
specified, the thread waits (is blocked) indefinitely. If the thread is
unblocked by an external event while it is waiting for the muxwait semaphore
(as when a "no wait" I/O request has just been completed),<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 52 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>returns ERROR_INTERRUPT.
<P>
When a thread is waiting for any one of the semaphores in a muxwait list
to be posted or released, the semaphores are checked in the order in which
they are defined in the list.
<P>
<B>Waiting for Multiple Event Semaphores</B>
<BR>
The following information pertains only to muxwait semaphores that<!-- entering slot 176 --> consist
of multiple<I> event</I> semaphores:
<P>
Unlike individual event semaphores, which are edge-triggered, event semaphores
in a muxwait list are<I> level-triggered</I>. This means that if a thread
is waiting for all of the event semaphores in the muxwait list, it will
not run until all of the event semaphores are in the posted state at the
same time.
<P>
For example, a thread is waiting for five event semaphores in a muxwait
list to be posted. The first semaphore is posted and then reset. Next, the
remaining semaphores are all posted, and they remain in the posted state.
The thread that is waiting for the muxwait semaphore will not run until
the first semaphore is posted again.
<P>
<B>Waiting for Multiple Mutex Semaphores</B>
<BR>
The following information pertains only to muxwait semaphores that consist
of multiple<I> mutex</I> semaphores:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a thread is waiting for all of the mutex semaphores
in a muxwait list to be released, it does not receive ownership of any of
the semaphores until all of the semaphores have been released.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a thread is waiting for any one of the mutex semaphores
in a muxwait list, then the thread gains ownership only of the first mutex
semaphore that is released. The ownership of all other mutex semaphores
in the muxwait list remains unchanged.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If two threads have the same priority, then a thread
that is waiting for a mutex semaphore in a muxwait list takes precedence
over a thread that has requested ownership of only the individual semaphore,
provided all other mutex semaphores in the muxwait list have been released.
For example, a mutex semaphore that is part of a muxwait semaphore is released.
One thread has requested ownership of that single mutex semaphore, and another
thread with the same priority is waiting for the muxwait semaphore that
contains the same mutex semaphore. If all of the other mutex semaphores
in the muxwait list are<I> unowned</I> and ready to be given to the muxwait
semaphore, then the thread that is waiting for the muxwait semaphore will
run first.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the owners of any of the mutex semaphores in the
muxwait semaphore list have ended without releasing them, ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED
is returned. The thread must then call<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 20 --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem
</A>to obtain the records of all the semaphores in the muxwait list. Next,
the thread must call<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 1F --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>for each mutex semaphore in the muxwait-semaphore list so that it can
determine which semaphores are in the<I> Owner Died</I> state.
<P>
Each mutex semaphore that returns ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED from the query should
be closed by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
Also, because semaphore handles can be reused, the mutex semaphores that
are closed should be deleted from the muxwait-semaphore list by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC -->DosDeleteMuxWaitSem</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If any of the mutex semaphores in the muxwait list
are owned by the calling thread, ERROR_MUTEX_OWNED is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
