<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 19 -->DosTransactNPipe</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 15 --> DosCallNPipe
</A>facilitate the use of named pipes by combining other named pipe functions.
Compared to calling the other functions separately,<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 19 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 15 --> DosCallNPipe</A> provide significant
performance gains for applications that operate in a networked environment.
 They can also be used by local processes. However, both of these functions
can be used only with duplex message pipes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

and is referred to as a<I> procedure call</I>. It provides an efficient
means of implementing local and remote procedure call interfaces between
processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
