<H1>Committing and Decommitting Page Ranges</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
If an application allocates a sparse memory object, no physical memory location
is committed for the object. Memory in a sparse object must be committed
before it can be used.<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 4E --> DosSetMem</A> is
used to commit or decommit a range of previously allocated pages in a private
or shared memory object. Applications can make specific address ranges within
a memory object valid or invalid. Commitment and decommitment always take
place in multiples of one or more pages.
<P>
Applications can also use<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 4E --> DosSetMem
</A>to change the access protection attributes of a range of pages within
a memory object.
<P>
The following code fragment requests allocation of 2MB of uncommitted memory
and then commits 4096 bytes of the memory:
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    APIRET  ulrc;
    PBYTE   pb;

    /* Allocate 16KB object */
    ulrc = DosAllocMem((PVOID *) &amp;pb,
                       2097152,
                       PAG_READ |
                       PAG_WRITE);

    /* Commit 4KB           */
    ulrc = DosSetMem(pb,
                     4096,
                     PAG_COMMIT |
                     PAG_DEFAULT);

</PRE>

<P>
An application can also allocate a large committed object and then decommit
portions of it as they are no longer needed. Decommitment, like commitment,
is done on page boundaries; an application can decommit no less than a 4096
byte page.
<P>
The following code fragment allocates 16384 bytes of committed memory and
then decommits the first 4096 bytes of the memory:
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    APIRET  ulrc;
    PBYTE   pb;

    ulrc = DosAllocMem((PVOID *) &amp;pb,
                       16384,
                       fALLOC);    /* Allocate 16 K object */

    ulrc = DosSetMem(pb,
                     4096,
                     PAG_DECOMMIT);            /* Decommit 4KB         */

</PRE>

<P>
After memory is decommitted, an attempt to access the decommitted memory
will cause a protection violation.
<P>
You cannot pass an argument that crosses multiple memory objects. The function
will return an error.
