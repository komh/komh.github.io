<P>
An application can use an event semaphore to trigger execution of other
processes. This is useful if, for example, one process provides data to
many other processes. Using an event semaphore frees the other process from
the trouble of polling to determine when new data is available.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
