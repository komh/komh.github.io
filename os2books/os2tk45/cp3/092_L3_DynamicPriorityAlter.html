<H1>Dynamic Priority Alteration</H1><!-- entering slot 96 -->
<P>
OS/2 can be configured to dynamically alter the priority of a process. The
PRIORITY statement in CONFIG.SYS can be set to either ABSOLUTE or DYNAMIC.
If PRIORITY specifies the ABSOLUTE option, all processes receive CPU time
based on the priority established by calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> DosSetPriority</A>.
If the PRIORITY command in the CONFIG.SYS file specifies the DYNAMIC option,
OS/2 adjusts process priorities based on system load and process activity,
and on whether the process is in the foreground. DYNAMIC is the default
setting; if the PRIORITY command is not specified, the system uses DYNAMIC
priority. DYNAMIC is designed to gives the best overall system performance
under most conditions.
<P>
When dynamic priority variation is enabled, OS/2 grants higher priority
to the foreground process than to background processes. System load and
process activity are also taken into consideration. The priority of the
process consists of a computed priority value that is based upon the display
status of the process (foreground or background), and its recent I/O and
CPU time usage history. When dynamic priority variation is enabled, I/O
priority boosts are generated for keyboard input, window, foreground, processor
starvation, device I/O, and DOS Session interrupts. This ensures that the
foreground process-the process most likely to be in use-receives enough
CPU time to provide quick response to user input.
<P>
There are times when dynamic priority variation can interfere with a multi-threaded
application's execution.  For example, if you are doing a lot of keyboard
input on a thread, its priority will get boosted and other threads may not
get enough CPU time.  A communication thread is an example of a time sensitive
background thread which would be one case.  The solution is to either set
PRIORITY = ABSOLUTE or to call<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 33 --> DosSetPriority
</A>on a regular basis to keep the threads priority at the desired level.
