<H1>About Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 55 -->A<I> pipe</I> is a named or unnamed buffer used
to pass data between processes. A process writes to or reads from a pipe
as if the pipe were standard input or standard output. A parent process
can use pipes to control the input that a child process receives and to
receive the output that the child process produces.
<P>
There are two types of pipes-named and unnamed.
