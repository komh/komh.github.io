<H1>Process Exit Lists</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
Because any process can end any other process for which it has a process
identifier, applications might lose information if a process ends the application
before it can save its work. To prevent this loss of data, you can create
a list of functions to clean up data and files before OS/2 ends the process.
This list is called an<I> exit list</I>. OS/2 maintains an exit list for
each process and calls these functions whenever the application is ended,
whether by another process or by itself.
<P>
You call<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 1F --> DosExitList</A> to add to
the exit list a routine that is to be given control when a process is ended
(or finishes its execution). Multiple routines can be added to the list.
When the process is ending, OS/2 transfers control to each address on the
list.
<P>
Exit-list functions perform clean-up operations on resources. For example,
an exit-list function can be used in a dynamic link library module to free
resources or clear flags and semaphores when a client program has ended.
