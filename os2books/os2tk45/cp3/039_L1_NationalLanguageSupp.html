<P>
Many applications need to be independent of a particular language. Rather
than being hard-coded in English, they want to support, for example, an
English version of the application, and a French version, and a German version;
preferably without having to change the program code for each version. Meeting
this requirement is simplified through the use of such resources as string
tables, menu templates, dialog templates, accelerator tables, and through
the use of code pages.
<P>
This chapter describes the functions an application uses to be<I> NLS enabled</I>,
or language independent.
