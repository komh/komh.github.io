<H1>Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 57 -->
<P>
Named pipes enable related or unrelated processes on either the same computer
system or different systems to communicate with each other. Any process
that knows the name of a pipe can open and use a named pipe. In addition,
named pipe data can be transparently redirected across a network, such as
a local area network (LAN). (Unnamed pipes, by contrast, can be used only
by related processes that are on the same computer system.)
<P>
One process (the<I> server process</I>) creates the pipe and connects to
one end of it. Other processes that access the named pipe are called<I> client
processes</I>; they connect to the other end of the pipe. The server and
client processes can then pass data back and forth by reading from and writing
to the pipe. The server process controls access to the named pipe.
<P>
The client process can be either local or remote. A local client process
is one that runs on the same computer system as the server process. A remote
client process runs on a different system and communicates with the server
process across a local area network (LAN).
<P>
When the server process creates a named pipe with<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>,
it must specify the direction that data will flow through the pipe. The
process specifies an inbound pipe if it intends to read data from the client
process, an outbound pipe if it intends to write data to the client process,
or a duplex pipe if it intends to read from and write to the client process.

<P>
The server process also specifies whether data passes through the pipe as
bytes or messages. A message is a block of data, with a system-supplied
header, that is read or written as a single unit. The server and client
processes define the size and format of a message.
<P>
The server process also specifies whether child processes will inherit the
named pipe and how information will be read from and written to the pipe.
If the server specifies wait mode,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 38 --> DosRead
</A>will be blocked (it will not return to the process) until data is available
in the pipe, and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 39 --> DosWrite</A> will
be blocked until there is enough room in the pipe to contain the entire
data buffer. If the server specifies no-wait mode, reading from an empty
pipe or writing to a full pipe immediately returns an error value.
<P>
A named pipe consists of two pipe buffers, one for each direction of communication.
However, each end of the pipe has only one handle associated with it. The
server receives the handle for its end when it creates the pipe with<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>.
The client receives the handle for its end when it opens the pipe with<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.

<P>
The server and the client use their respective handles both to read from
the pipe and to write to it. (This is in contrast to unnamed pipes, for
which both the server and the client read from one handle and write to another.)
In other words, data that is written by the process at one end of the pipe
is read by the process at the other end.
<P>
A named pipe can have multiple instances, up to the number specified when
the pipe is first created. Pipe instances are actually separate pipes-that
is, unique sets of pipe buffers with unique handles-that share the same
name. The ability to create multiple pipe instances enables the server to
communicate with multiple client processes at the same time.
