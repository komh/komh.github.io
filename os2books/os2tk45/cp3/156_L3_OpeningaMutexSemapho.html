<H1>Opening a Mutex Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 164 -->
<P>
All of the threads belonging to the process that creates a mutex semaphore
have immediate access to the semaphore. Threads in other processes must
request access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 2D --> DosOpenMutexSem
</A>before they can use the semaphore in other mutex semaphore functions.

<P>
Access to system resources is granted on a per-process basis. Therefore,
a semaphore that has been opened by one thread in a process is open to all
other threads in that process as well.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 2D -->DosOpenMutexSem</A> merely provides
access to a mutex semaphore. To request ownership of a mutex semaphore,
a thread must call<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 FC --> DosRequestMutexSem</A>.

<P>
When a process no longer requires access to a mutex semaphore, it should
close the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
However, if a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore
is closed by OS/2.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC --> DosOpenMutexSem</A>.
increments the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to
1 when the semaphore is created and is decremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted by the system.

<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 2D --> DosOpenMutexSem</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
can be nested, but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535.
If an attempt is made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.

<P>
If a process ends without releasing a mutex semaphore that it owns, any
other thread that subsequently tries to open the semaphore will receive
ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED. This return code indicates that the owning process
ended abnormally, leaving the protected resource in an indeterminate state.
However, the semaphore is still opened for the calling thread, enabling
the thread to call<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 2E --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>to find out which process ended without releasing the semaphore. The
thread can then take appropriate action concerning the semaphore and the
protected resource.
