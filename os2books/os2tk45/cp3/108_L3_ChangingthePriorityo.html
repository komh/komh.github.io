<H1>Changing the Priority of a Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority</A> to
change the execution priority of threads in a process. The execution priority
defines when or how often a thread receives an execution time slice. Threads
with higher priorities receive time slices before those with lower priorities.
When a thread that is higher in priority than the currently running thread
becomes ready to run, it immediately preempts the lower priority thread
(the lower priority thread does not get to complete its time slice). Threads
with equal priority receive time slices in a round-robin order. If you raise
the priority of a thread, the thread is executed more frequently.
<P>
You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority</A> to
set the priority for one thread in a process, for all threads in a process
(and thus the process itself), or for threads in a child process.
<P>
A process can change the priority of any thread within itself. When a process
changes the priority of threads in a descendant process, however, only those
with default priorities are changed. The priority of any thread in a descendant
process that has already explicitly changed its priority from the default
with<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority</A> is not changed.

<P>
In the following code fragment,<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority
</A>lowers the priority of a process to be used as a background process:

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    PTIB ptib;    /* thread information block          */
    PPIB ppib;    /* process information block         */
    APIRET rc;    /* return code from DosGetInfoBlocks */

    rc = DosGetInfoBlocks(&amp;ptib,
                          &amp;ppib);

    DosSetPriority(PRTYS_PROCESSTREE,
                   PRTYC_IDLETIME,
                   0,
                   ppib-&gt;pib_ulpid);

</PRE>

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 93 C3 3D -->DosGetInfoBlocks</A> retrieves the
process information blocks and thread information blocks.<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority
</A>then uses the process identifier to change the priority to idle time
(idle-time processes receive the least attention by OS/2).
<P>
If you specify PRTYS_PROCESS when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> DosSetPriority</A>,
only the priority of the specified process changes. The priorities of all
child processes remain unchanged.
<P>
If you specify PRTYS_THREAD in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> DosSetPriority</A>,
you must specify a thread identifier as the last parameter.  The priority
of the specified thread changes, but the priorities of all other threads
in the process remain unchanged.
<P>
Whenever<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3F --> DosSetPriority</A> is called
with a class specification, but no value is specified for priority-delta,
the base priority level defaults to 0.
