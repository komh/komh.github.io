<H1>Creating a Mutex Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 163 -->
<P>
Mutex semaphores are created by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 6F C3 FC --> DosCreateMutexSem</A>.
This function also opens the semaphore for the calling process and its threads.

<P>
When a mutex semaphore is created, a flag is set to specify the initial
state of the semaphore, owned or unowned. If the semaphore is owned by a
thread, other threads requesting the semaphore are blocked. If the semaphore
is unowned-not owned by any thread- then any thread requesting ownership
will be granted ownership immediately.
<P>
If the calling thread sets the initial state to owned, it owns the semaphore
as soon as OS/2 creates the semaphore and can proceed to access the resource
that the semaphore was created to protect.
<P>
If the semaphore is unowned, any thread in the creating process can subsequently
request ownership of the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 FC --> DosRequestMutexSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can gain ownership of the semaphore, but they
must call<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 3A --> DosOpenMutexSem</A> to acquire
access to the semaphore before they can call<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 FC --> DosRequestMutexSem</A>.

<P>
Mutex semaphores can be defined as either private or shared.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Private semaphores are always unnamed and are therefore
identified by their handles. They can be used only by threads within a single
process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Shared semaphores can be either named or unnamed.
If named, they can be opened using either the name or the handle. The handle
returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 3A --> DosOpenMutexSem</A> is
then used to identify the semaphore for all other functions. Semaphore names
must include the prefix \SEM32\ and must conform to file system naming conventions.
Shared semaphores can be used by threads in multiple processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following code fragment creates a mutex semaphore:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HMTX hmtxProtFile;

    DosCreateMutexSem("\\sem32\\ProtFile",          /* Named-shared semaphore */
                      &amp;hmtxProtFile,
                      0,
                      FALSE);                       /* Initially unowned      */
        .
        .    /* Get data to write to shared file. */
        .

</PRE>

<P>
There is a system-wide limit of 65536 shared semaphores (including mutex,
event, and muxwait semaphores); in addition, each process can have up to
65536 private semaphores.
<P>
OS/2 maintains a usage count for each semaphore.<A><!-- external link: 1D 6F C3 39 --> DosCreateMutexSem
</A>initializes the usage count to 1. Thereafter, each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 3A --> DosOpenMutexSem
</A>increments the count, and each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 38 --> DosCloseMutexSem
</A>decrements it.
