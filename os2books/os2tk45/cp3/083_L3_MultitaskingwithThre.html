<H1>Multitasking with Threads and Multitasking with Processes</H1><!-- entering slot 87 -->
<P>
The creation and termination of a process is relatively slow compared to
the creation and termination of a thread, and is more costly in terms of
system resources.
<P>
For example, sharing data and resources between processes requires shared
memory and the mechanisms of interprocess communication; threads, on the
other hand, have full access to the memory and other resources that belong
to the process the threads are part of and can be coordinated using semaphores.
For these reasons, thread-to-thread task context switches are faster than
process-to-process context switches.
<P>
Because OS/2 can create and execute threads more quickly than processes,
the preferred multitasking method for applications is to distribute tasks
among threads in the same process instead of among processes.
