<H1>Unnamed Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 56 -->
<P>
An unnamed pipe is a circular buffer in memory. The buffer has<I> in</I> and
<I>out</I> pointers that are maintained by the system.
<P>
An unnamed pipe can transfer information only between related processes.
A child process started by a parent process with<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 24 --> DosExecPgm
</A>inherits the handles to any unnamed pipes created by its parent. This
inheritance enables the parent process and the child process to use the
unnamed pipe to communicate with one another. This type of pipe is typically
used to redirect the standard input and standard output of a child process.

<P>
To do this, a process opens a pipe and duplicates the read and write handles
of the pipe as the standard input and standard output files for the child
process. Once the handles are duplicated, the parent process can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 24 --> DosExecPgm
</A>to start the child process. When the child process reads and writes
to its standard input and standard output handles, it is reading and writing
to the pipe. The parent process can also communicate with the child process
through the pipe.
<P>
Using an unnamed pipe, a text editor could run another program, such as
a compiler or assembler, and display the output of the compiler or assembler
within the editor.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C3 23 -->DosCreatePipe</A> creates an unnamed
pipe. This function returns two file handles for the pipe, one for writing
to the pipe and another for reading from the pipe. A process can then write
to the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite</A> and
read from the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>.

<P>
A pipe exists until both handles are closed. The order in which the handles
are closed is sometimes important. For example,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 26 --> DosWrite
</A>might wait for data to be read from the pipe before completing its operation.
In this case, the read handle is closed before the write handle is closed,
writing to the pipe generates an error.
<P>
No control or permission mechanisms or checks are performed on operations
to unnamed pipes.
