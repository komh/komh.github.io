<H1>Waiting for a Thread to End</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->
<P>
An application might need to ensure that one thread has finished executing
before another thread continues with its own task. For example, one thread
might have to finish reading a disk file into memory before another thread
can use the information. You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 35 --> DosWaitThread
</A>to suspend a thread until another thread has ended.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 35 -->DosWaitThread</A> places the current
thread into a wait state until another thread in the current process has
ended. It then returns the thread identifier of the ending thread.
<P>
The following code fragment creates three threads. The thread identifier
for each thread is returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 33 --> DosCreateThread
</A>in the<I> atid</I> array. Using<I> &amp;atid[0]</I> as a parameter in
the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 35 --> DosWaitThread</A> causes
OS/2 to wait until the thread with that identifier (the thread running Thread2Func)
ends.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define HF_STDOUT 1           /* Standard output handle    */

    TID tidAtid[3];
    ULONG ulWritten;

    DosCreateThread(&amp;tidAtid[0],
                    Thread2Func,
                    0,
                    0,
                    4096);

    DosCreateThread(&amp;tidAtid[1],
                    Thread3Func,
                    0,
                    0,
                    4096);

    DosCreateThread(&amp;tidAtid[2],
                    Thread4Func,
                    0,
                    0,
                    4096);

    DosWaitThread(&amp;tidAtid[0],
                  DCWW_WAIT);

    DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
             "The thread has ended\r\n",
             27,
             &amp;ulWritten);

</PRE>

<P>
If you set the<I> tid</I> parameter to 0 in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 FC --> DosWaitThread</A>,
OS/2 waits only until the next thread (any thread in the process) ends.
The identifier for the ended thread is then returned in the<I> tid</I> parameter.

<P>
After the threads are created as in the preceding example, the following
code fragment waits until one of the threads ends, and then returns its
thread identifier:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    TID tid;

    tid = 0;

    DosWaitThread(&amp;tid,
                  DCWW_WAIT);

</PRE>

<P>
The thread identifier of the next thread to end after the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 35 --> DosWaitThread
</A>call is returned in the<I> tid</I> parameter.
<P>
You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0E C4 35 --> DosWaitThread</A> so that
you can recover thread resources when the thread ends, or to synchronize
the execution of a thread with the execution of other threads.
