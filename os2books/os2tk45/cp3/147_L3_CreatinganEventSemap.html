<H1>Creating an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 155 -->
<P>
Processes create an event semaphore by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>.
The process that controls the event or resource is usually the one that
creates the semaphore, but it does not have to be.
<P>
Threads in the process that creates the semaphore do not have to open the
semaphore before using it.<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 3F --> DosCreateEventSem
</A>obtains access to the semaphore for the calling process and its threads.
Threads in other processes must call<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem
</A>to open the semaphore before they can use it.
<P>
Event semaphores can be defined as either private or shared:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Private semaphores are always unnamed and are therefore
always identified by their handles. They can be used only by threads within
a single process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Shared semaphores can be either named or unnamed.
If named, they can be opened using either the name or the handle. The handle
returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem</A> is
then used to identify the semaphore for all other functions. Semaphore names
must include the prefix \SEM32\ and must conform to file system naming conventions.
Shared semaphores can be used by threads in multiple processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In the following code fragment, the controlling process creates a named
event semaphore and posts the semaphore after writing data to a shared file:

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HEV hevWriteEvent;

    DosCreateEventSem("\\sem32\\wrtevent",          /* Named-shared semaphore */
                       &amp;hevWriteEvent, 0, FALSE);   /* Initially reset        */
        .
        .
        /* Write data to shared file. */
        .
        .
    DosPostEventSem(hevWriteEvent);                 /* Posts the event        */
        .
        .    /* Continue execution. */
        .
</PRE>

<P>
There is a system-wide limit of 65536 (64K) shared semaphores (including
mutex, event, and muxwait semaphores); in addition, each process can have
up to 65536 (64K) private semaphores.
<P>
When an event semaphore is created, a flag is used to specify the initial
state of the event semaphore, either reset or posted. If the initial state
is reset, a thread that calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 43 --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>will be blocked until a process that has access to the semaphore uses
<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 41 -->DosPostEventSem</A> to post the event
semaphore. If the initial state is posted, then a thread that calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 43 --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>will return immediately to continue its execution. If the thread calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 43 -->DosWaitEventSem</A> is not in the
process that created the semaphore, the thread must open the semaphore with
<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 -->DosOpenEventSem</A> before calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC -->DosWaitEventSem</A>.
<P>
OS/2 maintains a usage count for each semaphore.<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 3F --> DosCreateEventSem
</A>initializes the usage count to 1. Thereafter, each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem
</A>increments the count, and each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 3E --> DosCloseEventSem
</A>decrements it.
