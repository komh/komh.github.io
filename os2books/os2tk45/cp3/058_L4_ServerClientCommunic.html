<H1>Server-Client Communications Using Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 58 -->
<P>
A server process initiates a connection to a client process by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> DosConnectNPipe</A>.
Once the pipe has been connected by the server process, the client process
must open the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 52 --> DosOpen
</A>to complete the connection. If no client process has opened the pipe
when the server process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> DosConnectNPipe</A>,
the function either waits until a client opens the pipe or returns ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED,
depending on whether the server process created the pipe to wait for data.

<P>
Each client process requires a separate instance of a pipe. For example,
if a server process creates a named pipe and specifies that four instances
of the pipe can be created, the process can then create three more instances
of the named pipe (for a total of four pipes, including the original). Each
instance has the same name, but each has a unique pipe handle. The process
can then connect each pipe to the server. (Each instance must be connected
by an explicit use of<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> DosConnectNPipe</A>.)
In this example, the server must use each function four times to create
and connect four separate instances of the named pipe. Each pipe is then
available to a separate client process.
<P>
If a client process receives the ERROR_PIPE_BUSY return value from<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>,
no instances of the given pipe are available. The process can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0D C4 58 --> DosWaitNPipe
</A>to wait for an instance to become available. The function waits until
an instance is free or until the specified time interval elapses. When an
instance becomes free, the process can open the pipe. If several processes
are waiting for an instance to become available, the system gives the named
pipe to the process that has been waiting the longest.
<P>
The server process can disconnect a client process from a pipe by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 FC -->DosDisConnectNPipe</A>. Ideally, the
client process closes the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 4F --> DosClose
</A>before the server process disconnects the pipe. If the client process
has not closed the pipe when the server process disconnects it, the server
process forces the pipe closed and the client process subsequently receives
errors if it attempts to access the pipe. Note that forcing the closure
of the pipe might discard data in the pipe before the client process has
had an opportunity to read it.
<P>
A process can read and write bytes to a named pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 55 --> DosRead
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>. A process can
read or write messages by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 FC --> DosTransactNPipe</A>.
Depending on the access mode,<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 57 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>writes a message to the pipe, reads a message from the pipe, or both.
If a named pipe contains unread data or is not a message pipe,<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 57 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>fails.
<P>
Named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_INBOUND or NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND access
mode cannot use the<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 57 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>function. If the named pipe's client uses the<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 57 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>function, the function returns error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).
<P>
If it is reading from the pipe,<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 57 --> DosTransactNPipe
</A>does not return until a complete message is read, even if the server
process specified no-wait mode when the pipe was created.
<P>
A process can also read data from a named pipe without removing the data
from the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC --> DosPeekNPipe</A>.
This function copies the specified number of bytes from the pipe and returns
the number of bytes of data left in the pipe and the number of bytes left
in the current message, if any.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 53 -->DosPeekNPipe</A> also returns the
state of the pipe. A named pipe can be in one of the following states:

<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 4E -->DosCallNPipe</A> is used to open,
write to, read from, and close a named message-format pipe.
<P>
Named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_INBOUND or NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND access
mode cannot use the<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 4E --> DosCallNPipe</A> function.
If the named pipe's client uses the<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 4E --> DosCallNPipe
</A>function, the function returns error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED). This
function is equivalent to calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 FC -->DosTransactNPipe</A>, and<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 4F --> DosClose
</A>If no instances of the pipe are available,<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 4E --> DosCallNPipe
</A>waits for an instance or returns without opening the pipe if the specified
interval of time elapses.
<P>
A process can retrieve information about the handle state of a named pipe
by using<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 FC --> DosQueryNPHState</A>. The
handle state is a combination of the instance count, the access mode, and
the pipe type (byte or message).<A><!-- external link: 1D CC C3 54 --> DosQueryNPHState
</A>also specifies whether the process owning the handle is a server or
client and whether the pipe waits if reading and writing cannot proceed.

<P>
A process can modify the handle state of a named pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC --> DosSetNPHState</A>.
For example, the process can change the reading mode for the pipe,<!-- entering slot 59 --> enabling
a process to read bytes from the pipe instead of messages.
