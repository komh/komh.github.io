<H1>Queues and Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 130 -->
<P>
If a process manages only one queue, it typically waits for an element to
become available. However, if a process manages several queues, waiting
for one queue means that other queues cannot be read. To avoid wasting time
while waiting, a process can supply an event semaphore when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 12 --> DosReadQueue
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 FC --> DosPeekQueue</A>. The process
can then continue to execute without actually reading an element from the
queue, because<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 14 --> DosWriteQueue</A> will
post the semaphore only when an element is ready. The semaphore remains
posted until someone resets it; usually  the queue owner process resets
the semaphore after it reads all the available information from the queue.

<P>
If a process uses a unique semaphore for each queue, it can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 13 --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>to wait for the first queue to receive an element.
<P>
Only one semaphore is permitted per queue.
