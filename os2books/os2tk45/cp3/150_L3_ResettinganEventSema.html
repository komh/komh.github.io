<H1>Resetting an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 158 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 3E -->DosResetEventSem</A> resets an event
semaphore if it is not already reset, and returns the number of times the
semaphore was posted since it was last reset. All threads that subsequently
call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 40 --> DosWaitEventSem</A> for this
semaphore will be blocked.
<P>
Any thread belonging to the process that created the event semaphore can
change the state of the semaphore to reset by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.

<P>
When an event semaphore is in the reset state, any thread that calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 40 --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>to wait for the semaphore will be blocked. When the event semaphore
is posted, all of the threads that are waiting for the semaphore are released
to continue execution.
<P>
The following code fragment resets an event semaphore. Assume that the handle
of the semaphore has been placed into<I><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 4F --> HEV
</A></I>already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HEV     hev;        /* Event semaphore handle                        */
    ULONG   ulPostCt;   /* Post count for the event semaphore (returned) */
    APIRET  ulrc;       /* Return code                                   */

    ulrc = DosResetEventSem(hev, &amp;ulPostCt);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosResetEventSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 3E -->DosResetEventSem</A> returns the post
count of the event semaphore and resets the post count to 0. The post count
is the number of times the semaphore has been posted (using<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 FC --> DosPostEventSem</A>)
since the last time the semaphore was in the reset state. (An event semaphore
can be reset when it is created, as well as by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.)
The post count can also be obtained by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 FC --> DosQueryEventSem</A>.

<P>
If the event semaphore is already reset when<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 3E --> DosResetEventSem
</A>is called, ERROR_ALREADY_RESET is returned, along with a post count
of 0. The semaphore is not reset a second time.
