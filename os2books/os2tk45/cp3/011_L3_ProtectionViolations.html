<H1>Protection Violations</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
OS/2 fully utilizes the memory protection capabilities of the 80386 microprocessor.
OS/2 grants an application access to a memory object only if the object
has been explicitly allocated by the application or made available for use
by the application.
<P>
If an application attempts to access memory that it is not assigned, the
system interrupts the application and executes the exception handling routine
for protection violations. Protection violations can be handled by the application
(in its own exception handling routines) or by OS/2. If the protection violation
is handled by the operating system, the system exception handling routine
determines the cause of the exception, displays an error message, and then
terminates the application.
<P>
It is usually not possible for an application to recover from a protection
violation. Therefore, programmers should ensure that all pointers are valid.
Because protection violations commonly occur during application debugging,
each message displayed for a protection violation includes the contents
of the registers when the violation occurred. If the violation occurred
as a result of passing an invalid pointer to a memory function, an error
code is returned by the memory function.
<P>
In earlier versions of OS/2, protection violations could be used to find
bugs when an application accessed memory that was not allocated to the application.
This approach will no longer work because memory objects can be larger than
the size requested by the application because the memory objects are allocated
on 4KB page boundaries. For example, a pointer to the 513th byte of a 512
byte memory object is valid and does not cause a protection violation. This
means that programmers cannot always rely on protection violations to spot
memory addressing errors.
