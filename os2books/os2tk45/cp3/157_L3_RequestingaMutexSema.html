<H1>Requesting a Mutex Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 165 -->
<P>
In order to access a shared resource, a process must own the mutex semaphore
that is protecting the shared resource. Ownership is obtained by first opening
the mutex semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC --> DosOpenMutexSem</A>,
then using<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem</A> to
request ownership of the semaphore. If another process already owns the
semaphore, the requesting process is blocked. If the semaphore is not owned,
OS/2 grants ownership to the requesting process and the process can access
the shared resource. When the process is finished using the shared resource,
it uses<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E --> DosReleaseMutexSem</A> to
relinquish its ownership of the semaphore, thereby enabling another process
to gain ownership.
<P>
A process can gain ownership of a mutex semaphore in three ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The thread that creates a mutex semaphore can
designate itself as the owner by setting a flag when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 6F C3 FC --> DosCreateMutexSem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any thread in the process that created the semaphore
can request ownership by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 FC --> DosRequestMutexSem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A thread in another process must request access
to the semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 4D --> DosOpenMutexSem
</A>before it can call<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 FC --> DosRequestMutexSem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that ownership of a mutex semaphore is given only to the requesting
thread; it is not shared by other threads in the same process.
<P>
If a mutex semaphore is unowned,<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>sets it as<I> owned</I> and returns immediately to the caller. If the
semaphore is already owned, the calling thread is blocked until either the
owning thread calls<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E --> DosReleaseMutexSem
</A>to release the semaphore, or a specified time limit is reached.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how a process opens a mutex semaphore,
requests it, and, after writing to the shared file, releases and closes
the semaphore:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HMTX hmtxProtFile;

    DosOpenMutexSem("\\sem32\\ProtFile",
                    &amp;hmtxProtFile);           /* Opens for this process    */

    DosRequestMutexSem(hmtxProtFile,
                       5000);                 /* Returns in 5 seconds if   */
        .                                     /* Ownership not obtained    */
        .
        .                                     /* Write data to shared file */
        .
        .
    DosReleaseMutexSem(hmtxProtFile);         /* Releases ownership        */
        .
        .                                     /* Continue execution        */
        .
        .
    DosCloseMutexSem(hmtxProtFile);           /* Finished with shared file */

</PRE>

<P>
If more than one thread is blocked on a<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>request, the thread with the highest priority level is the first to
be unblocked and given ownership of the semaphore. If more than 1 of the
waiting threads have the same priority level, then FIFO ordering is used
to determine which thread is unblocked and given ownership.
<P>
The<I> time-out</I> parameter (5000 milliseconds in the example above) places
a limit on the amount of time a thread blocks on a<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>request. If the time limit is reached before the thread gains ownership
of the semaphore, ERROR_TIMEOUT is returned. If SEM_IMMEDIATE_RETURN is
specified for the time limit,<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>returns without blocking the thread. The thread can then perform other
operations and call<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>again later if it still requires access to the protected resource. If
SEM_INDEFINITE_WAIT is specified for the time limit, the thread waits indefinitely.
If the thread is unblocked by an external event while it is waiting for
the mutex semaphore (as when a<I> No Wait</I> I/O request has just been
completed), ERROR_INTERRUPT is returned to the caller.
<P>
In addition to the usage count that OS/2 maintains for all semaphores, OS/2
maintains a request count for each mutex semaphore. Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>increments the count, and each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E --> DosReleaseMutexSem
</A>decrements it.
<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E -->DosReleaseMutexSem</A> can be nested,
but the request count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535. If an attempt
is made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_SEM_REQUESTS is returned.
When calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E -->DosReleaseMutexSem</A> are nested,
a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 4E --> DosReleaseMutexSem</A> merely
decrements the request count for the semaphore; the semaphore is not actually
released to another thread until its request count is 0. If a process ends
while it owns a mutex semaphore, all of the currently blocked<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 4F --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>requests, as well as any<!-- entering slot 166 --> future requests for
the semaphore, return ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED. This return code indicates that
the owning process ended abnormally, leaving the protected resource in an
indeterminate state. An application that receives this error should close
the mutex semaphore (so that it can be deleted from OS/2), because it is
no longer valid. Appropriate action should also be taken concerning the
protected resource.
