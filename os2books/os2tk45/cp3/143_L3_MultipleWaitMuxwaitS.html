<P>
A multiple wait (muxwait) semaphore enables a thread to wait on several
event or mutex semaphores simultaneously. A muxwait semaphore is a compound
semaphore that consists of a list of up to 64 event semaphores or mutex
semaphores (the two types cannot be mixed).
<P>
A flag is set when the muxwait semaphore is created to enable threads to
use the semaphore in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Threads can wait for all of the mutex semaphores to
be released, or for all of the event semaphores to be posted.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Threads can wait for any one of the mutex semaphores
in the list to be released, or for any one of the event semaphores in the
list to be posted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Depending on the value of the flag, a muxwait semaphore is said to have
cleared when either any or all of the semaphores in the muxwait list have
been posted or released.
<P>
For example, suppose a thread requires access to several regions of shared
memory at the same time. OS/2 blocks the thread until the thread acquires
ownership of all the mutex semaphores protecting the shared regions. The
thread can then access all the memory regions. Meanwhile, OS/2 prevents
access by other threads.
