<H1>Memory Suballocation and Using Heaps</H1><!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
There are times when a process requires only small amounts of memory rather
than an entire memory object. It would be wasteful to allocate an entire
page of memory when only a few bytes are necessary, so a mechanism is provided
for applications to allocate a large block of memory and then suballocate
portions of the memory as necessary to fulfill small requests from an application.
This is done by creating a heap.
<P>
A<I> heap</I> is a region of storage within a memory object from which an
application can allocate blocks of memory. A<I> memory block</I> is a piece
of memory within a heap. The size of the memory block is rounded up to the
next higher multiple of 8 bytes.
<P>
Because OS/2 allocates a 4KB page for each memory allocation, using a heap
to suballocate amounts of memory smaller than 4KB is more efficient than
using<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 FC --> DosAllocMem</A>.
<P>
When an application creates a heap, it can have OS/2 track the committing
and decommitting of memory within the heap. When the application commits
and decommits memory itself, it has to keep track of the access state of
each page as they are accessed.
<P>
Applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 31 --> DosSubSetMem</A> to
initialize a memory object for suballocation, then use<A><!-- external link: 1D FF C3 2F --> DosSubAllocMem
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 00 C4 30 --> DosSubFreeMem</A> to allocate
and free the memory.
<P>
Memory is still committed in pages when an application uses suballocation.
If the application suballocates 512 bytes, 4096 bytes will be committed.
Accessing the 513th byte will not cause a protection violation, but you
could be accessing memory that was suballocated by another thread in the
process.
