<P>
A parent process can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 --> DosWaitChild
</A>to determine the termination status of a child process that is running
independently. The parent process can have one of its threads call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 --> DosWaitChild
</A>to wait for completion of the child process while other threads of the
parent continue processing.
<P>
If the child has started another process,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 --> DosWaitChild
</A>waits for the completion of any grandchild processes before returning,
but does not report their status. If the specified child process has multiple
threads,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 --> DosWaitChild</A> returns
the result code of the last<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 13 --> DosExit
</A>request.
<P>
If there are no child processes, either active or ended with a return code,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 -->DosWaitChild</A> returns with an error
code. If no child processes have ended,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 14 --> DosWaitChild
</A>can optionally wait until one ends before returning to the parent.
