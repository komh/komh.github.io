Communication between processes is valuable in a multitasking operating
system to enable concurrent processes to work together. Pipes are one of
three forms of interprocess communication (IPC), the other forms of IPC
being semaphores and queues.
<P>
This chapter describes how to create, manage, and use pipes. Pipes enable
two or more processes to communicate as if they were reading from and writing
to a file.
