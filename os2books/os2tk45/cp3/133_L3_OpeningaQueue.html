<H1>Opening a Queue</H1><!-- entering slot 139 -->
<P>
Once the queue is created, the server process of the queue and the threads
of the server process have immediate access to the queue and can proceed
to access the queue. A client process must request access to a queue by
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 FC --> DosOpenQueue</A>. Once the
queue is open, the client process can add an element to the queue with<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 FC --> DosWriteQueue</A>,
and it can query the number of elements in the queue with<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C3 FC --> DosQueryQueue</A>.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 3F -->DosOpenQueue</A> retrieves the queue
handle and the process identifier of the queue owner. The function also
increments the queue's access count.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how another process would open the queue
created with<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> DosCreateQueue</A>.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSQUEUES
    #include&lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define HF_STDOUT 1    /* Standard output handle */

    HQUEUE  hq;
    PID     pidOwner;
    ULONG   ulWritten;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpenQueue(&amp;pidOwner,
                        &amp;hq,
                        "\\queues\\sample.que");

    if (ulrc) {
        DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
                 "\r\n Queue open failed. \r\n",
                 24,
                 &amp;ulWritten);

        DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS,
                1);
    }
    else {
        DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
                 "\r\n Queue opened. \r\n",
                 19,
                 &amp;ulWritten);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
When it is finished with the queue, a thread in the client process ends
its access by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 FC --> DosCloseQueue</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 3C -->DosCloseQueue</A> decrements the access
count for the process each time it is called. When the access count reaches
0, the connection between the client process and the queue is terminated.

<P>
After a process has opened a queue, any thread in that process can access
the queue with equal authority.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a queue was created by a call to the 16-bit<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> DosCreateQueue</A>,
then it is not accessible to 32-bit<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 3F --> DosOpenQueue
</A>requests, and ERROR_QUE_PROC_NO_ACCESS will be returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
