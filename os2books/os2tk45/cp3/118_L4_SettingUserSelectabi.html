<H1>Setting User Selectability of a Child Session</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
A process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 38 --> DosSetSession</A> to
set the<I> selectability</I> of a child session.  When a child session is
selectable, the user can select it from the Window List or by using Alt+Esc.
When a child session is nonselectable, the user cannot select the session
from the Window List or move to it by using the Alt+Esc keys.
<P>
In the following code fragment,<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 38 --> DosSetSession
</A>makes a child session nonselectable:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #define INCL_DOSSESMGR
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    ULONG ulSessionID;
    STATUSDATA stsdata;

    stsdata.Length = sizeof(stsdata);
    stsdata.SelectInd = SET_SESSION_NON_SELECTABLE;  /* Non-selectable         */
    stsdata.BondInd = SET_SESSION_UNCHANGED;         /* Leaves session bonding */
                                                     /* index unchanged        */

    DosSetSession(ulSessionID,
                  &amp;stsdata);

</PRE>

<P>
Once a child session is made nonselectable, the user cannot select the session
from the Window List or move to it by using the Alt+Esc keys. However, the
parent session can still bring the child session to the foreground by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 FC -->DosSelectSession</A>. If the session
contains a Presentation Manager application or is a windowed session, the
user will still be able to select it with a mouse.
<P>
The parent session can make a nonselectable child session selectable by
setting the<I> SelectInd</I> field to SET_SESSION_SELECTABLE in the<A><!-- external link: 1D D3 C4 77 --> STATUSDATA
</A>structure.<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 38 --> DosSetSession</A> can
be called only by a parent session and only for a child session. That is,
the calling process must be the process that started the child session using
<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC -->DosStartSession</A>. Neither the parent
session itself nor any grandchild, nor any other descendant session beyond
a child session can be the target of this call.
<P>
Additionally,<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 38 --> DosSetSession</A> cannot
be used to change the status of a session that was started as an unrelated
session. The<I> Related</I> field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C4 74 --> STARTDATA
</A>structure must have been set to 1 when the session was started.
