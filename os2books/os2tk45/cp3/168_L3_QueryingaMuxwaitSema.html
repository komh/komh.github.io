<H1>Querying a Muxwait Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 179 -->
<P>
Processes use<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 2A --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem</A> to
obtain the semaph ore records for each of the semaphores included in the
muxwait semaphore.
<P>
Any thread in the process that created a muxwait semaphore can obtain information
about the semaphores in the muxwait list by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 FC --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also use this function, but they must first
gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
An application must provide this function with an array in which to store
the semaphore records. If the array is not large enough to hold all of the
semaphore records that are in the muxwait list, then ERROR_PARAM_TOO_SMALL
is returned, and the record-counting parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 2A --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem
</A>will contain the number of semaphore records that are in the muxwait
list. The calling thread can then allocate the correct amount of space and
call<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 2A --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem</A> again
with the correct amount of space for the list of records.
<P>
If the owner of any mutex semaphore in the muxwait-semaphore list has ended
without releasing the semaphore, the records of all the semaphores in the
list are still returned, but<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 2A --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem
</A>also returns ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED. The calling thread can call<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 29 --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>for each mutex semaphore in the muxwait-semaphore list so that it can
determine which semaphores are in the<I> Owner Died</I> state. The process
can then close the unowned mutex semaphores.
<P>
Each mutex semaphore that returns ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED from the query should
be closed by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
Also, because semaphore handles can be reused, the mutex semaphores that
are closed should be deleted from the muxwait-semaphore list by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC -->DosDeleteMuxWaitSem</A>.
<P>
If the specified muxwait semaphore does not exist, ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
is returned.
