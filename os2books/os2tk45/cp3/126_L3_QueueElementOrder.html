<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 0E -->DosReadQueue</A> reads either a specified
element or the first element in the queue. The first element in the queue
depends on the queue type, which is specified when the queue is created.
A queue can have FIFO, LIFO, or priority ordering.
<P>
Priority values range from 0 (lowest priority) through 15 (highest priority).
 The writing process assigns a priority to a queue element when the element
is written to the queue.<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 0E --> DosReadQueue
</A>reads elements from the queue in descending order of priority, regardless
of the order in which<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 0F --> DosWriteQueue
</A>placed the elements in the queue. Elements with equal priority are read
in FIFO order.
