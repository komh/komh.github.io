<H1>Priority Levels</H1><!-- entering slot 94 -->
<P>
Within each class, OS/2 maintains a priority level for a thread. For each
of the four priority classes, there are 32 priority levels-0 to 31. A thread
with priority level 31 always receives a time slice before a thread with
priority level 30, and so on.
<P>
If two or more threads have the same priority level, OS/2 distributes the
CPU time equally by using a<I> round-robin scheme</I>; that is, OS/2 gives
a time slice to first one, then another, and so on, and then goes back to
the first. A thread can use<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 48 --> DosSetPriority
</A>to change its own priority or the priority of any other thread within
its process.
<P>
Although an application can set the priority level of a thread at any time,
only applications that use more than one thread or process should do so.
The best use of priority is to speed up threads or processes on which other
threads or processes depend. For example, an application might temporarily
raise the priority of a thread loading a file if another thread is waiting
for that file to be loaded. Because the priority of a thread is relative
to all other threads in the system, raising the priority of the threads
in an application merely to get the extra CPU time adversely affects the
overall operation of the system.
<P>
There are other ways to affect the amount of CPU time a thread is given.
A thread can define a critical section of code by using DosEnterCritSec
and<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 FC --> DosExitCritSec</A>. While inside
the critical section of code, a thread cannot be preempted by any other
thread within its process (threads in other processes are still given their
time slices). Using critical sections enables threads to get more CPU time,
while not unduly affecting the rest of the system.
<P>
The priority class and priority level are set using<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> DosSetPriority</A>.
The priority class is changed by passing the new priority class to the function.
The priority level, however, is changed by passing a value, called the<I> priority-delta</I>,
that is added to the existing priority level to produce the new priority
level; changes to the priority level are relative to the current priority
level. Specifying a positive priority-delta increases the priority level,
enabling the thread to obtain more CPU time than it normally would. A negative
priority-delta decreases the priority level, giving the thread less CPU
time than it would normally receive. The value is restricted to the valid
range, based upon the current priority class of the process.
<P>
If you change the priority level without changing the priority class, the
priority-delta is relative to the current priority level. However, if you
change the priority class at the same time that you change the priority
level, the priority-delta value is relative to 0. Whenever<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 48 --> DosSetPriority
</A>is called with a class specification, but no value is specified for
priority-delta, the base priority level defaults to 0.
<P>
The process identifier parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 48 --> DosSetPriority
</A>specifies which process is affected by the call. A process can change
the priority of itself, of any process that is a descendant of itself, or
of one of its threads.
<P>
A thread can change the priority of any thread within its current process.
When a thread changes the priority of threads in a descendant process, however,
only those threads running at the default priority will be changed. You
cannot change the priority of a thread in a child process that has already
changed its priority from the default.
<P>
The initial thread of execution for an application is given a regular class
priority that varies by the system. When a thread is created, it is initially
dispatched in the same class and priority as the thread that started it.
A child process inherits the priority of the thread in the parent process
that creates it.
