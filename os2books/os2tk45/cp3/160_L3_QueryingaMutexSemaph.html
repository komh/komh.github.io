<H1>Querying a Mutex Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 169 -->
<P>
An application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 1B --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>to determine the current owner of a mutex semaphore and to obtain a
count of the number of requests on it. If the mutex semaphore is not owned,
the request count is 0.
<P>
Any thread in the process that created a mutex semaphore can obtain information
about the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 FC --> DosQueryMutexSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 FC --> DosQueryMutexSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC --> DosOpenMutexSem</A>.

<P>
If the mutex semaphore exists and is owned,<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 1B --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>returns the process and thread identifications of the owner, as well
as the request count for the semaphore. The request count is the number
of<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 1D --> DosRequestMutexSem</A> calls minus
the number of<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 1C --> DosReleaseMutexSem</A> calls
that have been made for the semaphore by the owning thread.
<P>
If<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 1B --> DosQueryMutexSem</A> returns a
request count of 0, the mutex semaphore is unowned.
<P>
If the owning process ended without calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>,
then ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED is returned, and the output parameters contain
information about the ended owning process.
