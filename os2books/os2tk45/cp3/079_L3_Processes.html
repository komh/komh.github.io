<P>
An OS/2 application that has been loaded into memory and prepared for execution
is called a process. As mentioned earlier, a process consists of the code,
data, and other resources (for example, open file handles) that belong to
the application. Each process has at least one thread, called the<I> main
thread</I> or<I> thread 1</I>.
<P>
When OS/2 runs an application, it confirms that the process code and data
are in memory and that the main thread's registers and stack are set before
starting the application. Each application has access to all resources of
the computer, such as memory, disk drives, screen, keyboard, and the CPU
itself. The system carefully manages these resources so that applications
can access them without conflict.
<P>
A process can have more than one thread. OS/2 creates the first thread of
execution for a process when it starts the executable file. More threads
can be created with<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 FC --> DosCreateThread</A>.
Each thread runs independently, with its own stack and register values.
Unless the application changes a thread's priority, each thread gets a slice
of the CPU in a round-robin strategy. All the threads in a process share
the application's globally defined variables and other resources (open file
handles, and so on).
<P>
A process or thread ends when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 FC --> DosExit</A>.
OS/2 automatically closes any files or other resources left open by the
process when the process ends. When a thread ends, however, any open resources
remain open until another thread closes them or the process ends. A process
can direct OS/2 to carry out other actions when the process ends, by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 38 -->DosExitList</A> to create a list of
termination functions. OS/2 calls the termination functions, in the order
given, when the process is about to end. If the thread has registered any
exception handlers, the exception handlers will also be called before the
thread ends.
