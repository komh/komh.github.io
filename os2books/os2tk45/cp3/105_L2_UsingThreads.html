<H1>Using Threads</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
A<I> thread</I> is a dispatchable unit of execution that consists of a set
of instructions, related CPU register values, and a stack. Every process
has at least one thread and can have many threads running at the same time.
The application runs when OS/2 gives control to a thread in the process.
The thread is the basic unit of execution scheduling.
<P>
Every process has at least one thread, called the<I> main thread</I> or
<I>thread 1</I>. To execute different parts of an application simultaneously,
you can start several threads.
<P>
A new thread inherits all the resources currently owned by the process.
This means that if you opened a file before creating the thread, the file
is available to the thread. Similarly, if the new thread creates or opens
a resource, such as another file, that resource is available to the other
threads in the process.
