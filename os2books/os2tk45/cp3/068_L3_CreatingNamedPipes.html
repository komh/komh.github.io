<H1>Creating Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 69 -->
<P>
The server process creates a named pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>.

<P>
To create a named pipe, specify on the<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 57 --> DosCreateNPipe
</A>function:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the pipe<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The access modes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The type of pipe (byte or message)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The sizes of the input and output buffers<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 57 -->DosCreateNPipe</A> returns a pipe
handle that can be used in subsequent pipe operations.
<P>
Each named pipe must have a unique name of the following form:
<PRE>    \PIPE\PipeName</PRE>

<P>
The "\PIPE\" in the name above is required, but need not be uppercase.  It
is not the name of a subdirectory.
<P>
To open a pipe on a remote computer, the client process must specify the
name of the server process that opened the pipe as part of the pipe name,
as follows:
<PRE>    \\Server\PIPE\PipeName
</PRE>

<P>
"\\Server" in the name above is the name of the remote computer; again,
"\PIPE\" is required.
<P>
The name parameter must conform to the rules for OS/2 file names, but no
actual file is created for the pipe.
<P>
Named pipes created with certain access modes prevent the named pipes' clients
from using certain functions. If the named pipe is created with access mode
NP_ACCESS_INBOUND, the named pipe's client cannot use these functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 FC -->DosCallNPipe
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 FC -->DosTransactNPipe
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC -->DosPeekNPipe
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>If the named pipe is created with access mode NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND, the
named pipe's client cannot use these functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 FC -->DosCallNPipe
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 FC -->DosTransactNPipe
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC -->DosWrite
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the named pipe's client uses an incorrect function, the function returns
error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).
<P>
In the following code fragment,<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 57 --> DosCreateNPipe
</A>creates a pipe named \pipe\pipe1 and supplies a unique handle identifying
the pipe.<I> OpenMode</I> is set to NP_ACCESS_DUPLEX. This activates full
duplex access to the named pipe. There will be no inheritance to child process,
and no write-through (write-through only affects remote pipes).<I> PipeMode
</I>is set to "NP_WMESG | NP_RMESG | 0x01". This specifies that the pipe
should be read as a message stream for both reading and writing and an instance
count of 1 (only one instance of the named pipe can be created at a time).
The pipe will block on Read/Write if no data is available.

<P>
Once the named pipe is created, the application can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 56 --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>to connect a client process to the pipe.
<P>
Once a client process<!-- entering slot 70 --> connects to the pipe, the
process can read from and write to the pipe. The preceding example creates
a byte pipe, so the process can use<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 55 --> DosRead
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 56 --> DosWrite</A> to read from
and write to the pipe.
<P>
After the client process finishes using the pipe, the server process can
disconnect the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 FC --> DosDisConnectNPipe</A>.
The server process can either connect again or close the named pipe by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC -->DosClose</A>.
<P>
When a server process creates a named pipe, it defines the pipe to the system
by specifying the file write-through mode, the inheritance mode, the access
and blocking modes, the pipe type, the read mode, the size of the in and
out buffers, and the instance count.  The following list describes these
modes, types, and buffers.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> file write-through mode</I> has significance
only for communication with remote client processes. When the file write-through
bit is set, data is sent across the network as soon as it is written; otherwise,
OS/2 will in some cases hold data briefly in a local buffer before sending
it across the network.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> inheritance mode</I> specifies whether or not
the pipe handle will be inherited by a child process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> access mode</I> specifies the direction in
which data will flow through the pipe. The server creates an inbound pipe
(a pipe with inbound access mode) if it intends to read data from the client
process, an outbound pipe if it intends to write data to the client process,
or a duplex pipe if it intends to both read from and write to the client
process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> blocking mode</I> specifies whether or not
<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 55 -->DosRead</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 56 --> DosWrite
</A>will block when no data is available to read, or there is no room to
write data.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> pipe type</I> is the form in which a stream
of data is written to the pipe. If the pipe is a byte pipe, the server and
client processes write data as an undifferentiated stream of bytes. If the
pipe is a message pipe, the processes write data as a stream of messages;
 messages are blocks of data, each with a system-supplied header, that are
written as single units. The server and client processes define the size
and format of a message.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> read mode</I> is the form in which data is
read from the pipe. The data in a pipe that was created as a byte pipe can
only be read as bytes; therefore, a byte pipe will always be in byte-read
mode. The data in a message pipe, however, can be read either as messages
or as bytes.  (If it is to be read as bytes,<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 55 --> DosRead
</A>skips over the message headers). Therefore, message pipes can be in
either message-read mode or byte-read mode.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The terms "byte pipe" and "message pipe" always refer to the
pipe type-the form in which data is written to the pipe. When the read mode
of a pipe is being referred to, it is always explicitly identified as either
message-read mode or byte-read mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
<I>in</I> and<I> out buffers</I> can be up to 64KB in size. If the pipe
will be read in message-read mode, and if the message size is known, the
server can control how many messages the buffer will hold at one time by
specifying the appropriate buffer size.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
<I>instance count</I> is the maximum number of instances of the named pipe
that can be created. A pipe instance is actually a separate pipe-that is,
a unique set of pipe buffers with unique handles. However, the term "pipe
instance" is used to distinguish pipes that share the same name from pipes
with different names. Because a client process uses only the name of the
pipe when opening it, the existence of multiple pipe instances is transparent
to a client process.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Creating Multiple Instances of a Named Pipe</B> Although each named pipe
must have a unique name, a server process can create multiple<I> instances
</I>of a pipe, all of which have the same name. A pipe instance is actually
a separate pipe-that is, a unique set of pipe buffers with unique handles.

<P>
The ability to create multiple pipe instances enables the server to communicate
with multiple client processes at the same time. Because a client process
uses only the name of the pipe when opening it, the existence of multiple
pipe instances is transparent to a client process.
<P>
The<I> ICount</I> parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 53 --> DosCreateNPipe
</A>specifies the maximum number of named pipe instances that can be created.
(An unlimited number can also be specified.) This parameter is specified
only when the first instance of a named pipe is created; any subsequent
attempt to redefine the instance count will be ignored.
<P>
If the instance count is greater than 1, the server process can create additional
pipe instances by specifying the same pipe name in subsequent calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>.
Generally, the attributes of the subsequent pipe instances are defined to
be the same as those of the original pipe instance, because a client process
that requests the pipe has no way of controlling which pipe instance will
be assigned to it.
<P>
After an additional pipe instance has been created, it is used in the same
manner as the original pipe instance.  That is, the same sequence of named
pipe functions is used in the control or management of all named pipe instances.
(See <A HREF="059_L4_StepsinManagingServe.html">Steps in Managing Server-Client
Transactions</A> for more<!-- entering slot 71 --> information.)
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If all of the instances of a named pipe are in use when a
client calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>, ERROR_PIPE_BUSY
is returned. However, the client can wait for an instance of that pipe to
become available by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 0D C4 FC --> DosWaitNPipe</A>.

<P>
Multiple instances of a named pipe can be created by different processes.
That is, multiple server processes can create and use instances of the same
named pipe to communicate with their clients.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
