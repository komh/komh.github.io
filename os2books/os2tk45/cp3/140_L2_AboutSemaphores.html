<H1>About Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>
<I>Semaphores</I> signal the beginning or ending of an operation and provide
mutually exclusive ownership of resources. Typically, semaphores are used
to prevent more than one process or thread within a process from accessing
a resource, such as shared memory, at the same time.
<P>
Semaphores are defined by OS/2 and reside in an internal memory buffer.
They are divided into three types, according to the functionality they provide:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Event semaphores</I> enable a thread to notify
waiting threads that an event has occurred. The waiting threads then resume
execution, performing operations that are dependent on the completion of
the signaled event.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Mutual exclusion (mutex) semaphores</I> enable
threads to serialize their access to shared resources. That is, ownership
of a mutex semaphore is used by cooperating threads as a prerequisite for
performing operations on a resource. (Threads cooperate by using the mutex
semaphore functions to ensure that access to the resource is mutually exclusive.)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Multiple wait (muxwait) semaphores</I> enable threads
to wait either for multiple events to occur, or for multiple resources to
become available. Alternatively, a flag can be set so that a thread waits
for any one of multiple events to occur, or for any one of multiple resources
to become available.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
