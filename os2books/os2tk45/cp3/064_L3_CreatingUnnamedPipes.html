<H1>Creating Unnamed Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 72 C3 38 -->DosCreatePipe</A> creates an unnamed
pipe. Two handles are returned: one for read access to the pipe and one
for write access. The pipe size specified is advisory; its actual size is
dependent on the amount of available memory. If the size parameter is 0,
the pipe is created with the default size, which is 512 bytes.
<P>
This example creates an unnamed pipe. The current process can use the unnamed
pipe for communication between itself and a child process.
<PRE>    #define INCL_BASE    /* Queue values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HFILE    hfReadHandle;    /* Pointer to the read handle      */
    HFILE    hfWriteHandle;   /* Pointer to the write handle     */
    ULONG    ulPipeSize;      /* Pipe size                       */
    APIRET   ulrc;            /* Return code                     */

    ulPipeSize = 4096;        /* Ask for 4KB of internal storage */
                              /* for the pipe                    */

    ulrc = DosCreatePipe(&amp;hfReadHandle,
                         &amp;hfWriteHandle,
                         ulPipeSize);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosCreatePipe error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return, the<I> ReadHandle</I> variable contains the read handle
for the pipe, and the<I> WriteHandle</I> variable contains the write handle
for the pipe.
<P>
After a process creates a pipe, any child process started with<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 39 --> DosExecPgm
</A>inherits the pipe handles. Using shared memory, the parent process can
pass one of the pipe handles to the child process; thus, one process can
store data in the pipe and the other can retrieve it.
