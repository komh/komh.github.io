<H1>Setting the Command Line and Environment for a Child Process</H1><!-- entering slot 102 -->
<P>
When you start a process, it inherits many of the resources of the parent.
This includes file handles, such as the standard input and standard output
files. A child process also inherits the resources of the screen group,
such as the mouse and video modes, and the environment variables of the
parent process.
<P>
The call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 35 --> DosExecPgm</A> determines
the command line and environment that the child process receives. The fourth
and fifth parameters of the function are pointers to the command line and
the environment, respectively. If these pointers are NULL, the child process
receives nothing for a command line and only an exact duplicate of the environment
of the parent process. The parent process can modify this information by
creating a string (ending with two NULL characters) and passing the address
of the string to the function. The command line string must include the
name of the application, followed by a NULL character, and the command line
arguments, followed by two NULL characters. Any number of arguments can
be passed to the child process, as long as the argument string ends with
two NULL characters.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment passes to the child process the string "test
-option1 -option2" as its command line:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS    /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    RESULTCODES resc;
    CHAR szFailName[CCHMAXPATH];

    CHAR szCommandLine[] = "test\0-option1 -option2\0";

    DosExecPgm(szFailName,          /* Object-name buffer  */
               sizeof(szFailName),  /* Length of buffer    */
               EXEC_SYNC,           /* Sync flag           */
               szCommandLine,       /* Argument string     */
               (PSZ) NULL,          /* Environment string  */
               &amp;resc,               /* Address of result   */
               "test.exe");         /* Name of application */
