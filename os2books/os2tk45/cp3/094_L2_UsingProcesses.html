<H1>Using Processes</H1><!-- entering slot 98 -->
<P>
An OS/2 application that has been loaded into memory and prepared for execution
is called a process. A<I> process</I> is the code, data, and other resources
of the application, such as the open file handles, semaphores, pipes, queues
and so on. OS/2 considers every application it loads to be a process.
<P>
Each process has at least one thread, called the<I> main thread</I> or<I> thread
1</I>. The application runs when the system scheduler gives control to a
thread in the process. For more on thread management, see <A HREF="105_L2_UsingThreads.html">Using
Threads</A>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
