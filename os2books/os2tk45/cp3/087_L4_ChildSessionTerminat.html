<H1>Child Session Termination</H1><!-- entering slot 91 -->
<P>
A parent session can stop a child session by using<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 FC --> DosStopSession</A>.
Stopping the child session ends the processes in that session. It also stops
any sessions related to the child session. If a child session is in the
foreground when it is stopped, the parent session becomes the foreground
session.<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 1B --> DosStopSession</A> breaks
any bond that exists between the parent session and the specified child
session.
<P>
A process running in the session specified in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 1B --> DosStopSession
</A>can ignore the request to end. If this happens,<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 1B --> DosStopSession
</A>still returns 0 (indicating success). The only way to be certain that
the child session has ended is to wait for notification through the termination
queue specified in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>.
OS/2 writes a data element into the specified queue when the child session
ends. The process in the parent session must call<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 19 --> DosReadQueue
</A>to retrieve this data element, which contains the session identifier
for the child session and the return value for the process in the child
session. Only the process that created the child session can read the data
element.
