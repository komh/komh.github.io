<H1>Reading from a Queue</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
The queue owner (server process) and its threads can read an element from
the queue by using<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>.
The owner can read the first element in the queue by specifying 0 as the
element number. Alternatively, the owner can read a particular element in
the queue by specifying an element code returned from<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 FC --> DosPeekQueue</A>.
This function is not available to client processes.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 -->DosReadQueue</A> can either remove
queue elements in the order that was specified when the queue was created
(FIFO, LIFO, or priority), or it can use an element identifier from<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 52 --> DosPeekQueue
</A>as input to remove a previously examined element.
<P>
The following code fragment reads an element from the queue. Assume that
the caller has placed the handle of the queue into<I> QueueHandle</I> already
and that the identifier of the process that owns the queue has been placed
into<I> OwningPID</I> already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSQUEUES   /* Queue values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HQUEUE        hqQueueHandle;   /* Queue handle                 */
    REQUESTDATA   rqRequest;       /* Request-identification data  */
    ULONG         ulDataLength;    /* Length of element received   */
    PULONG        pulDataAddress;  /* Address of element received  */
    ULONG         ulElementCode;   /* Request a particular element */
    BOOL32        bNoWait;         /* No wait if queue is empty    */
    BYTE          bElemPriority;   /* Priority of element received */
    HEV           hevSemHandle;    /* Semaphore handle             */
    PID           pidOwningPID;    /* PID of queue owner           */
    APIRET        ulrc;            /* Return code                  */

    rqRequest.pid = pidOwningPID;     /* Set request data block to indicate  */
                                      /* queue owner                         */

    ulElementCode = 0;                /* Indicate that the read should start */
                                      /* at the front of the queue           */

    bNoWait = 0;                      /* Indicate that the read should wait  */
                                      /* if the queue is currently empty     */

    hevSemHandle = 0;                 /* Unused since this is a call that    */
                                      /* waits synchronously                 */

    ulrc = DosReadQueue(hqQueueHandle,
                        &amp;rqRequest,
                        &amp;ulDataLength,
                        (PVOID *) &amp;pulDataAddress,
                        ulElementCode,
                        bNoWait,
                        &amp;bElemPriority,
                        hevSemHandle);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosReadQueue error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return,<I> DataLength</I> contains the size of the element
on the queue that is pointed to by the pointer within<I> DataAddress</I>,
<I>ElemPriority</I> has been updated to contain the priority of the queue
element pointed to by<I> DataAddress</I>, and<I> Request.ulData</I> contains
any special data that the<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 57 --> DosWriteQueue
</A>caller placed into the queue.
<P>
If the queue is empty and<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_WAIT (0), the calling
thread waits until an element is placed in the queue. If the queue is empty
and<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_NOWAIT (1),<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 --> DosReadQueue
</A>returns immediately with ERROR_QUE_EMPTY.
<P>
If<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_NOWAIT, an event semaphore must be provided
so that the calling thread can determine when an element has been placed
in the queue. The semaphore is created by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>,
and its handle is supplied as a<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 --> DosReadQueue
</A>parameter. The first time an event semaphore handle is supplied in a
<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 -->DosReadQueue</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 52 --> DosPeekQueue
</A>request for which DCWW_NOWAIT has been specified for a particular queue,
the handle is saved by the system. The same handle must be supplied in all
subsequent<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 --> DosReadQueue</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 52 --> DosPeekQueue
</A>requests that are called for that queue; if a different handle is supplied,
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.
<P>
When a client process adds an element to the queue, the system automatically
opens the semaphore (if necessary) and posts it. The server can either call
<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 53 -->DosQueryEventSem</A> periodically
to determine whether the semaphore has been posted, or it can call DosWaitEventSem.
DosWaitEventSem causes the calling thread to block until the semaphore is
posted.
<P>
After the event semaphore has been posted, the calling thread must call
<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 55 -->DosReadQueue</A> again to remove the
newly added queue element.
<P>
If QUE_CONVERT_ADDRESS is specified in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> DosCreateQueue</A>,
OS/2 will automatically convert 16-<!-- entering slot 142 -->bitaddressesto32
- bitaddresses .
