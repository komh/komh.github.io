<H1>About CPU Scheduling</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
OS/2 performs prioritized, preemptive, multitasking.<I> Prioritized</I> means
that OS/2 does not divide CPU time equally among all threads. All programs
do not get equal access to the CPU. A prioritizing, time-slicing strategy
is used to allocate access to the CPU among competing threads. Each thread
has a priority and OS/2 runs the highest priority thread that is ready to
run. Programs with higher priorities (a real-time robotic application, for
example), are given access to the CPU before programs with lower priorities.
If a thread with a higher priority than the currently running thread becomes
ready to run, the current thread is stopped immediately, or<I> preempted</I>,
and the higher priority thread is given the CPU. The lower priority thread
does not get to complete its time slice. Threads of equal priority are given
CPU time in a round-robin manner.
<P>
<I>Preemptive</I> means that the multitasking activity needs no cooperation
from the executing programs. OS/2 maintains control over executing programs,
and stops, or preempts, them when their time slice with the CPU is over
or when a higher priority program is ready to run.
<P>
CPU scheduling is based on four priority classes-Time Critical, Fixed-High,
Regular, and Idle-Time. Each class has 32 levels of execution ordering.
Scheduling parameters are user-selectable at the time the system is started
or can be varied dynamically based on system load.
<P>
Depending on a thread's priority class and level, OS/2 periodically gives
each thread in each process a small slice of CPU time. Threads with higher
priorities always run before threads having lower priorities. A thread runs
until its time is up or until a thread with a higher priority is ready to
run. At that time, OS/2 preempts the thread and starts another thread. Threads
can also voluntarily relinquish the CPU (for example, by calling DosSleep).

<P>
The amount of time in each time slice is defined by the TIMESLICE command
in the CONFIG.SYS file. The TIMESLICE command can be used by the user to
customize the size of the time slices that a thread gets. The default is
for OS/2 to dynamically vary the size of the time slice based on the activity
of the thread and the overall system load.
<P>
When a thread is created (using<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 FC --> DosCreateThread</A>),
it inherits the priority of the thread that started it.<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3E --> DosSetPriority
</A>enables threads to change their priority classes and levels in response
to changes in their execution environments.<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3E --> DosSetPriority
</A>enables a thread to change its own priority, or the priority of any
thread within its process.<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 3E --> DosSetPriority
</A>also enables changing priorities for the entire process and for descendant
processes. Within each class, the priority level of a thread can vary because
of a DosSetPriorty request or, if dynamic priority variation is being used,
because of action taken by OS/2.
