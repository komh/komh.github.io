<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D C6 C3 14 -->DosQueryMem</A> is used to obtain
information about a range of pages within the virtual address space of the
current process.
<P>
Each page in the virtual address space of a process is either free, private,
or shared.
<P>
Each page within a memory object can be in one of two states, either committed
or uncommitted.
<P>
A committed page has its access controlled by an access protection attribute.
These protection attributes are read protection (PAG_READ), write protection
(PAG_WRITE), execute protection (PAG_EXECUTE), and guard page protection
(PAG_GUARD).
