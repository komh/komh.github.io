<H1>Named Shared Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
Related processes generally use a single named shared memory object for
storing queue data.  The server process allocates the memory object by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC -->DosAllocSharedMem</A>. Care must be
taken to ensure that the memory object is large enough to meet application
requirements.
<P>
The name of the shared memory object is established by agreement among the
server and the client processes. For simplicity, the name can be the same
as the queue name, except that the prefix \SHAREMEM\ must be used instead
of \QUEUES\.
<P>
A client process accesses the named shared memory object by calling DosGetNamedSharedMem.
It must then call<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 18 --> DosOpenQueue</A> to
gain access to the queue of the server.
<P>
Before the server process ends, it releases the memory object by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 FC -->DosFreeMem</A>.
