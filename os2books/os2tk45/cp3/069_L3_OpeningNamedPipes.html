<H1>Opening Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 72 -->
<P>
A client process can open the client end of a named pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D -->DosOpen</A> opens the client end of
a pipe by name and returns a handle. The application must use the appropriate
pipe name and access modes to open the pipe for reading, writing, or both.
(To open a pipe on a remote computer, the client process must also specify
the name of the computer system as part of the pipe name, as follows:
<PRE>    \\ComputerName\PIPE\PipeName.)
</PRE>

<P>
If a pipe name includes a remote LAN server name,<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>attempts to open the pipe on a remote computer. The server process can
then read input from the client process through the pipe.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment opens a remote pipe, reads from the standard
input (usually the keyboard), and sends the information to the server process
through the pipe:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSQUEUES   /* Queue values          */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define PIPESIZE 256
    #define SERVER_PIPE_NAME "\\\\myserver\\pipe\\mypipe"
    #define HF_STDIN 0       /* Standard input handle */

    HPIPE   hp;
    BYTE    abBuf[PIPESIZE];
    ULONG   ulAction, ulRead, ulWritten;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosOpen(SERVER_PIPE_NAME,
                   &amp;hp,
                   &amp;ulAction,
                   0,
                   FILE_NORMAL,
                   FILE_OPEN,
                   OPEN_ACCESS_READWRITE |
                   OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE,
                   (PEAOP) NULL);

    if (ulrc)
        DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS,
                0);                    /* Open pipe failed      */

    do {                               /* Open pipe succeeded   */
        DosRead(HF_STDIN,
                abBuf,
                sizeof(abBuf),
                &amp;ulRead);

        DosWrite(hp,
                 abBuf,
                 ulRead,
                 &amp;ulWritten);     /* Writes to the pipe    */
    } while (ulRead &gt; 2);         /* Stop on a blank line  */

    DosClose(hp);

</PRE>

<P>
The client process checks the return value from<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>to verify that the pipe was actually opened. If the server process has
not yet created the pipe,<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>returns an error. When the client process finishes using the pipe, it
closes the pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> DosClose</A>.

<P>
When a named pipe is opened, its initial state is set by the system to block
read and write operations (blocking mode), and to read data as a byte stream
(byte-read mode). However, the client can change these modes by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC -->DosSetNPHState</A>. A call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>fails if all instances of the named pipe are already open.
<P>
The open also fails if the pipe has been closed by a client, but the server
has not called<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 5A --> DosDisConnectNPipe
</A>(to acknowledge the client's close), followed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 59 --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>(to prepare the pipe for the next client). In both of these situations,
ERROR_PIPE_BUSY is returned.
<P>
If all instances of a named pipe are busy, a client process can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0D C4 61 --> DosWaitNPipe
</A>to wait for an instance to become available before it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>again.
<P>
After a pipe instance has been opened by a client, that same instance cannot
be opened by another client at the same time.  However, the opening process
can duplicate the handle as many times as desired by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C3 FC --> DosDupHandle</A>.
This enables child processes to share access to a pipe instance with a parent
process.
<P>
The access-mode and sharing-mode fields that are specified for<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> DosOpen
</A>must be the same as those that were specified by the server<!-- entering slot 73 --> when
it created the pipe with<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>.
