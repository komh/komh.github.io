<H1>Terminating a Process</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
A process can end the execution of a descendant process by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 9A C3 FC --> DosKillProcess</A>.
This causes OS/2 to send a XCPT_SIGNAL_KILLPROC exception to the target
process. The child processes of the target process can also be ended.
<P>
The following code fragment ends the specified process and all child processes
belonging to that process:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    PID pidProcess;

    DosKillProcess(DKP_PROCESSTREE,
                   pidProcess);

</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the<I> pidProcess</I> parameter specifies which descendant
process to end. The process identifier is returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 4B --> DosExecPgm
</A>in the<I> codeTerminate</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C4 A2 --> RESULTCODES
</A>structure when you start the child process.
<P>
The parameter DKP_PROCESSTREE in the example indicates that the specified
process,<I> pidProcess</I>, and all of its descendant processes are to be
ended.
<P>
If you specify DKP_PROCESS in a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 9A C3 FC --> DosKillProcess</A>,
only the specified process is ended. Its child processes, if any, continue
to run.
<P>
The process to be ended must either be the current process, or it must have
been directly created by the current process with<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 4B --> DosExecPgm
</A>for asynchronous execution. That is, a process can end itself and its
descendants.
<P>
The process to be ended need not still be executing. If it has started its
own child processes, but has stopped executing, its children can still be
flagged for termination.
<P>
<B>Obtaining the Termination Status of a Child Process</B>
<BR>

<P>
OS/2 saves the termination status for a process if the process was started
by using the EXEC_ASYNCRESULT constant in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC --> DosExecPgm</A>.

<BR>
You can retrieve the termination status of the most recently ended process
by using the DCWW_NOWAIT constant with<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 4E --> DosWaitChild
</A>and setting the child process identification parameter to 0. The DCWW_NOWAIT
constant directs the function to return immediately, without waiting for
a process to end. Instead, the function retrieves the termination status
from the process that most recently ended. If you specify a child process
identification with DCWW_NOWAIT,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 4E --> DosWaitChild
</A>returns ERROR_CHILD_NOT_COMPLETE if the child process has not ended.
Once the specified process has ended,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 4E --> DosWaitChild
</A>returns its termination code.
<P>
The following code fragment starts a child session (the program SIMPLE.EXE),
and then retrieves the termination status from the process that most recently
ended.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS         /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    PSZ          pszArgs;
    PSZ          pszEnvs;
    RESULTCODES  rcReturnCodes;
    ULONG        ulPid;           /* Process ID (returned)             */
    ULONG        ulTarget;        /* Process ID of process to wait for */
    APIRET       ulrc;            /* Return code                       */

    strcpy(pszArgs,
           "-a2 -l");   /* Pass arguments "-a2" and "-l"                         */

    ulTarget = 0;       /* Process ID for the most recently ended process   */

    ulrc = DosExecPgm(szLoadError,            /* Object name buffer                */
                      sizeof(szLoadError),    /* Length of object name buffer      */
                      EXEC_ASYNCRESULT,       /* Asynchronous/Trace flags          */
                      pszArgs,                /* Argument string                   */
                      pszEnvs,                /* Environment string                */
                      &amp;rcReturnCodes,         /* Termination codes                 */
                      START_PROGRAM);         /* Program file name                 */

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosExecPgm error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

    ulrc = DosWaitChild(DCWA_PROCESS,         /* Execution options                 */
                        DCWW_NOWAIT,          /* Wait options                      */
                        &amp;rcReturnCodes,       /* Termination codes                 */
                        &amp;ulPid,               /* Process ID (returned)             */
                        ulTarget);            /* Process ID of process to wait for */

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosWaitChild error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }
