<H1>Closing a Mutex Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 168 -->
<P>
When a process no longer requires access to a mutex semaphore, it can close
the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
However, if a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore
is closed by OS/2.
<P>
The following code fragment closes a mutex semaphore. Assume that the handle
of the semaphore has been placed into<I> hmtx</I> already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HMTX    hmtx;    /* Mutex semaphore handle */
    APIRET  ulrc;    /* Return code            */

    ulrc = DosCloseMutexSem(hmtx);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosCloseMutexSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 3F --> DosCloseMutexSem</A> decrements
the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to 1 when the
semaphore is created and is incremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC --> DosOpenMutexSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted by OS/2.
<P>
The call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 3F --> DosCloseMutexSem</A> that
decrements the usage count to 0 and causes the semaphore to be deleted is
referred to as the<I> final close</I>. The final close will not succeed
if either of the following conditions exists:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The semaphore is owned by another thread in the same
process.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Another thread in the same process is still blocked
on a<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 42 --> DosRequestMutexSem</A> request
for the semaphore.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For both conditions, ERROR_SEM_BUSY is returned.
<P>
ERROR_SEM_BUSY is also returned if a thread tries to close a mutex semaphore
that it still owns. The thread must first relinquish ownership of the semaphore
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 FC --> DosReleaseMutexSem</A>.

<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 40 --> DosOpenMutexSem</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 3F --> DosCloseMutexSem
</A>can be nested, but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535.
If an attempt is made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.
