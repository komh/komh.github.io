<H1>Allocating Private Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 16 -->
<P>
An application can allocate regions of storage within the virtual address
space of the process. Such an allocated region is called a memory object.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 40 -->DosAllocMem</A> is used to allocate
a memory object. You specify a variable to receive the pointer that will
address the new object, the amount of memory needed, and the allocation
attributes and access protection attributes of the new memory object. When
choosing the size of the memory object to allocate, remember that the maximum
size of the memory object is defined when it is allocated, and memory objects
cannot be resized.
<P>
When applications call<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 FC --> DosAllocMem</A>,
the operating system reserves a range of private pages large enough to fulfill
the specified allocation request from the private virtual address space
of the subject process.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 40 -->DosAllocMem</A> will reserve this
linear space and return zero if the allocation was successful. If it was
unsuccessful,<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 40 --> DosAllocMem</A> will
return an error code. An application should always test the return value
before attempting to use the memory.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment requests an allocation of 512 bytes. Remember
that 4096 bytes will actually be allocated for this request:
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    PBYTE   pb;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosAllocMem((PVOID *) &amp;pb,
                       512,
                       fALLOC); /* pb receives the base address of the */
                                /* 4KB memory object                   */

    if (!ulrc) {           /* If the allocation was successful, ulrc == 0 */
        *pb = 3000;        /* Use the allocated memory                    */
    }

</PRE>

<P>
In this example,<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 40 --> DosAllocMem</A> returns
a 32-bit pointer to a 4096 byte committed memory object and allows the application
to write to and read from the memory. This pointer is valid only for the
4096 bytes allocated by the system. An attempt to use the pointer outside
the allocated memory will cause a protection violation.
