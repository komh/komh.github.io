<H1>Deleting a Semaphore from a Muxwait List</H1><!-- entering slot 178 -->
<P>
An application can delete semaphores from a muxwait semaphore by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> DosDeleteMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
Any thread in the process that created a muxwait semaphore can delete a
mutex or event semaphore from the muxwait list by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC --> DosDeleteMuxWaitSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also use this function, but they must first
gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
Semaphores can be deleted from the muxwait list even while threads are currently
waiting for the semaphore. If the deleted semaphore is the only one in the
muxwait list that has not yet been posted or released, then threads that
are waiting for the muxwait semaphore are unblocked. Also, if the deleted
semaphore happens to be the last one that a particular thread was waiting
for, that thread is unblocked. Also, if the deleted semaphore is the last
one in the muxwait list (that is, if the list is now empty), then all the
threads that are waiting for the muxwait semaphore are unblocked.
