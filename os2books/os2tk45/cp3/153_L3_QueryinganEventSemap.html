<H1>Querying an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 161 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 35 -->DosQueryEventSem</A> returns the current
post count of a semaphore. The post count is the number of times that the
semaphore has been posted (with<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 FC --> DosPostEventSem</A>)
since the last time the semaphore was reset. A count of 0 indicates that
the semaphore is in the reset state; therefore, OS/2 will block any threads
that call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 37 --> DosWaitEventSem</A> to wait
on the semaphore.
<P>
Any thread in the process that created an event semaphore can obtain the
post count for the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 FC --> DosQueryEventSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 FC --> DosQueryEventSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment retrieves the post count for an event semaphore.
Assume that the handle of the semaphore has been placed into<I><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 47 --> HEV
</A></I>already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HEV     hev;       /* Event semaphore handle                          */
    ULONG   ulPostCt;  /* Current post count for the semaphore (returned) */
    APIRET  ulrc;      /* Return code                                     */

    ulrc = DosQueryEventSem(hev,
                            &amp;ulPostCt);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosQueryEventSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>

<P>
If the specified event semaphore does not exist, ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is
returned.
