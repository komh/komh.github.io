<H1>Closing a Muxwait Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 174 -->
<P>
When a process no longer requires access to a muxwait semaphore, it closes
the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 FC --> DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A>.
However, if a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore
is closed by OS/2.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 21 --> DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A> decrements
the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to 1 when the
semaphore is created and is incremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted by OS/2.
<P>
The call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 21 --> DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A> that
decrements the usage count to 0 and causes the semaphore to be deleted is
referred to as the<I> final close</I>. If a thread attempts to perform the
final close for a semaphore while another thread in the same process is
still waiting for it, ERROR_SEM_BUSY is returned.
<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 22 --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 21 -->DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A> can be nested,
but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535. If an attempt is
made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.
