<H1>Adding a Semaphore to a Muxwait List</H1><!-- entering slot 177 -->
<P>
An application uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C3 35 --> DosAddMuxWaitSem
</A>to add semaphores to a muxwait semaphore that has already been created,
even while threads are waiting on the muxwait semaphore.
<P>
Any thread in the process that created a muxwait semaphore can add a mutex
semaphore or an event semaphore to the muxwait list by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C3 FC --> DosAddMuxWaitSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also use this function, but they must first
gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 FC --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
A maximum of 64 semaphores can be included in a muxwait-semaphore list.
If an attempt is made to exceed this maximum, ERROR_TOO_MANY_SEMAPHORES
is returned.
<P>
All of the semaphores in a muxwait-semaphore list must be of the same type.
That is, if a mutex semaphore is being added, then the other semaphores
in the list must be mutex semaphores. If an event semaphore is being added,
then the other semaphores in the list must be event semaphores. A shared
muxwait semaphore can contain only shared semaphores in its list. A private
muxwait semaphore can contain both private and shared semaphores. If any
of these conditions is violated, ERROR_WRONG_TYPE is returned.
<P>
If the semaphore is successfully added to the muxwait list,<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C3 35 --> DosAddMuxWaitSem
</A>checks to see whether each thread that is waiting for the muxwait semaphore
has the newly added semaphore open in its process. The muxwait semaphore
is invalid for any waiting threads that do not have the newly added semaphore
open in their process; these threads are unblocked with a return code of
ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE. Any processes that opened the muxwait semaphore before
the add operation and that do not have the new semaphore open, will have
to open the new semaphore before making any further use of the muxwait semaphore.
Any future calls concerning the muxwait semaphore by processes that do not
have the new semaphore open will have ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE returned until
the new semaphore is opened.
<P>
A thread that receives a return code of ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE can take the
following corrective action:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the thread can obtain the records of all
the semaphores in the muxwait list by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 FC --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Next, it can query each semaphore in the muxwait
list, using<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 3A --> DosQueryMutexSem</A> or
<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 FC -->DosQueryEventSem</A>, to find out
which semaphore is not open to its process.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finally, it can open the semaphores that are
not open by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 37 --> DosOpenMutexSem
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
As soon as this semaphore is opened, the muxwait semaphore becomes valid
again for the process, as long as no other changes have been made to the
muxwait list to make it invalid. However, in order to successfully wait
for the muxwait semaphore, the process must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 3C --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>again.
<P>
A semaphore must be open for a process before the process can add that semaphore
to a muxwait semaphore. If it is not open and a thread is waiting on the
muxwait semaphore,<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C3 35 --> DosAddMuxWaitSem
</A>returns ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE to the process adding the new semaphore,
and the waiting thread continues waiting.
