<H1>Waiting for an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 160 -->
<P>
Any thread in the process that created an event semaphore can wait for the
semaphore to be posted by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>.
Threads in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.

<P>
If the semaphore is already posted when<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>is called, the function returns immediately, and the thread continues
to run. Otherwise, the thread is blocked until the semaphore is posted.

<P>
The following code fragment causes the calling thread to wait until the
specified event semaphore is posted. Assume that the handle of the semaphore
has been placed into<I><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 52 --> HEV</A></I> already.
<I>ulTimeout</I> is the number of milliseconds that the calling thread will
wait for the event semaphore to be posted. If the specified event semaphore
is not posted during this time interval, the request times out.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #define INCL_DOSERRORS       /* error codes      */

    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HEV     hev;        /* Event semaphore handle         */
    ULONG   ulTimeout;  /* Number of milliseconds to wait */
    APIRET  ulrc;       /* Return code                    */

    ulTimeout = 60000;  /* Wait for a maximum of 1 minute */

    ulrc = DosWaitEventSem(hev,
                           ulTimeout);

    if (ulrc == ERROR_TIMEOUT) {
        printf("DosWaitEventSem call timed out");
        return;
    }

    if (ulrc == ERROR_INTERRUPT) {
        printf("DosWaitEventSem call was interrupted");
        return;
    }

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosWaitEventSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
If the time limit specified in<I> ulTimeout</I> is reached before the semaphore
is posted, ERROR_TIMEOUT is returned. If the waiting period is interrupted
for some reason before the semaphore is posted, ERROR_INTERRUPT is returned.
If SEM_IMMEDIATE_RETURN is specified for the time limit,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>returns to the calling thread immediately. If SEM_INDEFINITE_WAIT is
specified for the time limit, the thread waits indefinitely.
<P>
Unlike multiple event semaphores in a muxwait list, which are level-triggered,
single event semaphores are<I> edge-triggered</I>. This means that if an
event semaphore is posted and then reset before a waiting thread gets a
chance to run, the semaphore is considered to be posted for the rest of
that thread's waiting period; the thread does not have to wait for the semaphore
to be posted again.
