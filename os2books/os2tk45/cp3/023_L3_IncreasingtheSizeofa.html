<H1>Increasing the Size of a Heap</H1><!-- entering slot 23 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 3D -->DosSubSetMem</A> can also be used
to increase the size of a previously initialized heap. The heap size can
be increased up to the size of the memory object that contains it.
<P>
The size of the heap is rounded up to the next higher multiple of 8 bytes.

<P>
The following code fragment increases the size of a heap. Assume that the
<I>Offset</I> variable was previously loaded with the virtual address of
the memory object.
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    PVOID   pOffset;    /* Address of the heap to be used for suballocation */
    ULONG   ulFlags;    /* Flags describing the memory object being resized */
    ULONG   ulSize;     /* Size in bytes to increase the size of the heap   */
    APIRET  ulrc;       /* Return code                                      */

    ulSize = 20000;     /* Indicate a heap size increase of 20000 bytes     */

    /* DOSSUB_INIT set to initialize memory for suballocation */
    ulFlags = DOSSUB_INIT |
              DOSSUB_SPARSE_OBJ;

    ulrc = DosSubSetMem(pOffset,
                        ulFlags,
                        ulSize);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosSubSetMem error: return code = %ld", ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the heap is incremented, and that memory commitment is
managed internally within subsequent<A><!-- external link: 1D FF C3 3C --> DosSubAllocMem
</A>calls.
<P>
When using<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 3D --> DosSubSetMem</A> to increase
the size of the heap, the<I> Flags</I> parameter must have the same setting
as when the heap was initialized.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Do not call<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 3A --> DosSetMem
</A>to change the allocation attribute or access protection attributes of
any pages spanned by a memory object that the suballocation functions are
managing. Otherwise, unpredictable results could occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
Call<A><!-- external link: 1D 02 C4 3E --> DosSubUnsetMem</A> when finished
with the heap that was set up with<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 FC --> DosSubSetMem</A>.
This enables the suballocation function to free the resources that it uses
to manage the heap. When you are through with the memory object that the
heap was part of, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 38 --> DosFreeMem</A> to
free the memory object.
