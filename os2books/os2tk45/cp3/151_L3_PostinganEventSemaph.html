<H1>Posting an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 159 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 3B -->DosPostEventSem</A> posts the semaphore,
if it is not already posted, and increments the post count. All threads
that have called<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem</A> for
this semaphore are unblocked and resume execution. Threads that call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>after the event semaphore has been posted and before the next time it
is reset, will return immediately from a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>and continue execution. If the semaphore is subsequently reset, threads
that call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 3F --> DosWaitEventSem</A> will
again be blocked.
<P>
Any thread in the process that created an event semaphore can post the semaphore
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 FC --> DosPostEventSem</A>. Threads
in other processes can also call<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 FC --> DosPostEventSem</A>,
but they must first gain access to the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment posts a system event semaphore. Assume that
the handle of the semaphore has been placed into<I><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 52 --> HEV
</A></I>already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HEV     hev;     /* Event semaphore handle */
    APIRET  ulrc;    /* Return code            */

    ulrc = DosPostEventSem(hev);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosPostEventSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
OS/2 maintains a post count for each event semaphore. The post count is
the number of times the semaphore has been posted (with<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 FC --> DosPostEventSem</A>)
since the last time the semaphore was in the reset state.
<P>
If the event semaphore is reset when<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 3B --> DosPostEventSem
</A>is called, the semaphore is posted and the post count is set to 1. If
the event semaphore is already posted when<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 3B --> DosPostEventSem
</A>is called, the post count is incremented, and ERROR_ALREADY_POSTED is
returned to the calling thread.
<P>
The post count is returned as output by<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>;
it can also be obtained by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 FC --> DosQueryEventSem</A>.

<P>
The maximum number of times an event semaphore can be posted is 65535. The
value of the post count cannot exceed 65535. If an attempt is made to exceed
this number,<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 3B --> DosPostEventSem</A> returns
ERROR_TOO_MANY_POSTS.
