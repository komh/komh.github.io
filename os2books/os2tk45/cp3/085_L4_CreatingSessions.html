<H1>Creating Sessions</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->
<P>
A process creates a new session by using<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 -->DosStartSession</A> enables an application
to start another session and to specify the name of the application to be
started in that session.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 -->DosStartSession</A> also specifies
which of the five session types is to be started:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Full screen, protect mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Text windowed, protect mode<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Presentation Manager (PM)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Full screen DOS Session<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Windowed DOS Session<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Protect mode applications run in full screen and text windowed sessions,
PM and AVIO applications run in PM windows, and DOS applications run in
full screen DOS Sessions and windowed DOS Sessions.
<P>
OS/2 applications running in any of the OS/2 session types-full screen,
text windowed, and PM-can start sessions of any other type, including DOS
Sessions. DOS Session applications cannot start other sessions.
<P>
An application can start another process in a separate session when the
application will not manage any I/O done by the process. For example, an
application that starts an unrelated application could start it in a separate
session.
<P>
A session can be started as a related or an unrelated session. A related
session is called a<I> child session</I>, and the session starting the child
session is called the<I> parent session</I>. An application can control
its child sessions by using the session identifier returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 --> DosStartSession
</A>with the<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 FC --> DosSetSession</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 FC --> DosSelectSession</A>,
and<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 FC --> DosStopSession</A>. If an application
starts an<I> unrelated session</I>, the new session cannot be controlled
by the application. The Related field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C4 BB --> STARTDATA
</A>structure specifies whether the new session is related to the session
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>.
<P>
After a process has started a child session, no other process in its session
can start a child session until all dependent sessions started by this process
have ended.
<P>
When a session is created, the title specified in the function call (or
the application name if no title is specified) is added to the Window List.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 -->DosStartSession</A> can be used to
start either a foreground or a background session, but a new session can
be started in the foreground only when the caller's session, or one of the
caller's descendant sessions, is currently executing in the foreground.
The foreground session for windowed applications is the session of the application
that owns the window focus.
<P>
<B>Termination Queues</B> The parent session must create a<I> termination
queue</I> prior to specifying the queue name in a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> DosStartSession</A>.
OS/2 will continue to notify the parent session through the specified queue
as long as the session calling<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 --> DosStartSession
</A>remains a parent session. In other words, when all the child sessions
for a particular parent session end, the termination queue is closed by
OS/2. An existing queue name must be specified on the next<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 --> DosStartSession
</A>call if the caller wants to continue receiving termination notification
messages.
<P>
OS/2 writes a data element to the specified queue when any child session
ends. The queue is posted regardless or who ends the child session (the
child, the parent, or the user) and whether the termination is normal or
abnormal.
<P>
A parent session calls<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 46 --> DosReadQueue
</A>to receive notification when a child session has ended. The word that
contains the request parameter, returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>,
will be 0. The data element has the following format:
<P>
<B>Termination Queue Element Format</B>
<PRE>┌──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│Size      │Description                                       │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│WORD      │Session ID of the child session that ended        │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│WORD      │Result code                                       │
└──────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
The process that originally called the<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 --> DosStartSession
</A>request should call<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>,
with the NOWAIT parameter set to 0. This is the only process that has addressability
to the notification data element. After reading and processing the data
element, the caller must free the segment containing the data element by
calling DosFreeMem.
<P>
When a child session ends, the result code returned in the termination queue's
data element is the result code of the program specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 49 --> DosStartSession
</A>call, providing either one of the following is true:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The program was run directly, with no intermediate
secondary command processor<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The program is run indirectly through a secondary
command processor, and the /C parameter is specified<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When a child session is running in the foreground at the time it ends, the
parent session becomes the new foreground session. When a parent session
ends, any child sessions are ended. When an unrelated session ends in the
foreground, OS/2 selects the next foreground session.
