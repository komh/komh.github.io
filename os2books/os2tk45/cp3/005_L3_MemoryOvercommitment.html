<H1>Memory Overcommitment and Swapping</H1><!-- entering slot 5 -->
<P>
Memory overcommitment occurs when applications allocate and commit more
memory than is actually available in the computer. OS/2 handles memory overcommitment
by copying memory to the system swap file, SWAPPER.DAT, on the hard disk
then reusing the memory for another allocation. OS/2 copies as many pages
of memory as are necessary to make room for the new allocation. The swapped
memory can be retrieved the next time it is accessed; at that time, some
other memory might be written to the swap file.
<P>
OS/2 selects the memory to swap based on when it was last used. The page
that is least-recently-used, that is, the page that has gone the longest
since its last access, is the page chosen to swap to disk.
<P>
Swapping is transparent to an application, although excessive swapping can
cause an application to run slowly.
<P>
Through swapping, OS/2 enables applications to allocate more memory than
actually exists in the computer, bounded only by the amount of free space
on the hard disk that contains the swap file.
