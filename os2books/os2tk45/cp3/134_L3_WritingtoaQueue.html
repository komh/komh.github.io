<H1>Writing to a Queue</H1><!-- entering slot 140 -->
<P>
The server process and any of its threads can add an element to a queue
simply by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 FC --> DosWriteQueue</A>.
A client process, however, must first request access to the queue by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 FC -->DosOpenQueue</A>.
<P>
Processes that communicate by passing the addresses of shared memory objects
through the queue must have a shared memory object that they each have access
to. Once a process opens the queue, it can allocate shared memory by using
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 42 -->DosAllocMem</A> with the OBJ_GIVEABLE
attribute and then give the shared memory to the queue owner with<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C3 FC --> DosGiveSharedMem</A>.

<P>
A process that has opened a queue can write to the queue by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 FC --> DosWriteQueue</A>.
The writing process must create elements in a form that the queue owner
can read.
<P>
The following code fragment adds an element to a queue. Assume that the
caller has placed the handle of the queue into<I> QueueHandle</I> already.
Assume also that<I> DataBuffer</I> has been set to point to a data element
in shared memory, and that<I> DataLength</I> has been set to contain the
length of the data element in shared memory.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSQUEUES   /* Queue values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HQUEUE   hqQueueHandle;   /* Queue handle                         */
    ULONG    ulRequest;       /* Request-identification data          */
    ULONG    ulDataLength;    /* Length of element being added        */
    PVOID    pDataBuffer;     /* Element being added                  */
    ULONG    ulElemPriority;  /* Priority of element being added      */
    APIRET   ulrc;            /* Return code                          */

    ulRequest = 0;            /* Assume that no special data is being */
                              /* sent along with this write request   */

    ulElemPriority = 0;       /* For priority-based queues: add the   */
                              /* new queue element at the logical end */
                              /* of the queue                         */

    ulrc = DosWriteQueue(hqQueueHandle,
                         ulRequest,
                         ulDataLength,
                         pDataBuffer,
                         ulElemPriority);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosWriteQueue error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Once the process has written to the queue, it frees the shared memory. However,
the memory will not be freed until the queue owner also frees it.
<P>
If the queue was created as a priority-based queue (as specified in the
<I>QueueFlags</I> parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> DosCreateQueue</A>),
then the priority of the element that is being added must be specified.

<P>
If the server process has ended, or if it has closed the queue before<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 47 --> DosWriteQueue
</A>is called, then ERROR_QUE_INVALID_HANDLE is returned.
