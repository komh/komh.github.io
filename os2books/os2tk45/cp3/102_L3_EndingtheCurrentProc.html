<H1>Ending the Current Process</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
You end the current process by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 FC --> DosExit</A>.
When you exit, the system stops the process and frees any existing resources
the process owns.
<P>

<P>
In the following code fragment,<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 39 --> DosExit
</A>is used to end the process if the given file does not exist:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS     /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define HF_STDERR 2         /* Standard error handle     */

    HFILE   hf;
    ULONG   ulAction, ulWritten;
    APIRET  rc;

    rc = DosOpen("SAMPLE.TXT",
                 &amp;hf,
                 &amp;ulAction,
                 0,
                 FILE_NORMAL,
                 FILE_OPEN,
                 OPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY |
                 OPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE,
                 (PEAOP2) NULL);

    if (rc) {
        DosWrite(HF_STDERR,
                 "Cannot open file\r\n",
                 18,
                 &amp;ulWritten);

        DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS,
                rc);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
EXIT_PROCESS directs<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 39 --> DosExit</A> to
end all the threads in a process including the calling thread, thus ending
the process.<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 39 --> DosExit</A> includes
an error value that is returned to the parent process through the<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C4 75 --> RESULTCODES
</A>structure specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 38 --> DosExecPgm
</A>call that started the process. If you started the application from the
command line, the command processor, CMD.EXE, makes this value available
through the ERRORLEVEL variable. If another process started the application,
that process can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 3C --> DosWaitChild
</A>to determine the error value.
<P>
If you want to exit only from a given thread, you can call<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 39 --> DosExit
</A>with the EXIT_THREAD constant. This will end only the calling thread;
 other threads in the process are not affected. If the thread you end is
the last thread in the process, the process also ends. If the thread consists
of a function, the thread ends when the function returns.
