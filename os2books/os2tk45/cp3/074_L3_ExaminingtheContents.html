<H1>Examining the Contents of Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 78 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A -->DosPeekNPipe</A> examines the current
contents of a named pipe.
<P>
Named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_INBOUND access mode cannot use the
<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A -->DosPeekNPipe</A> function. If the
named pipe's client uses the<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A --> DosPeekNPipe
</A>function, the function returns error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).
<P>
It is similar to<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 FC --> DosRead</A>, except
that<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A --> DosPeekNPipe</A> does not remove
data from the pipe. In addition,<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A --> DosPeekNPipe
</A>never blocks, even if the pipe is in blocking mode; if the pipe cannot
be accessed immediately, ERROR_PIPE_BUSY is returned.
<P>
Because<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A --> DosPeekNPipe</A> does not
block, it returns only what is currently in the pipe. Thus, if a message
pipe is being examined, only a portion of a message might be returned, even
though the specified buffer length could accommodate the entire message.

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 4A -->DosPeekNPipe</A> also returns the
state of the pipe. A named pipe can be in any of the following states: Connected,
Disconnected, Listening, Closing.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to use<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C3 FC --> DosPeekNPipe</A>:

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSNMPIPES   /* Named-pipe values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HPIPE              hpHandle;      /* Pipe handle                */
    UCHAR              ucBuffer[200]; /* Address of user buffer     */
    ULONG              ulBufferLen;   /* Buffer length              */
    ULONG              ulBytesRead;   /* Bytes read (returned)      */
    struct _AVAILDATA  BytesAvail;    /* Bytes available (returned) */
    ULONG              ulPipeState;   /* Pipe state (returned)      */
    APIRET             ulrc;          /* Return code                */

    ulBufferLen = 200;  /* Length of the read buffer */

    ulrc = DosPeekNPipe(hpHandle,
                        ucBuffer,
                        ulBufferLen,
                        &amp;ulBytesRead,
                        &amp;BytesAvail,
                        &amp;ulPipeState);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosPeekNPipe error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return, the input buffer<I> Buffer</I> will contain up to
the first 200 bytes from the named pipe,<I> BytesRead</I> will contain the
number of bytes read into<I> Buffer</I>,<I> BytesAvail</I> will contain
the total number of bytes that were available in the pipe, and<I> PipeState
</I>will contain a value indicating the state of the named pipe.
