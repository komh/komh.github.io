<H1>Unnamed Shared Memory Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 138 -->
<P>
Unrelated processes generally use unnamed shared memory objects for storing
queue data. This makes it possible for a client process to store data in
a shared memory object without knowing its name. To use unnamed shared memory
objects for storing queue data, the server process must take the following
steps whenever it is called by a client:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Save the process identification (PID) of the
client process.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allocate an unnamed shared memory object for
the data of the client process by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> DosAllocSharedMem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Give the client process the capability of accessing
the memory object by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C3 1A --> DosGiveSharedMem
</A>with the client's PID.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The client process must then call<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 1B --> DosOpenQueue
</A>to gain access to the server's queue.
<P>
After each client completes its queue requests or ends, the server calls
<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 19 -->DosFreeMem</A> to release the client's
memory object.
