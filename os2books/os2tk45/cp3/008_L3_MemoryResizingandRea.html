<H1>Memory Resizing and Reallocation</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
In earlier versions of OS/2, an application could increase or decrease the
size of an allocated memory segment by reallocating the segment.
<P>
Memory objects cannot be resized. Instead, an application should allocate
a sparse memory object of whatever size might be necessary, then commit
or decommit portions of the object.
<P>
If the amount of memory required cannot be determined at the time the memory
is allocated, the application should allocate a sparse memory object large
enough to meet the largest memory requirement. The application can then
change the amount of committed memory as necessary.
<P>
For example, if you anticipate your application will use around 512KB of
memory for most purposes, but might use 5MB under certain circumstances,
you might take the following steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->During program initialization, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 29 --> DosAllocMem
</A>to allocate 5MB.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Commit the first 512KB (or some part of it) using
<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC -->DosSetMem</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Proceed with normal processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If extra memory is required occasionally, commit it
and decommit it using<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC --> DosSetMem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the situation arises that the application requires
the full 5MB, commit it at that time, using<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC --> DosSetMem</A>,
then decommit it after you are finished with it, also using<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC --> DosSetMem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the application is finished with the memory,
use<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 2A --> DosFreeMem</A> to release the
memory back to the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
