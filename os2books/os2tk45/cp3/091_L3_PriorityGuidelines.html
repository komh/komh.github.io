<P>
Within the two most common priority classes-time-critical and regular-there
are certain broad guidelines recommended for choosing the priority level
for a program.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->TIME-CRITICAL CLASS
<P>
The guidelines for level within the time critical class are set to maximize
the number of different applications that can successfully multitask in
an OS/2 system. The guidelines are described in the following table.

                                        쿟herefore the highest priority levels should be reserved for
                                        퀃hese applications.

<P>
In general, application performance is not a good reason to make a thread
time critical.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->REGULAR CLASS

In cases where explicit priority levels are set, they should follow the
guidelines listed below.
