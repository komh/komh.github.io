<H1>Asynchronous Timers</H1><!-- entering slot 183 --><A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 1C -->DosSleep
</A>is useful for temporarily suspending a thread but is much less useful
for timing. Typically, an application carries out part of its task and then
waits an interval. If the execution time varies (as it will if the application
runs on different hardware), the overall interval varies. In these situations,
asynchronous timers provide greater precision than<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 FC --> DosSleep</A>.

<P>
OS/2 supports two types of asynchronous timers, single-interval (one-shot)
and repeated.<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 1A --> DosAsyncTimer</A> starts
a single-interval timer. During the timing interval, the application can
carry out other tasks. The system posts an event semaphore when the timing
interval elapses. The application can reset the semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 1B --> DosResetEventSem
</A>before starting the timer.<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 1A --> DosAsyncTimer
</A>yields a more accurate timing interval than<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 1C --> DosSleep
</A>because the interval is independent of the execution time.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 1D -->DosStartTimer</A> starts a repeated
timer. The system posts an event semaphore each time the interval expires.
The application can reset the semaphore before starting the timer and after
each posting. When the application resets the semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>,
it can check the<I> cPosts</I> value to determine how many times the semaphore
has been posted. If the semaphore has been posted more than once, the application
has missed a timer interval.
