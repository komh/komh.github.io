<P>
Multitasking is the ability of OS/2 to manage the execution of more than
one application at a time. A multitasking operating system, such as OS/2
enables users to run many applications simultaneously.
<P>
For the programmer, OS/2 supports two types of multitasking. An application
can start other programs, in separate processes, that will execute concurrently
with the application. These programs can be a new copy of the application,
a related program that is designed to work with the application, or an unrelated
program. Running multiple processes is the first type of multitasking provided
for programmers.
<P>
Running multiple threads is the second type of multitasking supported by
OS/2. OS/2 enables applications to run multiple threads of execution within
the same process; separate activities can be multitasked within the application.
An example of multiple-thread multitasking would be for the application
to dispatch a separate subroutine to load a file from the disk, and have
the subroutine execute at the same time the main program continues to monitor
and respond to user input.
<P>
This chapter describes processes, threads, and sessions, and the OS/2 functions
used to create and manage them. Additionally, there is a section describing
CPU scheduling.
