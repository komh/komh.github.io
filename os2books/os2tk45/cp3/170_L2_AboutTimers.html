<H1>About Timers</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->Because OS/2 is a multitasking system, an application
cannot predict when it will lose execution control or how much time will
elapse before control returns. A<I> timer</I> enables an application to
suspend operation for a specific length of time, to block a thread until
an interval has elapsed, or to post an event semaphore at repeated intervals.

<P>
Timers are managed by OS/2. When an application requests a timer, the system
monitors the system clock and notifies the application when the interval
has elapsed.
<P>
The system clock counts the number of system-clock interrupts (clock ticks)
that have occurred since the system was started. On most hardware, clock
ticks occur approximately 32 times a second, so the length of a tick is
approximately 31.25 milliseconds.
<P>
When an application specifies a timer interval, the system rounds up the
interval to the next clock tick. For example, if an application requests
a 10 millisecond interval, it will sleep for at least 31.25 milliseconds.
If an application requests a 100 millisecond interval, the actual interval
will be at least 125 milliseconds (4 ticks).
<P>
Because OS/2 is a preemptive operating system, there is no guarantee that
a thread will resume immediately after the timer interval. If a higher priority
process or thread is executing, the timed thread must wait.
<P>
Although timers are not absolutely accurate, they can be used where the
inaccuracy can be ignored. In a real-time control application, for example,
an event can be timed in seconds or minutes, so an error of a few milliseconds
is unimportant. If an application requires as much accuracy as the system
can provide, it can dedicate a thread to managing timer intervals and then
elevate the priority of that thread.
