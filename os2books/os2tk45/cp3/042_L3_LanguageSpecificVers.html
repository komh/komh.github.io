<H1>Language-Specific Versions of NLS-Enabled Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 42 -->
<P>
There are two methods of creating a specific national language version of
a program designed to handle more than one national language. The choice
of the method depends on the amount of available disk space and whether
the user wants to change between different languages once the program is
installed. The two methods are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Statically link the resources to the application's
.EXE files. The executable files are then language-specific and cannot be
changed to another national language. The specific .EXE files are then sent
to the user.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Place the resources into a language-specific, dynamic
link library. Designate one library file for each national language. Selecting
a particular library file for use with the application gives the desired
version of the program. Using this method, all national languages can be
shipped with the product; selection of the national language occurs during
installation (for example, by naming a specific .DLL file). It is possible
to change the national language setting while the program is operating.
