<H1>Writing to Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 75 -->
<P>
Both the server and the client processes write to a pipe by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.
The server writes to the handle that was returned to it by<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC --> DosCreateNPipe</A>,
and the client writes to the handle that was returned to it by<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.

<P>
Either bytes or messages can be written, depending on whether the pipe was
created as a byte pipe or as a message pipe.
<P>
Named pipes created with the NP_ACCESS_OUTBOUND access mode cannot use the
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A -->DosWrite</A> function. If the named
pipe's client uses the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite</A> function,
the function returns error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).
<P>
An attempt to write to a pipe whose other end has been closed returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE
or, if the other end was closed without without reading all pending data,
ERROR_DISCARDED.
<P>
When a process writes to a message pipe, the buffer-length parameter for
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A -->DosWrite</A> holds the size of the
message that the process is writing. Because<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite
</A>automatically encodes message lengths in the pipe, applications do not
have to encode this information in the data buffers.
<P>
The action taken by<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite</A> depends
on the blocking mode of the pipe, which is not necessarily the same for
the server and client ends of the pipe. For the server process, the blocking
mode of the pipe is specified when the pipe is created. For a client process,
the blocking mode is automatically set to blocking when the pipe is opened.
The blocking mode can also be reset by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 C3 FC --> DosSetNPHState</A>.

<P>
If the end of the message pipe that is being written to is in blocking mode,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A -->DosWrite</A> does not return until
all of the requested bytes have been written. (It might have to wait for
the first part of the message to be read before it can write the rest of
the message.)
<P>
If the message pipe is in nonblocking mode,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite
</A>takes the following action:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the message is larger than the pipe buffer,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite
</A>blocks until the entire message has been written. (Again, it might have
to wait for the first part of the message to be read before it can write
the rest of the message.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the message is smaller than the pipe buffer, but
there is currently not enough room in the buffer,<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite
</A>returns with a value of 0 in the Bytes-Written parameter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If a byte pipe is in nonblocking mode, and if there is more data to be written
than will fit in the pipe buffer, then<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 3A --> DosWrite
</A>writes as many bytes as will fit in the buffer and returns the number
of bytes that were actually written.
<P>
If a process tries to write to a pipe whose other end is closed, ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE
is returned.
