<H1>Preparing a Named Pipe for a Client</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
A server process uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 1C --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>to put a newly created named pipe into the listening state. The pipe
must be in the listening state in order for a client process to gain access
to the pipe by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> DosOpen</A>.

<P>
After successfully opening the pipe and finishing its transactions, the
client process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 1B --> DosClose</A> to
end its access to the pipe. The server process must acknowledge the close
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 FC --> DosDisConnectNPipe</A>.
It can then call<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 1C --> DosConnectNPipe</A> again
to put the pipe into the listening state for the next client.
<P>
Together,<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 1C --> DosConnectNPipe</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 1D -->DosDisConnectNPipe</A> enable a server
to create a named pipe and to reuse it for communication with different
clients. Without these functions, the server would have to delete and re-create
the pipe for each client.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If multiple instances of a named pipe have been created, then
each instance of the pipe must be put into the listening state before it
can be opened by a client.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
