<H1>Event Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 149 -->
<P>
An event semaphore provides a signaling mechanism among threads or processes,
ensuring that events occur in the desired sequence. Event semaphores are
used by one thread to signal other threads that an event has occurred. An
application can use this type of semaphore to block a thread or process
until the event has occurred.
<P>
An event semaphore has two states, reset and posted. When an event semaphore
is in the reset state, OS/2 blocks any thread or process that is waiting
on the semaphore. When an event semaphore is in the posted state, all threads
or processes waiting on the semaphore resume execution.
<P>
For example, assume thread 1 is allocating a shared memory object and threads
2 and 3 must wait for the memory to be allocated before they attempt to
examine its contents. Before thread 1 allocates the memory, it creates an
event semaphore, specifying the initial state of the semaphore as reset.
(If the event semaphore has already been created, thread 1 simply resets
the semaphore.) Threads 2 and 3 use<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 34 --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>to wait for the semaphore to signal that the event, in this case the
allocation and preparation of the shared memory object, has been completed.
Because the semaphore was reset by thread 1, threads 2 and 3 are blocked
when they call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>.
After thread 1 has finished allocating and placing data in the shared memory
object, it signals the completion of its task by posting the event semaphore.
The posting of the event semaphore unblocks threads 2 and 3, enabling them
to resume execution. They can then proceed to examine the contents of the
allocated memory.
<P>
In the example above, one thread controls the resetting and posting of the
event semaphore, while other threads merely wait on the semaphore. Another
approach could be for an application or thread to reset an event semaphore,
then block itself on that semaphore. At a later time, another application
or thread would post the event semaphore, unblocking the first thread.
