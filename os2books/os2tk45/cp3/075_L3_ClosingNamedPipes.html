<H1>Closing Named Pipes</H1><!-- entering slot 79 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 35 -->DosClose</A> closes the specified
pipe handle. When all of the handles that access one end of a pipe have
been closed, the pipe is referred to as a<I> broken pipe</I>.
<P>
If the client end of the pipe closes, no other process can reopen the pipe
until the server calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 37 --> DosDisConnectNPipe
</A>(to acknowledge the client's close) followed by<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 36 --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>(to prepare the pipe for a new client). Until it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 FC --> DosDisConnectNPipe</A>,
the server will receive ERROR_EOF if it tries to read from the pipe, and
ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE if it tries to write to it. Clients that attempt to open
the pipe receive ERROR_PIPE_BUSY.
<P>
If the server end closes when the client end is already closed, the pipe
is deallocated immediately; otherwise, the pipe is not deallocated until
the last client handle is closed.
<P>
The following code fragment shows how to close a named pipe.  Assume that
a previous call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 39 --> DosOpen</A> provided
the named pipe handle that is contained in<I> Handle</I>.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSNMPIPES   /* Named-pipe values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HPIPE   hpHandle;      /* Pipe handle */
    APIRET  ulrc;          /* Return code */

    ulrc = DosDisConnectNPipe(hpHandle);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosDisConnectNPipe error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }
