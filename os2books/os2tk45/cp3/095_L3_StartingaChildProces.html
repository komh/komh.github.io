<H1>Starting a Child Process</H1><!-- entering slot 99 -->
<P>
You start a process by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC --> DosExecPgm</A>.
The process you start is a child of the calling, or parent, process and
inherits many of the resources owned by the parent process, such as file
handles.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 2A -->DosExecPgm</A> creates a process environment
from an executable file. The target program is loaded into storage, and
it begins execution.
<P>
The following code fragment starts an application named ABC:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    CHAR szFailName[CCHMAXPATH];
    RESULTCODES resc;

    DosExecPgm(szFailName,           /* Object-name buffer  */
               sizeof(szFailName),   /* Length of buffer    */
               EXEC_SYNC,            /* Sync flag           */
               (PSZ) NULL,           /* Argument string     */
               (PSZ) NULL,           /* Environment string  */
               &amp;resc,                /* Address for result  */
               "ABC.EXE");           /* Name of application */

</PRE>

<P>
In this example, ABC runs synchronously (as specified by EXEC_SYNC). This
means the parent process temporarily stops while the child process runs.
The parent process does not continue until the child process ends.
