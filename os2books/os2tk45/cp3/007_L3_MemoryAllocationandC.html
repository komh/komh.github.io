<H1>Memory Allocation and Commitment</H1><!-- entering slot 7 -->
<P>
When an application asks OS/2 to allocate memory, a linear address range
is reserved. The range is not backed by physical memory until the memory
is<I> committed</I>. Commitment assigns physical memory to the linear address
range.
<P>
A memory object that is allocated, but not committed is called a<I> sparse
memory object</I>. A sparse memory object must be committed before it can
be used. An attempt to read from or write to uncommitted memory will cause
an access violation.
<P>
An application can ask OS/2 to commit the memory at the same time it is
allocated, thus making it immediately usable, or the memory can be committed
at a later time. If the application commits the memory at the same time
the memory is allocated, the entire memory object is committed. If the application
commits the memory at a later time, it can commit the entire sparse memory
object or only commit a portion of it.
<P>
When multiple pages are committed at the same time (a page range), the pages
will have sequential linear addresses.
<P>
<B>Managing Memory Allocation and Commitment</B>
<BR>
The recommended way to manage memory is to make a large memory allocation
early in program execution, then to commit or suballocate memory as the
need occurs.
<P>
The initial allocation should be for as much space as you expect to use
during program execution. Allocation without commitment does not actually
use any physical memory, so there is no waste involved in allocating several
megabytes.
<P>
After the memory object is allocated, the application uses one of two ways
to manage the memory object:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Commit and decommit the memory as it is required<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set up the memory object as a heap and suballocate
memory from the heap.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Committing and decommitting memory gives the application more control over
the process, but the application will have to keep track of which pages
are committed and which pages are not. When suballocating memory from a
heap, the application can have OS/2 track commitment and decommitment of
physical memory pages, so the application does not have to. If you want
<A><!-- external link: 1D FF C3 3D -->DosSubAllocMem</A> to manage the commitment
of the pages spanned by the heap, all of the pages spanned by the memory
object must be uncommitted initially.
<P>
Remember, no matter how much memory is originally allocated, the amount
that an application will ultimately be able to commit and use is limited
by the amount of physical memory and free disk space available on the machine.

<P>
Applications are not limited to a single large allocation of memory-other
memory allocations can be made as necessary during execution-but large allocations
and small commitments or suballocations are the most efficient way to manage
memory.
