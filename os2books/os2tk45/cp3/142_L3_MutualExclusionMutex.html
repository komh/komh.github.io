<H1>Mutual Exclusion (Mutex) Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 150 -->
<P>
A mutual exclusion (mutex) semaphore protects resources (such as files,
data in memory, and peripheral devices) from simultaneous access by several
processes. Mutex semaphores enable threads to serialize their access to
resources. It does so by preventing the processes from concurrently executing
the sections of code through which access is made. These sections of code
are called critical sections. For example, a mutex semaphore could be used
to prevent two or more threads from simultaneously writing to the same file
on a disk.
<P>
Before a thread can execute a mutex-protected critical section, it must
request and receive ownership of the mutex semaphore. Only the thread that
has gained ownership of the mutex semaphore is permitted to perform operations
on the protected resource. Only one thread at a time can own the mutex semaphore,
and the owner thread retains ownership  until it finishes executing its
critical section. When finished, the owner thread releases the mutex semaphore,
enabling another thread to become the owner.
<P>
When a thread requests ownership of a mutex semaphore that is already owned,
OS/2 blocks the thread. When more than one thread requests ownership of
the same semaphore, OS/2 queues the requests and grants subsequent ownership
based on the thread's priority and the order in which the requests were
received.
<P>
If more than one thread is blocked on a<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C3 3B --> DosRequestMutexSem
</A>request, then ownership is given to the thread that has the highest
priority level. If more than one of the waiting threads have the same priority
level, then FIFO ordering is used to determine which thread is unblocked
and given ownership of the semaphore.
<P>
For example, both thread 1 and thread 2 must write information to the same
disk file. Thread 1 claims ownership of an agreed-upon mutex semaphore and
starts writing its information to the file. If thread 2 also requests ownership
of the semaphore, it will be blocked. When thread 1 has finished writing
to the file, it releases the semaphore. OS/2 then unblocks thread 2 and
designates it as the new owner of the semaphore so that it can write to
the file.
<P>
During process termination, after delivery of process-termination exceptions
and unwind exceptions, if any threads in the process aside from Thread 1
(the main thread) own a mutex semaphore, ownership of the semaphore (and
therefore, the shared resource) passes to Thread 1. This gives Thread 1
a last chance to clean up the semaphore and the shared resource before the
process ends. If Thread 1 ends without releasing the semaphore, all threads
that are currently waiting on ownership of the semaphore will be unblocked
with the SEM_OWNER_DIED return code. Any thread that attempts to open it
or request ownership of the semaphore will receive a SEM_OWNER_DIED return
code.
<P>
The recommended way to clean up semaphores, and other resources, is for
each thread, especially Thread 1, to have an exception handler to handle
clean up during process termination (the XCPT_PROCESS_TERMINATE or XCPT_ASYNC_PROCESS_TERMINATE
exceptions). When it is not possible to register an exception handler for
a thread, (a DLL, for example, must de-register its exception handlers when
it returns control to the thread that called it), you should add a clean
up routine to the exit list of the process.
