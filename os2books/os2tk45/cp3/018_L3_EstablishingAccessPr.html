<H1>Establishing Access Protection</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->
<P>
When an OS/2 application commits a memory object, it specifies the types
of access permitted for the memory object. This can be done at the same
time the memory object is allocated, with<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C3 FC --> DosAllocMem</A>,
or at a later time, using<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC --> DosSetMem</A>.

<P>
Any combination of read, write, execute, or guard-page access can be set,
but at least read or write access must be specified when the memory object
is committed; it is not possible to commit an object with no access protection
attributes.
<P>
The application can also use<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 3F --> DosSetMem
</A>to change the access permission of pages within a previously committed
memory object. An application can permit read access to one page of the
memory object and write access to the rest.
<P>
When using<A><!-- external link: 1D EF C3 FC --> DosSetMem</A>, all the
pages in the range being changed must be either committed or decommitted.

<P>
The following code fragment commits a region of two pages within a previously
allocated memory object, and sets read-only access rights for the region.

<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    PVOID   pBaseAddress;       /* Pointer to the range of pages to be changed */
    ULONG   ulRegionSize;       /* Size, in bytes, of the region to be changed */
    ULONG   ulAttributeFlags;   /* Flag describing the page range              */
    APIRET  ulrc;               /* Return code                                 */

    ulRegionSize = 8192;        /* Specify a two-page region                   */

    /* Obtain the base address  */
    ulrc = DosAllocMem((PVOID *) &amp;pBaseAddress,
                       ulRegionSize,
                       PAG_WRITE);

    ulAttributeFlags = PAG_COMMIT |
                       PAG_READ;

    ulrc = DosSetMem(pBaseAddress,
                     ulRegionSize,
                     ulAttributeFlags);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosSetMem error: return code = %ld", ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>
