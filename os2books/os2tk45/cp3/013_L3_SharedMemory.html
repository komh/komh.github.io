<H1>Shared Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
Shared memory is memory that two or more applications can read from and
write to. Shared memory is prepared in such a way that any application can
receive a pointer to the memory and access the data. Applications must explicitly
request access to shared memory; the shared memory is protected from applications
that are not granted access.
<P>
There are two kinds of shared memory:  named and unnamed. For named shared
memory, any application that knows the name of the shared memory can access
it. For unnamed shared memory, a pointer to the shared memory must be passed
from the process that created the shared memory to the process being given
access. Access can be granted to any application; it is not necessary that
the process being granted access be related (parent-child) to the application
that created the shared memory.
<P>
Since memory sharing is done by sharing linear addresses, the linear address
range of the shared memory object is reserved in all process address spaces.

<P>
There are two basic methods of managing shared memory:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In one method, two or more applications share the
same memory at the same time. These applications read from and write to
the memory object, usually controlling access to the memory by using a semaphore.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In the other method of managing shared memory, one
application prepares data in memory, then passes that memory to another
application for further processing. The first application releases the memory
after passing it along, so that only one application accesses the memory
at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
