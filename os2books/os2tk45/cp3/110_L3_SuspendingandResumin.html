<H1>Suspending and Resuming Execution of a Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 115 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 04 C4 31 -->DosSuspendThread</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D DE C3 30 --> DosResumeThread
</A>are used to temporarily suspend the execution of a thread when it is
not needed and resume execution when the thread is needed.
<P>
These functions are best used when it is necessary for a process to temporarily
suspend execution of a thread that is in the middle of a task. For example,
consider a thread that opens and reads files from a disk. If other threads
in the process do not require input from these files, the process can suspend
execution of the thread so that OS/2 does not needlessly grant control to
it.
<P>
The specified thread might not be suspended immediately if it has some system
resources locked that must be freed first. However, the thread is not permitted
to execute further application program instructions until a corresponding
<A><!-- external link: 1D DE C3 30 -->DosResumeThread</A> is called.
<P>
A thread can only suspend another thread that is within its process.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D DE C3 30 -->DosResumeThread</A> is used to enable
the suspended thread to resume execution.
<P>
The following code fragment temporarily suspends the execution of another
thread within the same process. A subsequent call to<A><!-- external link: 1D DE C3 30 --> DosResumeThread
</A>restarts the suspended thread. Assume that the thread identifier of
the target thread has been placed int<I> ThreadID</I> already.

    APIRET  ulrc;            /* Return code       */

    ulrc = DosSuspendThread(tidThreadID);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosSuspendThread error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

    ulrc = DosResumeThread(tidThreadID);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
