<H1>Opening a Muxwait Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 173 -->
<P>
Processes other than the semaphore-creating process must use<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 4E --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem
</A>to gain access to the muxwait semaphore before they can use the semaphore
in any other muxwait semaphore function. All of the threads that belong
to the process that creates the muxwait semaphore have immediate access
to the semaphore.
<P>
The following code fragment opens a system muxwait semaphore.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    UCHAR   ucName[40];  /* Semaphore name           */
    HMUX    hmux;        /* Muxwait semaphore handle */
    APIRET  ulrc;        /* Return code              */

    strcpy(ucName,
           "\\SEM32\\MUXWAIT1");  /* Name of the system muxwait semaphore */

    ulrc = DosOpenMuxWaitSem(ucName,
                             &amp;hmux);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosOpenMuxWaitSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return,<I> hmux</I> contains the handle of the system muxwait
semaphore.
<P>
Opening a muxwait semaphore does not open the semaphores in its muxwait
list. A process must open each of the semaphores included in a muxwait semaphore
before it opens the muxwait semaphore. Otherwise,<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 4E --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem
</A>returns the ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE error value to the calling function.

<P>
Access to semaphores is on a per-process basis. Therefore, a semaphore that
has been opened by one thread in a process is open to all other threads
in that process as well.
<P>
Note that<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 4E --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A> merely
provides access to a muxwait semaphore. In order to wait for a muxwait semaphore
to clear, a thread must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 FC --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem</A>.

<P>
When a process no longer requires access to a muxwait semaphore, it closes
the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 FC --> DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A>.
However, if a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore
is closed by OS/2.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 4E --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A> increments
the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to 1 when the
semaphore is created and is decremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 FC --> DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted by OS/2.
<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A2 C3 4E --> DosOpenMuxWaitSem</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C3 4C -->DosCloseMuxWaitSem</A> can be nested,
but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535. If an attempt is
made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.
<P>
Even if the owner of a mutex semaphore in a muxwait-semaphore list has ended
without releasing the semaphore, the muxwait semaphore is still opened.
Subsequent calls to the muxwait semaphore will return ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED.
But because the process has opened the semaphore, it can then call<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 50 --> DosQueryMuxWaitSem
</A>to identify all the mutex semaphores in the muxwait list. Next, the
process can call<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C3 4F --> DosQueryMutexSem
</A>for each mutex semaphore in the list to find out which ones are in the
<I>Owner Died</I> state. Each mutex semaphore that returns ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED
from the query should be closed by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 67 C3 FC --> DosCloseMutexSem</A>.
Also, because semaphore handles can be reused, the mutex semaphores that
are closed should be deleted from the muxwait-semaphore list by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 78 C3 FC -->DosDeleteMuxWaitSem</A>.
