<H1>Using Muxwait Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 170 -->
<P>
A process that requires exclusive use of several shared resources at once
can use a multiple wait (muxwait) semaphore to obtain ownership of all the
mutex semaphores protecting the shared resources. A process can also use
a muxwait semaphore to wait on a group of event semaphores so that the process
continues running whenever events of interest occur.
<P>
A muxwait semaphore can refer to up to 64 event or mutex semaphores. An
application cannot refer to event and mutex semaphores in a single muxwait
semaphore, or include a muxwait semaphore in another muxwait semaphore.
