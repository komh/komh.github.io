<H1>Timing Repeated Intervals</H1><!-- entering slot 187 -->To count an interval repeatedly, an application
can use<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC --> DosStartTimer</A>. This function
starts a repeated-interval timer.
<P>
Unlike<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC --> DosAsyncTimer</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 4C --> DosStartTimer
</A>does not stop after the first interval is counted. The timer runs asynchronously
to the calling thread, enabling the thread to perform other operations while
it is waiting for the specified time intervals to expire. The system notifies
the application of the timer's expirations by posting an event semaphore.

<P>
The application resets the semaphore before starting the timer and whenever
the system posts the semaphore. The application can use the value returned
in the post-counting parameter by<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 4B --> DosResetEventSem
</A>to assure the semaphore was posted only once before it was reset.
<P>
The following code fragment starts a timer and then waits on and resets
the associated event semaphore. Assume that the handle of the targeted event
semaphore has been placed into<I> SemHandle</I>.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSDATETIME   /* Date and time values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    ULONG    ulTimeInterval;   /* Interval (milliseconds) */
    HSEM     hsemSemHandle;    /* Event-semaphore handle  */
    HTIMER   hHandle;          /* Timer handle (returned) */
    APIRET   ulrc;             /* Return code             */

    ulTimeInterval = 30000;    /* Set the periodic time interval to */
                               /* elapse every 30 seconds           */

    ulrc = DosStartTimer(ulTimeInterval,
                         hsemSemHandle,
                         &amp;hHandle);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosStartTimer error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
On successful return,<I> Handle</I> will contain the handle of this periodic
timer.<A><!-- external link: 1D FE C3 4D --> DosStopTimer</A> can be used
later to stop the periodic timer.
<P>
A repeated timer will continue to count the interval and post the semaphore
until the application terminates or the application uses<A><!-- external link: 1D FE C3 4D --> DosStopTimer
</A>to stop the timer explicitly. The following code fragment shows how
to stop a periodic timer that has been started previously with<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC --> DosStartTimer</A>:

<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSDATETIME   /* Date and time values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HTIMER   hHandle;     /* Handle of the timer */
    APIRET   ulrc;        /* Return code         */

    ulrc = DosStopTimer(hHandle);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosStopTimer error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Before starting the timer, the event semaphore must be reset. If the semaphore
does not exist, the thread can create it with<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>,
specifying its initial state as reset. If the semaphore was previously created
by the same process, the thread resets it by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.
If the semaphore was previously created by another process, then the thread
calls<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 4A --> DosOpenEventSem</A> to gain
access to the semaphore before calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.

<P>
Next, the thread calls<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC --> DosStartTimer</A>,
specifying the handle of the event semaphore and the desired time interval.
The thread can then perform other tasks. However, in order for the application
to be notified of the timer's expirations, one or more threads in the application
must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>.
<P>
When the time interval expires, the system posts the semaphore, and any
threads that were blocked on<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 4E --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>requests can resume their execution. Each time the semaphore is posted,
it must be reset with<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 4B --> DosResetEventSem
</A>before the next timer expiration.<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 4E --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>must also be called to wait for the semaphore to be posted again.
<P>
In addition to resetting the event semaphore,<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 4B --> DosResetEventSem
</A>returns the semaphore's post count (the number of times the semaphore
has been posted since the last time it was in the set state). An application
can use the post count to ensure that it has not missed a timer interval;
if the post count is greater than one, the application missed a timer interval.
