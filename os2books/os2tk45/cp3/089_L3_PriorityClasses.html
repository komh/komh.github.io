<H1>Priority Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 93 -->
<P>
OS/2 uses four priority classes to determine when a thread receives a time
slice:

<P>
A time-critical thread always receives a time slice before a fixed-high
thread, a fixed-high thread always receives a time slice before a regular
thread, and a regular thread always receives a time slice before an idle-time
thread.
<P>
<B>Time-Critical Threads</B>
<BR>
<I>Time-critical threads</I> have the highest priority class and execute
before any fixed-high, regular, or idle-time threads.
<P>
The time-critical class is for threads that must react to events outside
the system. For example, in a communications application, a thread responsible
for reading data from the communications device needs enough time to read
all incoming data. Because more than a regular time slice might be needed,
a time-critical classification ensures that the thread gets all the time
required.
<P>
Time-critical threads have a static priority that is not varied by OS/2.
They are scheduled among themselves in priority level order, with round-robin
scheduling of threads of equal priority.
<P>
Time-critical threads must be executed quickly, then free the CPU for other
work until another time-critical event occurs. This is important to maintain
good interactive responsiveness to the user and enable communications and
other time  critical applications to run concurrently. The time-critical
activity should, when possible, be in a thread separate from the rest of
the application, to isolate and minimize the time spent processing at the
time-critical level. A good rule of thumb is that a time-critical thread
should consist of no more than about 20,000 assembly language instructions.

<P>
<B>Fixed-High Threads</B>
<BR>
A<I> fixed-high thread</I> has a priority class that is lower than time-critical
but executes before any regular or idle-time threads. This class of threads
should be used to provide service for other threads where it is desirable
that the thread not be too sensitive to the foreground/background boost
provided by dynamic priority variation. A messaging thread, would be a good
example of this type of thread.
<P>
OS/2 varies the priority of a fixed-high thread around a base value according
to the activity of the thread and the system at any point in time. The base
value can be set by the thread itself.
<P>
<B>Regular Threads</B>
<BR>
A<I> regular thread</I> is the class that the majority of threads fall into.
No explicit action is necessary by the application to run at this priority,
it is the default.
<P>
OS/2 varies the priority level of a regular thread around a base value according
to the activity of the thread and the system at any point in time. The base
value can be set by the thread itself.
<P>
<B>Idle-Time Threads</B>
<BR>
An<I> idle-time</I> thread is one with very low priority that executes only
when there are no regular, fixed-high, or time-critical threads to execute.
Idle-time threads get CPU time only when there is no other work to do. The
<I>idle-time</I> class is for threads that need very little CPU time.
<P>
Idle-time threads have a static priority that is not varied by OS/2.
