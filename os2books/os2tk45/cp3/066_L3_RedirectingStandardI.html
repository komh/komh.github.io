<H1>Redirecting Standard I/O for Child Processes</H1><!-- entering slot 67 -->
<P>
An application can use unnamed pipes to redirect the standard input and
the standard output for a child process.
<P>
A typical use of an unnamed pipe is to read the output of a child process.
An application creates a pipe and then duplicates the standard output handle.
When the child process is started, its standard output will be written into
the pipe, where the application can read and display it. The following code
fragment shows how to do this:
<PRE>
    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS
    #define INCL_DOSNMPIPES

    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define PIPESIZE 256
    #define HF_STDOUT 1      /* Standard output handle */

    HPIPE hpR, hpW;
    RESULTCODES resc;
    ULONG ulRead, ulWritten;
    CHAR achBuf[PIPESIZE],
         szFailName[CCHMAXPATH];

    HFILE hfSave = -1,
          hfNew = HF_STDOUT;

    DosDupHandle(HF_STDOUT,
                 &amp;hfSave); /* Saves standard output handle      */

    DosCreatePipe(&amp;hpR,
                  &amp;hpW,
                  PIPESIZE); /* Creates pipe                      */

    DosDupHandle(hpW,
                 &amp;hfNew); /* Duplicates standard output handle */


    DosExecPgm(szFailName,
               sizeof(szFailName), /* Starts child process      */
               EXEC_ASYNC,
               (PSZ) NULL,
               (PSZ) NULL,
               &amp;resc,
               "DUMMY.EXE");

    DosClose(hpW);                /* Closes write handle to ensure     */
                                  /* Notification at child termination */

    DosDupHandle(hfSave,
                 &amp;hfNew);     /* Brings stdout back                */

    /*
     * Read from the pipe and write to the screen
     * as long as there are bytes to read.
     *
     */

    do {
        DosRead(hpR,
                achBuf,
                sizeof(achBuf),
                &amp;ulRead);

        DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
                 achBuf,
                 ulRead,
                 &amp;ulWritten);

    } while(ulRead);

</PRE>

<P>
A parent process can also use unnamed pipes to communicate with a child
process by redirecting both the standard input and the standard output for
the child process. To do this, the parent process:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Uses<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C3 3F --> DosDupHandle
</A>to redefine the read handle of one pipe as standard input (0000), and
the write handle of the other pipe as standard output (0001).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Starts the child process with<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC --> DosExecPgm</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Uses the remaining pipe handles to read and write
to the pipes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The parent process controls the meanings for standard I/O for the child
process. Thus, when the child process uses standard I/O handles with<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 43 --> DosRead
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>, it reads from
and writes to the pipes of its parent instead of reading from the keyboard
and writing to the display.
