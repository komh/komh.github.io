<P>
The TIMESLICE command in CONFIG.SYS sets the minimum and maximum amount
of processor time allocated to processes and programs for both OS/2 and
DOS sessions.
<P>
The first parameter selects the minimum TIMESLICE value in milliseconds.
This value is the minimum amount of time a thread is to be processed before
yielding the processor to a thread of the same priority level. This value
must be an integer greater than or equal to 32.
<P>
The second parameter selects the maximum TIMESLICE value in milliseconds.
The value of this parameter is the maximum amount of time a thread can be
processed before yielding processor time. This value must be an integer
greater than or equal to the minimum value, and less than 65536.
<P>
The default is<I> dynamic time slicing</I>, which varies the size of the
time slice depending on system load and paging activity. Dynamic time slicing
is designed to give the best performance in most situations.
