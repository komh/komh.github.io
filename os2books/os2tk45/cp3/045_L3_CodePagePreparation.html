<H1>Code Page Preparation</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
During system initialization, the code pages specified in the CODEPAGE statement
are prepared to enable run-time code page switching of the display, the
keyboard, the printer, and the country information. The display, keyboard,
and printer must be defined in a DEVINFO statement in order to be prepared.
Country information is prepared for the system country code specified in
the COUNTRY statement.
<P>
If a resource cannot be prepared for the selected code page during system
initialization, it is prepared for a default code page. The following are
the defaults:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A keyboard layout defaults to the code page of the
translate table designated as the default layout in the KEYBOARD.DCP file.
The default layout is based on the national code page of its associated
country. You must explicitly specify KEYBOARD.DCP in the DEVINFO statement
for the keyboard in CONFIG.SYS.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The display defaults to the code page of ROM_0 for
the device.
<P>
(ROM_0 means a device default code page that is the device native code page
or the lowest addressed ROM code page.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The printer defaults to the code page of ROM_0 for
the device.
<P>
(ROM_0 means a device default code page that is the device native code page
or the lowest addressed ROM code page.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The country information defaults to the code page
of the first entry found in the COUNTRY.SYS file for the country code. Each
entry is the same information for a given country code, but is encoded in
a different code page. The first entry is based on the preferred country
code page.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If country information cannot be prepared at system initialization because
it is not found in the COUNTRY.SYS file, for a code page selected with the
CODEPAGE statement, then it is prepared (maintained for run-time code page
switching in memory) in the default code page. Similarly, a keyboard layout
is prepared in its default code page if it cannot be prepared in the selected
code page, because it is not found in the KEYBOARD.DCP file.
<P>
COUNTRY.SYS contains one default entry per country code, and KEYBOARD.DCP
contains one default entry per keyboard layout based on these assignments.
