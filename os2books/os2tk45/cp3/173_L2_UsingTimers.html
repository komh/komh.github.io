<H1>Using Timers</H1><!-- entering slot 184 -->Applications frequently need to synchronize the
execution of threads, to cause an event to occur after a specified interval,
or to cause an event to occur at regular intervals. Timers are typically
used to enable an application to pause before processing user input or to
carry out a task at a given time.

OS/2 provides the following timer functions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 FC -->DosSleep</A> suspends
the execution of the calling thread, enabling other threads to run while
the calling thread sleeps.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC -->DosAsyncTimer
</A>starts a single-interval timer.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC -->DosStartTimer
</A>starts a repeated-interval timer.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A><!-- external link: 1D FE C3 FC -->DosStopTimer
</A>stops a single-interval or repeated-interval timer.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The system also provides two functions,<A><!-- external link: 1D 92 C3 3C --> DosGetDateTime
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D E4 C3 FC --> DosSetDateTime</A>, for getting
and setting the system date and time.
<P>
The timers that are started by<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 3B --> DosAsyncTimer
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 40 --> DosStartTimer</A> are asynchronous
timers; that is, the timers run independently of the calling thread, enabling
the calling thread to perform other operations while the timer is running.
When an asynchronous timer interval expires, the system notifies the application
by posting an event semaphore.
<P>
Time intervals for<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC --> DosAsyncTimer</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC -->DosStartTimer</A>, and<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 3F --> DosSleep
</A>are specified in milliseconds; however, it is important to recognize
that the actual duration of the specified time interval will be affected
by two factors:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the system clock keeps track of time in less
precise units known as<I> clock ticks</I>.  On most hardware, clock ticks
occur approximately 32 times a second, so each tick interval lasts approximately
31.25 milliseconds. (To determine the duration of a clock tick on your computer,
call<A><!-- external link: 1D D4 C3 FC --> DosQuerySysInfo</A>, and examine
the timer-interval field.)
<P>
Because clock ticks are less precise than millisecond values, any time interval
that is specified in milliseconds will essentially be rounded up to the
next clock tick.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, because OS/2 is a priority-based, multitasking
operating system, there is no guarantee that a thread will resume execution
immediately after the timer interval expires. If a higher priority process
or thread is running, or if a hardware interrupt occurs, the timed thread
blocks. (To minimize delays caused by preemptive scheduling, an application
can dedicate a thread to managing time-critical tasks, and then raise that
thread to a higher priority.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These factors usually cause the timer interval to be longer than requested;
however, it will generally be within a few clock ticks.
<P>
Timers for Presentation Manager applications are provided through the message
queue. Therefore, a Presentation Manager application will not use the timer
functions unless it performs some real-time control task.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the example code fragments that follow, error checking
was left out to conserve space. Applications should always check the return
code that the functions return. Control Program functions return an APIRET
value. A return code of 0 indicates success. If a non-zero value is returned,
an error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
