<H1>Thread Local Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
Thread local memory is a 128-byte region of thread-specific memory that
OS/2 assigns to a thread when the thread is created. Thread local memory
for each thread is always at the same virtual address, but each thread's
local memory region is backed by different physical memory, so the memory
is specific to each thread. This memory region is divided into 32 DWORDS
(4 bytes per DWORD), and is normally used to store a small number of pointers.

<P>
A thread can allocate thread local memory by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 FC --> DosAllocThreadLocalMemory</A>.
Thread local memory is freed by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 8F C3 FC --> DosFreeThreadLocalMemory</A>.

<P>
Note that thread local memory should be used sparingly. You should not use
the entire 128 byte region.
