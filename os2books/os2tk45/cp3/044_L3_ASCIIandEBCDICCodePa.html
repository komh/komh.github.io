<H1>ASCII and EBCDIC Code Page Support</H1><!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
The two leading character-coding systems are ASCII and EBCDIC. Presentation
Manager applications can use an EBCDIC code page instead of an ASCII code
page. Code pages based on both systems are supported by OS/2.
<P>
Any code page that either is defined in the CONFIG.SYS file, or is one of
the EBCDIC code pages supported, can be selected.
