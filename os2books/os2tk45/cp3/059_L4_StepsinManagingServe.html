<H1>Steps in Managing Server-Client Transactions</H1><!-- entering slot 60 -->
<P>
The following sequence summarizes the typical steps in the management of
a named pipe:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The server process creates the pipe by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 FC -->DosCreateNPipe</A>.<A><!-- external link: 1D 71 C3 32 --> DosCreateNPipe
</A>returns a handle for the server end of the pipe. (Note that the server
uses the same handle to both read from and write to the pipe.) The pipe
is now in the<I> disconnected state</I> and cannot be opened by a client
process. The server process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 31 --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>to put the pipe into a<I> listening state</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The pipe can now be opened by a client process.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A client process supplies the name of the pipe
in a call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 34 --> DosOpen</A> and receives
a pipe handle in return. (The client uses the same handle to both read from
and write to the pipe.) The pipe is now in the<I> connected state</I> and
can be read from or written to by the client.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The server and client processes communicate by
calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D7 C3 36 --> DosRead</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0F C4 FC --> DosWrite</A>.
DosResetBuffer can be used to synchronize read and write dialogs. A server
process that supports a large number of clients for a local named pipe can
use<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 38 --> DosSetNPipeSem</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C3 35 --> DosQueryNPipeSemState
</A>to coordinate access to the pipe. Server and client processes can also
use<A><!-- external link: 1D 07 C4 39 --> DosTransactNPipe</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 63 C3 2F --> DosCallNPipe
</A>to facilitate their communication.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After completing its transactions, the client
process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 30 --> DosClose</A> to close
its end of the pipe. The pipe is now in the<I> closing state</I> and cannot
be accessed by another client.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The server process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 7B C3 33 --> DosDisConnectNPipe
</A>to acknowledge that the client has closed its end of the pipe.  The
pipe is now in the disconnected state again.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To enable another client process to open the
pipe, the server must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 31 --> DosConnectNPipe
</A>again. This puts the pipe back into the listening state. To end its
access to the pipe, the server calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C3 FC --> DosClose</A>.
When all of the handles for both ends of the pipe have been closed, the
pipe is deallocated by the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
