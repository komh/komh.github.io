<H1>About Queues</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
A<I> queue</I> is a named, ordered list of elements that is used to pass
information between threads of the same (related) process or between different
(unrelated) processes.
<P>
Processes pass information to a queue in the form of elements. An element
is a 32-bit unit of information. Queue elements can be values, flags, pointers
to shared memory regions, anything that can fit into 32 bits. The format
of a queue element depends entirely on the process that creates the queue
(the queue owner). Only the queue owner can read elements from the queue;
other processes can only write to the queue. Reading an element automatically
removes it from the queue.
<P>
The process that creates the queue is known as the<I> server process</I> of
the queue. The other processes that access the queue are known as<I> client
processes</I>.
<P>
The owner of the queue (the<I> server process</I>) can choose the order
in which to read incoming information and can examine queue elements without
removing them from the queue. Queue elements can be added and accessed in
First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), or priority-based order.

<P>
Any process that has the name of a queue can open the queue and write to
it. The processes writing elements to the queue must use the format determined
by the queue owner.
<P>
Queues are very efficient. They pass only 32-bit sized elements, rather
than large data structures. However, queues can be used only for one-way
communication, because a client process can write to a queue but cannot
read from one.
<P>
Typically, processes use queues to transfer information about the contents
of a shared memory. The elements in the queue could contain the address
and length of data areas in shared memory objects. The sending process allocates
a shared memory object and gives access to the shared memory to the queue
owner. The sending process can free the shared memory after writing the
elements to the queue because the shared memory will not be deallocated
until the queue owner frees it.
<P>
Any thread in the process that owns the queue can examine queue elements
without removing them. This is called<I> peeking</I> at the queue.
<P>
OS/2 supplies the process identifier of the process that writes an element
to the queue, so that a process reading from or peeking at the queue can
determine the origin of the element. The process identifier is returned
as part of a<A><!-- external link: 1D C9 C4 89 --> REQUESTDATA</A> data
structure. Threads can use the ulData field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D C9 C4 89 --> REQUESTDATA
</A>data structure to pass additional information about the queue element.

<P>
If the queue is empty when a process attempts to read from it, the process
can either wait for an element to become available or continue executing
without reading from the queue. Semaphores can be used to indicate when
an element is in the queue.
