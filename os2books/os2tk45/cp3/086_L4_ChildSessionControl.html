<H1>Child Session Control</H1><!-- entering slot 90 -->
<P>
A session can be either a child session or an unrelated session. A child
session is under the control of the processes in the session that creates
it (the parent session). A process can select, set, or stop a child session
by using<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 FC --> DosSelectSession</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 FC --> DosSetSession</A>,
or<A><!-- external link: 1D FD C3 FC --> DosStopSession</A>, respectively.
<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 26 -->DosStartSession</A> returns a unique
session identifier for the child session for use in these functions.
<P>
A session can run in either the foreground or background. A process can
create a foreground session only if the creating process or one of its descendant
sessions is executing in the current foreground session. A process can move
a child session to the foreground by selecting the child session using the
session identifier and calling<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 FC --> DosSelectSession</A>.
A process can make a child session nonselectable by using<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 25 --> DosSetSession
</A>to change the SelectInd field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D D3 C4 59 --> STATUSDATA
</A>structure. This prevents the user from selecting the session from the
Window List but does not prevent a process from selecting the child session
by using<A><!-- external link: 1D E1 C3 FC --> DosSelectSession</A>.
<P>
A process can bind a child session to its own session by using<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 FC --> DosSetSession</A>.
Binding a session causes that session to move to the foreground whenever
the user selects the parent session from the Window List.
<P>
A parent session can use a session identifier with the<A><!-- external link: 1D F6 C3 25 --> DosSetSession
</A>function only if the parent session created the child session associated
with that identifier. It cannot use identifiers for child sessions created
by other parent processes. This is true for all session management functions.

<P>
Although a child session is related to the session that started it, the
processes in the child and original sessions are not related. This means
that even though<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 26 --> DosStartSession</A> supplies
the process identifier of the process in the child session, the process
identifier cannot be used with OS/2 functions such as<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C3 FC --> DosSetPriority</A>.
