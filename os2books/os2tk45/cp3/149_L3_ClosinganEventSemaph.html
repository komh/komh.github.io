<H1>Closing an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 157 -->
<P>
When a process no longer requires access to an event semaphore, it closes
the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 FC --> DosCloseEventSem</A>.

<P>
The following code fragment closes an event semaphore. Assume that the handle
of the semaphore has been placed into<I><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C4 4E --> HEV
</A></I>already.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    HEV     hev;     /* Event semaphore handle */
    APIRET  ulrc;    /* Return code            */

    ulrc = DosCloseEventSem(hev);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosCloseEventSem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 3B --> DosOpenEventSem</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 3A --> DosCloseEventSem
</A>can be nested, but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535.
If an attempt is made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.

<P>
If a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore is closed
by OS/2.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 3A --> DosCloseEventSem</A> decrements
the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to 1 when the
semaphore is created and is incremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 FC --> DosOpenEventSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted from OS/2. The
call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 3A --> DosCloseEventSem</A> that
decrements the usage count to 0 and causes the semaphore to be deleted is
referred to as the<I> final close</I>. If a thread attempts to perform the
final close for a semaphore while another thread in the same process is
still waiting for it, ERROR_SEM_BUSY is returned.
