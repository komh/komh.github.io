<H1>Freeing Memory</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
When memory object is no longer needed, the application uses the<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 30 --> DosFreeMem
</A>function to release the memory.
<P>
If applications do not release memory, the operating system either swaps
the memory to the hard disk (if swapping is enabled) or uses memory that
could be used by other applications. If OS/2 swaps the memory to the hard
disk, the SWAPPER.DAT swap file could become very large. Therefore, applications
should release memory as soon as it is no longer needed. Any memory that
is still allocated when the application ends is released by OS/2.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 30 -->DosFreeMem</A> frees a private or
shared memory object from the virtual address space of the process. The
released pages are returned to the system.
<P>
The following code fragment allocates 8192 bytes of committed memory and
then releases the memory:
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    PBYTE   pb;
    APIRET  ulrc;

    ulrc = DosAllocMem((PVOID *) &amp;pb,
                       8192,
                       fALLOC);    /* Allocate 8KB object */
        .
        .
        .
    ulrc = DosFreeMem(pb);         /* Free the object     */

</PRE>

<P>
