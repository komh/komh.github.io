<H1>Coordinating Access to a Local Named Pipe with Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 63 -->
<P>
When a process writes to a named pipe, the process at the other end (or
handle) of the pipe might require notification that data is available to
be read. Similarly, when a process reads from a named pipe, the process
at the other end might require notification that write space has become
available. As long as the communicating processes are on the same computer
system, shared event semaphores and muxwait semaphores can be used to provide
this notification. Using shared semaphores for this purpose is more efficient
than dedicating a thread to periodically poll each pipe, particularly when
a server process is communicating with a large number of client processes.
Whenever data is available in the pipe, the system posts a semaphore to
the server or client (whichever is reading from the pipe). This means that
the reading process can use DosWaitEventSem or<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 3A --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>to wait for data to arrive, rather than devote a thread to periodically
polling the pipe.
<P>
A process associates a semaphore with a named pipe by using<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 FC --> DosSetNPipeSem</A>.
First, create an event semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>,
specifying the initial state of the semaphore as<I> reset</I>. Then call
<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 38 -->DosSetNPipeSem</A> to attach the event
semaphore to a particular named-pipe handle. Up to two event semaphores
can be attached to each named pipe, one for the server process and one for
the client process. If there is already a semaphore associated with one
end of the pipe, that semaphore is replaced. A process can check the state
of the semaphores by using<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C3 FC --> DosQueryNPipeSemState</A>.

<P>
The server or client process must then call DosWaitEventSem. The particular
thread that calls this function will block until data is either read from
or written to the pipe. At that time, the system posts the event semaphore,
enabling the blocked thread to resume its execution.
<P>
If a process requires notification whenever any one of multiple named pipes
has been written to or read from, it can either attach the same event semaphore
to multiple pipes, or it can create a muxwait semaphore:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the same event semaphore is attached to multiple
pipes, then the<I> KeyHandle</I> parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 38 --> DosSetNPipeSem
</A>is used to assign a unique value to each pipe. After the event semaphore
has been posted, the process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C3 FC --> DosQueryNPipeSemState</A>.
This function returns information about each of the named pipes that are
attached to the semaphore, including key-handle values. The calling process
can use this information to determine which one of the named pipes has either
data or write space available.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->To use a muxwait semaphore, a process first creates
an event semaphore for each of the pipes that it wants to monitor. Each
semaphore must then be attached to a pipe by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D F1 C3 FC --> DosSetNPipeSem</A>.
Again, a unique key-handle value must be assigned to each pipe.
<P>
Next, the process calls DosCreateMuxWaitSem to create the muxwait semaphore,
specifying DCMW_WAIT_ANY as one of the<I> flAttr</I> flags. The muxwait
semaphore will consist of a linked list of the previously created event
semaphores.
<P>
The process calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C C4 3A --> DosWaitMuxWaitSem
</A>so that it will be notified the next time data is read from or written
to any of the pipes. However, it must call<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C3 37 --> DosQueryNPipeSemState
</A>to determine which one of the pipes is ready to be read from or written
to.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
