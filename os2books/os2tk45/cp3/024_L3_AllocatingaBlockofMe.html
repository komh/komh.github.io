<H1>Allocating a Block of Memory from a Heap</H1><!-- entering slot 24 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FF C3 34 -->DosSubAllocMem</A> allocates a block
of memory from a heap that was previously initialized by<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 FC --> DosSubSetMem</A>.
This is used when an application needs an area of memory that is smaller
than an entire heap.
<P>
The size of the memory block is rounded up to the next higher multiple of
8 bytes.
<P>
The following code fragment allocates a block of memory from a heap that
was previously initialized by<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 C4 FC --> DosSubSetMem</A>.
Assume that the<I> Offset</I> variable has been set to the address of the
initialized heap already.
<PRE>    #define  INCL_DOSMEMMGR   /* Memory Manager values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    PVOID    pOffset;         /* The heap to suballocate from                */
    PPVOID   ppBlockOffset;   /* Pointer to the variable where the offset of */
                              /* the suballocated memory block is returned   */
    ULONG    ulSize;          /* Size in bytes of the memory block requested */
    APIRET   ulrc;            /* Return code                                 */

    ulSize = 102;             /* Ask for 102 bytes.  This will be rounded    */
                              /* to 104 bytes (a multiple of 8 bytes).       */

    ulrc = DosSubAllocMem(pOffset,
                          &amp;ppBlockOffset,
                          ulSize);

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosSubAllocMem error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the address of the allocated block (from the heap) is stored
in the<I> BlockOffset</I> variable.
<P>
Remember to call<A><!-- external link: 1D 00 C4 35 --> DosSubFreeMem</A> to
free this block of memory when you are finished with it.
