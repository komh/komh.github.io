<H1>Opening an Event Semaphore</H1><!-- entering slot 156 -->
<P>
When a process creates an event semaphore, all of the threads that belong
to the process have immediate access to the semaphore.
<P>
Threads in other processes must open the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem
</A>before they can use the semaphore in any other event semaphore function.

<P>
The following code fragment shows how processes can open an event semaphore
that was created in a different process and then wait for the event to be
posted:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES   /* Semaphore values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HEV hevEventHandle = 0;                 /* Must be 0 because we are opening */
                                            /* the semaphore by name            */

    DosOpenEventSem("\\sem32\\wrtevent", &amp;hevEventHandle);

    DosWaitEventSem(hevEventHandle,
                    SEM_INDEFINITE_WAIT);   /* Waits until event is posted      */
        .
        .    /* Read from file when event is posted. */
        .
</PRE>

<P>
Applications can open an event semaphore by name or by handle. If the name
is used to open the semaphore, as in the code fragment above, the handle
parameter must be 0. If the handle is used to open the semaphore, the name
parameter must be NULL.
<P>
Access to semaphores is on a per-process basis. Therefore, a semaphore that
has been opened by one thread in a process is open to all other threads
in that process as well.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 -->DosOpenEventSem</A> merely provides
access to an event semaphore. In order to wait for an event semaphore to
be posted, a thread must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>.
In order to post or reset an open event semaphore, a thread uses<A><!-- external link: 1D A9 C3 41 --> DosPostEventSem
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 42 --> DosResetEventSem</A> respectively.

<P>
When a process no longer requires access to an event semaphore, it closes
the semaphore by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 FC --> DosCloseEventSem</A>.
If a process ends without closing an open semaphore, the semaphore is closed
by OS/2.
<P>
Each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem</A> increments
the usage count of the semaphore. This count is initialized to 1 when the
semaphore is created and is decremented by each call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 FC --> DosCloseEventSem</A>.
When the usage count reaches 0, the semaphore is deleted by OS/2.
<P>
Calls to<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 40 --> DosOpenEventSem</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 66 C3 3F --> DosCloseEventSem
</A>can be nested, but the usage count for a semaphore cannot exceed 65535.
If an attempt is made to exceed this number, ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPENS is returned.
