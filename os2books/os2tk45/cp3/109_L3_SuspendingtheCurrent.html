<H1>Suspending the Current Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
You can temporarily suspend the execution of the current thread for a set
amount of time by using<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 FC --> DosSleep</A>.
This function suspends execution of the thread for the specified number
of milliseconds.<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 1B --> DosSleep</A> is useful
when you need to delay the execution of a task. For example, you can use
<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 1B -->DosSleep</A> to delay a response when
the user presses a DIRECTION key. The delay provides the user with enough
time to observe the results and release the key.
<P>
The following code fragment uses<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 1B --> DosSleep
</A>to suspend execution of a thread for 1000 milliseconds (1 second):
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS       /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    DosSleep(1000);

</PRE>
