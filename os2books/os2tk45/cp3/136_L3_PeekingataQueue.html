<H1>Peeking at a Queue</H1><!-- entering slot 143 -->
<P>
The server process and its threads can examine a queue element by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 FC -->DosPeekQueue</A>. This function is
not available to client processes.
<P>
Unlike<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>,<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue
</A>does not remove the element from the queue.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D -->DosPeekQueue</A> can either examine
elements in the order that was specified when the queue was created (FIFO,
LIFO, or priority), or it can examine the next element in the queue after
a previous<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue</A> request
has been called. By making multiple<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue
</A>requests, the server process can search through a queue, examining each
element in turn. When it locates the element it is searching for, the server
process can remove the element from the queue by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 FC --> DosReadQueue</A>.

<P>
If several threads are using the same queue, the process writing to the
queue can use the ulData field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D C9 C4 B0 --> REQUESTDATA
</A>data structure to indicate that an element is directed to a particular
thread. The thread can peek at the queue whenever data is available and
read any elements containing the appropriate value in the ulData field.

<P>
The following code fragment shows how a thread can use<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue
</A>to examine the elements in a queue. Assume that a previous call to<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 4C --> DosOpenQueue
</A>provided the queue handle that is contained in<I> QueueHandle</I>. Assume
that the identifier of the process that owns the queue has been placed into
<I>OwningPID</I> already.

<P>
On successful return,<I> DataLength</I> contains the size of the element
on the queue that is pointed to by the pointer within<I> DataAddress</I>,
<I>ElementCode</I> has been updated to indicate the next queue element,
<I>ElemPriority</I> has been updated to contain the priority of the queue
element pointed to by<I> DataAddress</I>, and<I> Request.ulData</I> contains
any special data that the<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 51 --> DosWriteQueue
</A>caller placed into the queue.
<P>
If the queue is empty and<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_WAIT (0), the calling
thread waits until an element is placed in the queue. If the queue is empty
and<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_NOWAIT (1),<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue
</A>returns immediately with ERROR_QUE_EMPTY.
<P>
If<I> NoWait</I> is set to DCWW_NOWAIT, an event semaphore must be provided
so that the calling thread can determine when an element has been placed
in the queue. The semaphore is created by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>,
and its handle is supplied as a<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue
</A>parameter. The first time an event semaphore handle is supplied in a
<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D -->DosPeekQueue</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 50 --> DosReadQueue
</A>request for which DCWW_NOWAIT has been specified for a particular queue,
the handle is saved by the system. The same handle must be supplied in all
subsequent<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 4D --> DosPeekQueue</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 50 --> DosReadQueue
</A>requests that are called for that queue; if a different handle is supplied,
ERROR_<!-- entering slot 144 -->INVALID _ PARAMETERisreturned .
<P>
When a client process adds an element to the queue, the system automatically
opens the semaphore (if necessary) and posts it. The server can either call
<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 20 -->DosQueryEventSem</A> periodically
to determine whether the semaphore has been posted, or it can call DosWaitEventSem.
DosWaitEventSem causes the calling thread to block until the semaphore is
posted.
<P>
After the event semaphore has been posted, the calling thread must call
<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 1F -->DosPeekQueue</A> again to examine
the newly added queue element.
<P>
If QUE_CONVERT_ADDRESS is specified in the call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> DosCreateQueue</A>,
OS/2 will automatically convert 16-bit addresses to 32-bit addresses.
