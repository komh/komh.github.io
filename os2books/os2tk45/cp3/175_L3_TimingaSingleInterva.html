<H1>Timing a Single Interval</H1><!-- entering slot 186 -->To carry out other tasks while the timer counts
an interval, an application can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC --> DosAsyncTimer</A>.
This function sets a single-interval timer without stopping the application-the
timer runs asynchronously to the calling thread, enabling the thread to
perform other operations while it is waiting for the specified time interval
to expire. When the interval elapses, OS/2 notifies the application of the
expiration of the timer by posting an event semaphore. The application resets
the semaphore before starting the timer and monitors the semaphore to determine
when the time has elapsed. The application can use DosCreateEventSem with
the initial state FALSE to create a reset semaphore. For more information
on semaphores, see <A HREF="139_L1_Semaphores.html">Semaphores</A>.
<P>

<P>
The following code fragment creates an event semaphore and then calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 3C --> DosAsyncTimer
</A>to count an interval while the application performs other tasks:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSDATETIME    /* Date/Time and Timer Support */
    #define INCL_DOSSEMAPHORES  /* for semaphores              */

    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    HEV hev;
    HTIMER hTimer;

    /* First create a private, reset, event semaphore. */

    DosCreateEventSem((PSZ) NULL,
                      &amp;hev,
                      DC_SEM_SHARED,
                      FALSE);

    /* Start async (one-shot) timer; post semaphore in 10 seconds.  */

    DosAsyncTimer(10000,       /* Time in milliseconds (10 sec)     */
                  (HSEM) hev,  /* Semaphore handle                  */
                  &amp;hTimer);    /* Timer handle (used to stop timer) */

        .
        .    /* Do other processing here, then wait for semaphore.  */
        .

    DosWaitEventSem(hev,
                    SEM_INDEFINITE_WAIT);

</PRE>

<P>
Before starting the timer, the thread creates the event semaphore with<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C3 FC --> DosCreateEventSem</A>,
specifying its initial state as reset. If the semaphore was previously created
by the same process, the thread resets it by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.
If the semaphore was previously created by another process, then the thread
must call<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 3F --> DosOpenEventSem</A> to gain
access to the semaphore before calling<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 FC --> DosResetEventSem</A>.

<P>
Next, the thread calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 FC --> DosAsyncTimer</A>,
specifying the handle of the event semaphore and the desired time interval.
The thread can then perform other tasks. However, in order for the application
to be notified of the expiration of the timer, one or more threads in the
application must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 FC --> DosWaitEventSem</A>.

<P>
When the time interval expires, the system posts the semaphore, and any
threads that were blocked on<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 44 --> DosWaitEventSem
</A>requests can resume their execution. If another time interval is required,
the semaphore is reset, and both<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 3C --> DosAsyncTimer
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 0B C4 44 --> DosWaitEventSem</A> are called
again. (To time regular repeated intervals, use<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC --> DosStartTimer</A>.)

<P>
The timer can be canceled before its time interval expires by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D FE C3 FC --> DosStopTimer</A>.
