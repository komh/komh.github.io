<H1>Named and Anonymous Semaphores</H1><!-- entering slot 152 -->
<P>
A semaphore can be either named or anonymous. A named semaphore is always
shared; that is, it is always available to any process that knows the name.
An anonymous semaphore can be either private to a process or shared among
processes, depending on whether the application includes the DC_SEM_SHARED
flag in the function that creates the semaphore. A semaphore intended for
use solely among threads of the same process can be anonymous and private.

<P>
OS/2 creates a named semaphore when an application specifies a name in the
function that creates the semaphore. The name must have the following form:

<PRE>    \SEM32\SemName
</PRE>

<P>
The "\SEM32\" is required, though it need not be uppercase. The semaphore
name must conform to the rules for OS/2 file names, although no actual file
is created for the semaphore. If the application does not specify a name
in the function that creates the semaphore, OS/2 creates an anonymous semaphore.

<P>
OS/2 permits a system-wide maximum of 65536 (64K) shared semaphores. In
addition, each process can use up to 65536 (64K) private semaphores.
<P>
A shared muxwait semaphore must contain either all shared event semaphores
or all shared mutex semaphores. However, a private muxwait semaphore can
contain a combination of shared and private event or mutex semaphores. OS/2
generates a unique handle when it creates a semaphore. Processes must obtain
this handle before they can access the semaphore. A semaphore's handle is
always available to the process that created the semaphore. A process can
obtain the handle of a named semaphore created in another process by using
the appropriate semaphore-opening function. A process that requires access
to an anonymous shared semaphore that was created in another process must
obtain the handle of the semaphore through some other form of interprocess
communication, such as a pipe or a queue.
