<H1>Suspending the Current Thread</H1><!-- entering slot 185 -->An application can suspend a thread by using<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 FC --> DosSleep</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 2C -->DosSleep</A> suspends the execution
of the calling thread for a specified time interval.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 2C -->DosSleep</A> requires one argument-the
amount of time (in milliseconds) to suspend the thread. This value is rounded
up to the nearest clock tick. If a time interval of 0 is specified, the
thread gives up the remainder of the current time slice, enabling other
ready threads of equal or higher priority to run; the calling thread will
run again during its next scheduled time slice. If there is no other ready
thread of equal or higher priority,<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 2C --> DosSleep
</A>returns immediately; it does not yield to a thread of lower priority.

<P>
If there is a round-off error or if other threads in the system have higher
priority, a thread might not resume execution immediately after the sleep
interval.
<P>
The following<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 2C --> DosSleep</A> call suspends
a thread for at least 5 seconds:
<PRE>    DosSleep(5000);
</PRE>
Note that the specified time interval refers to execution time (accumulated
scheduled time slices), not to elapsed real time. Elapsed real time will
be longer and will vary, depending on the hardware and on the number and
priorities of other threads running in the system. In addition, even though
the calling thread is scheduled for execution as soon as the specified time
interval has elapsed, its execution could be delayed if a higher priority
thread is running or if a hardware interrupt occurs.
<P>
Because the above factors usually cause the sleep interval to be longer
than requested (though generally within a few clock ticks),<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 2C --> DosSleep
</A>should not be used as a substitute for a real-time clock.

(started by<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 2B --> DosAsyncTimer</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D FC C3 FC -->DosStartTimer</A>) will be much closer
to their specified time intervals because these timers run independent of
the execution of the calling thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
