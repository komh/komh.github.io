<H1>Creating an Exit List</H1><!-- entering slot 108 -->
<P>
You call<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 53 --> DosExitList</A> to add to
the exit list a routine that is to be given control when a process is ended
(or finishes its execution). Multiple routines can be added to the list.
When the process is ending, OS/2 transfers control to each address on the
list.
<P>
If there are multiple addresses on the list, each function gets control
in numerical order (with 0 being first and 0FFH being last), based on a
value supplied by the application when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 FC --> DosExitList</A>.
In case of duplicate entries for this parameter, the routines will be executed
in LIFO (last in, first out) order.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 53 -->DosExitList</A> requires a function
code that specifies an action and a pointer to the function that is to receive
control upon termination.
<P>
The following code fragment adds the locally defined function<I> SaveFiles
</I>to the exit list:
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS         /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;

    #define HF_STDOUT 1             /* Standard output handle    */

    VOID main(VOID)
    {
        .
        .
        .
        DosExitList(EXLST_ADD,
                    (PFNEXITLIST) SaveFiles);
        .
        .
        .
        DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS,
                0);
    }

    VOID APIENTRY SaveFiles(ULONG ulTermCode)
    {
        ULONG ulWritten;

        switch (ulTermCode) {
            case TC_EXIT:
            case TC_KILLPROCESS:
                 DosWrite(HF_STDOUT,
                          "Goodbye\r\n",
                          10,
                          &amp;ulWritten);
                 break;

            case TC_HARDERROR:
            case TC_TRAP:
                 break;

        }
        DosExitList(EXLST_EXIT,
                    0);
    }

</PRE>

<P>
Any function that you add to the list must take one parameter. The function
can carry out any task, as shown in the preceding example, but as its last
action it must call<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 FC --> DosExitList</A>,
specifying the EXLST_EXIT constant. An exit-list function must not have
a return value and must not call<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 52 --> DosExit
</A>to end.
<P>
When an exit-list routine receives control, the parameter (located at ESP+4
on the stack) contains an indicator of why the process ended. The values
returned are the same as those for termination codes returned by<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A C4 56 --> DosWaitChild
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 51 --> DosExecPgm</A> requests. These
values are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
TC_EXIT (0)<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Normal exit<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>TC_HARDERROR (1)<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Hard-error halt<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>TC_TRAP (2)<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Trap operation for a 16-bit child
process<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>TC_KILLPROCESS (3)<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Unintercepted DosKillProcess
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>TC_EXCEPTION (4)<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Exception operation for a
32-bit child process<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To execute the exit-list functions, OS/2 reassigns thread 1 after ending
all other threads in the process. If thread 1 has already exited (for example,
if it called<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 52 --> DosExit</A> without ending
other threads in the process), the exit-list functions cannot be executed.
In general, it is poor practice to end thread 1 without ending all other
threads.
<P>
Before transferring control to the termination routines, OS/2 resets the
stack to its initial value. Transfer is by way of an assembly language JMP
instruction. The routine must be in the address space of the ending process.
The termination routine at that address takes the necessary steps and then
calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 53 --> DosExitList</A> with FunctionOrder=EXLST_EXIT.
Control is then transferred to the next address in the invocation order
of the exit list. When all such addresses have been<!-- entering slot 109 --> processed,
the process completes exiting. If a routine on the list does not call<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 1E --> DosExitList
</A>at the completion of its processing, the process waits, and OS/2 prevents
termination.
<P>
During<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 1E --> DosExitList</A> processing,
the process is in a state of partial termination. All threads of the process
are ended, except for the one executing the exit-list routines. To ensure
good response to a user request to end a program, there should be minimal
delay in completing termination. Termination routines should be short and
fail-safe.
<P>
You can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 1E --> DosExitList</A> with the
EXLST_REMOVE constant to remove a function from the list.
<P>
The designer of an exit-list routine must carefully consider which functions
will be used by the routine. In general, calls to most OS/2 functions are
valid in a<A><!-- external link: 1D 86 C3 1E --> DosExitList</A> routine,
but certain functions, such as<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 1C --> DosCreateThread
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 83 C3 FC --> DosExecPgm</A>, are not.
