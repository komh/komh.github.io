<H1>About Program Execution Control-Thread, Processes, and Sessions</H1><!-- entering slot 81 -->
<P>
To successfully use multitasking-multiple processes and multiple threads-in
your programs, you need to understand the difference between a thread, a
process, and a session.
<P>
A<I> thread</I> is a dispatchable unit of execution that consists of a set
of instructions, related CPU register values, and a stack. Each process
has at least one thread, called the<I> main thread</I> or<I> thread 1</I>,
and can have many threads running simultaneously. The application runs when
OS/2 gives control to a thread in the process. The thread is the basic unit
of execution scheduling.
<P>
A<I> process</I> is the code, data, and other resources-such as file handles,
semaphores, pipes, queues, and so on-of an application in memory. OS/2 considers
every application it loads to be a process. System resources are allocated
on a per-process basis.
<P>
A<I> session</I> is one (or more) processes with their own virtual console.
(A virtual console is a virtual screen-either a character-based, full screen
or a Presentation Manager window-and buffers for keyboard and mouse input.)

<P>
OS/2 supports up to 255 concurrent sessions and up to 4095 processes. OS/2
supports a system-wide maximum of 4095 threads, but the number of threads
available in a single process will be lower, and will vary, because of resource
usage within the process.
