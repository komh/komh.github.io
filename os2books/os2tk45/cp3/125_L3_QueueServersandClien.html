<H1>Queue Servers and Clients</H1><!-- entering slot 131 -->
<P>
The server process and its threads have certain queue-managing privileges.
Only the server process and its threads can:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Examine queue elements without removing them (<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C3 20 -->DosPeekQueue</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Remove elements from the queue (<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C3 23 -->DosReadQueue</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Purge all the elements in a queue (<A><!-- external link: 1D B6 C3 21 -->DosPurgeQueue</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Write to the queue without opening it first (<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 24 -->DosWriteQueue</A>)
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Delete the queue (<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 1E -->DosCloseQueue</A>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Both server and client processes can query the number of elements in
the queue using<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C3 FC --> DosQueryQueue</A>.

<P>
Client processes can query the queue (<A><!-- external link: 1D D2 C3 22 -->DosQueryQueue</A>)
and add elements to it (DosWriteQueue), but they must first gain access
to the queue by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C3 FC --> DosOpenQueue</A>.
When a client process is finished with a queue, it ends its access to the
queue by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 FC --> DosCloseQueue</A>.
(Note that, unlike the server process and its threads, a client process
cannot use<A><!-- external link: 1D 69 C3 1E --> DosCloseQueue</A> to delete
a queue.)
<P>
When a queue is opened by a client process, an access count is set to 1.
Each client process has its own access count. The access count is incremented
whenever a thread in a process opens the queue and decremented whenever
a thread in the process closes the queue. Access to the queue by the client
process ends when the access count for the process reaches 0. When the server
process closes the queue, the queue is terminated and removed from the system.
