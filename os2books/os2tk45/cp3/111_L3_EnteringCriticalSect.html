<H1>Entering Critical Sections</H1><!-- entering slot 116 -->
<P>
A thread can prevent execution of any of the other threads in its process
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 FC --> DosEnterCritSec</A>.
<P>
This function temporarily prevents a thread from being preempted by other
threads within its process. The other threads in the process will not be
executed until the current thread calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 FC --> DosExitCritSec</A>.
This enables the calling thread to access a time-critical resource of the
process.
<P>
The following code fragment enters a section that will not be preempted,
performs a simple task, and then exits quickly.
<PRE>    #define INCL_DOSPROCESS     /* Process and thread values */
    #include &lt;os2.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    BOOL    flag;         /* Program control flag */
    APIRET  ulrc;         /* Return code          */

    ulrc = DosEnterCritSec();

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosEnterCritSec error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

    flag = TRUE;           /* Set the flag */

    ulrc = DosExitCritSec();

    if (ulrc != 0) {
        printf("DosExitCritSec error: return code = %ld",
               ulrc);
        return;
    }

</PRE>

<P>
A count is maintained of the outstanding<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 42 --> DosEnterCritSec
</A>requests. The count is incremented when a<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 42 --> DosEnterCritSec
</A>request is made, and decremented when a<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 43 --> DosExitCritSec
</A>request is made. A<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 43 --> DosExitCritSec
</A>request will not cause normal thread dispatching to be restored while
the count is greater than 0.
<P>
This count is maintained in a WORD-sized variable. If overflow occurs, the
count is set to its maximum value, and an error is returned. The operation
is not performed when this occurs.
<P>
Threads that call<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 42 --> DosEnterCritSec
</A>must not must not make dynamic link calls within these critical sections.
The dynamic link procedure could be using semaphores to serialize a resource.
If a thread entering the critical section blocks another thread that already
owns the resource which the dynamic link function is about to request, a
deadlock occurs.
<P>
For example, threads of an application are serializing their access to a
queue by means of a semaphore. A thread enters a critical section and makes
a request to read the queue while another thread already has the semaphore
that controls access to the queue. The thread that has the semaphore is
now effectively blocked by<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 FC --> DosEnterCritSec</A>,
and the thread that has requested the queue waits forever to access it.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Thread 1 is the initial thread of execution. It handles all
signals (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break, and KillProcess). If a signal occurs while
<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 42 -->DosEnterCritSec</A> is active, thread
1 can begin execution to process the signal. Thread 1 must not access the
critical resource that is being protected by the use of<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 FC --> DosEnterCritSec</A>.
