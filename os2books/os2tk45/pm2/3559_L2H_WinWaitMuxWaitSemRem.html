<H1>WinWaitMuxWaitSem - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 3574 -->
<P>
WinWaitMuxWaitSem is similar to DosWaitMuxWaitSem and enables a thread to
wait for a muxwait semaphore to clear or for a window message sent by the
WinSendMsg function from another thread to be received.
<P>
This function can be issued by any thread in the process that created the
semaphore.  Threads in other processes can also issue this function, but
they must first gain access to the semaphore by issuing DosOpenMuxWaitSem.

<P>
Since the processing of a window message may take longer than the value
specified by the<I> ulTimeout</I> parameter, this function may not return
within the time specified by that value.
<P>
If the main thread (which normally processes messages) is waiting on a semaphore
for a prolonged period of time, messages will not be processed, and the
"Bad App" dialog can occur. This is expected behavior. To avoid this, a
message-box can be displayed telling the user that the window is being initialized.
While the window loads, that message box can process the incoming system
messages.
