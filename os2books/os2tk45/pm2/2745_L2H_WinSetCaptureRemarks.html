<P>
This function assigns the pointing device capture to<I> hwnd</I>.
<P>
With the pointing device capture set to a window, all pointing device input
is directed to that window, regardless of whether the pointing device pointer
is over that window.
<P>
When this function (<I>hwndDesktop</I>, NULLHANDLE) is called to release
the pointing device capture, a<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C7 FC --> WM_MOUSEMOVE
</A>message is posted regardless of whether the pointing device pointer
has actually moved. This ensures that the window below the pointing device,
at that time, is able to change features, such as the shape of the pointing
device pointer.
<P>
If this function (<I>hwndDesktop</I>, HWND_THREADCAPTURE) is called, the
pointing device is captured to the current thread. Pointing device QMSGs
processed in this manner have NULLHANDLE window handles, and the pointing
device coordinates are relative to the screen.
<P>
This function returns an unlocked window handle.
<P>
It must only be called while processing pointing device or keyboard input.
A message box or dialog box must not be created while the pointing device
is captured.
