<H1>WinCreateStdWindow - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 409 -->
<P>
The window is created with zero width and depth and positioned at the bottom
left of the<I> hwndParent</I>, unless FCF_SHELLPOSITION is specified, in
which case the size and position are set by the shell. The window can be
positioned and sized by use of <A HREF="3163_L2_WinSetWindowPos.html">WinSetWindowPos</A>.

<P>
If WS_VISIBLE is set, the frame window is created visible. It is recommended
that standard windows that are not main windows are created with WS_VISIBLE
not set.
<P>
<I>hwndFrame</I> is the window handle of the frame window, that is, the
window of class WC_FRAME, and has a parent of<I> hwndParent</I>.
<P>
The frame window is created with identity<I> ulId</I>, all the component
windows, known as the frame controls, have the standard window identifiers
FID_*; see The identifier FID_CLIENT is used for the client area of the
window.
<P>
It may be necessary to change the<I> ulId</I> of the frame window after
it has been created, so that another frame window can be created with the
same resource tables, and still maintain distinct window identities. This
can be achieved with the <A HREF="3224_L2_WinSetWindowUShort.html">WinSetWindowUShort
</A>call.
<P>
Some combinations of frame control flags are valid, but leave visual holes
in the frame window.  Specifically, if the<I> pflCreateFlags</I> parameter
specifies any of FCF_SYSMENU, FCF_MINBUTTON, FCF_MAXBUTTON or FCF_MINMAX,
but not FCF_TITLEBAR, the area of the top title line between the optional
system menu and the minimize/maximize icons is not drawn by the default
frame window procedure.
<P>
None of the following can be used with WinCreateStdWindow:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WS_CLIPCHILDREN for the frame style<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->WS_CLIPSIBLINGS for the style of the client window
or any of the frame control windows<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->CS_CLIPSIBLINGS for the class style of the window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If any of the above are specified, the window is not redrawn correctly.
Any style can be used for the children of the client. If it really is required
that a client or a frame control is CLIPSIBLINGS, the application must ensure
that it is in front of the client and all the other frame controls, for
it to be drawn.
