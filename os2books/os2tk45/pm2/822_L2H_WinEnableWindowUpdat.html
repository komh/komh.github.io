<H1>WinEnableWindowUpdate - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 823 -->
<P>
This function can be used to defer drawing when making a series of changes
to a window. A window can be redrawn by using the <A HREF="3266_L2_WinShowWindow.html">WinShowWindow
</A>function.
<P>
WS_VISIBLE (style bit of a window) is set to<I> fEnable</I> without causing
redrawing. That is, if the window was previously visible, it remains visible
on the device when WS_VISIBLE is set to 0, and if the window was previously
invisible, it is not shown when WS_VISIBLE is set to 1. If<I> fEnable</I> is
set to TRUE, any subsequent drawing into the window is visible. If<I> fEnable
</I>is set to FALSE, any subsequent drawing into the window is not visible.

<P>
If the value of the WS_VISIBLE style bit has been changed, the<A><!-- external link: 1D A3 C7 FC --> WM_SHOW
</A>message is sent to the window of<I> hwnd</I> before the call returns.

<P>
Any alteration to the appearance of a window disabled for window update
is not presented.  Therefore, the application must ensure that the window
is redrawn. To show a window and ensure that it is redrawn after calling
the WinEnableWindowUpdate function with<I> fEnable</I> set to FALSE, use
the <A HREF="3266_L2_WinShowWindow.html">WinShowWindow</A> function with
<I>fNewVisibility</I> set to TRUE. In particular, if a window is destroyed
while in this state its image is not removed from the display.  After window
updating is reenabled, the application should ensure that the window gets
totally invalidated so that it repaints.
