<P>
This function is generally call during the processing of a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT
</A>message when the application needs to update the content of the window.

<P>
If the presentation space already exists, its update region is set and the
device context of the window is associated with the presentation space.
Otherwise, a cache presentation space is obtained specifically for the window.

<P>
The update region associated with<I> hwnd</I> is reset to NULLHANDLE. It
is assumed that any drawing following this function restores the content
of the window to a fully correct state.
<P>
This function hides the pointer if it is in the window and the <A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint
</A>function restores it.
<P>
This function hides the tracking rectangle if it is active and might hide
part of the painting window; that is, if<I> hwnd</I> is a child of the window
specified by the<I> hwnd</I> parameter in the <A HREF="3421_L2_WinTrackRect.html">WinTrackRect
</A>function. The <A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint</A> function
shows it again.
<P>
<A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint</A> must be called after the
application completes drawing, and can be nested for the same window.
