<P>
This function translates<I> pQmsg</I> if it is a<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR
</A>message in the accelerator table<I> haccelAccel</I>.  The message is
translated into a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC -->WM_SYSCOMMAND</A>, or<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C7 FC --> WM_HELP
</A>message, with<I> hwnd</I> identifying the destination window. Normally,
this parameter is a frame-window handle. This function does not highlight
menu items.
<P>
If<I> haccelAccel</I> equals NULL, the current accelerator table is assumed.

<P>
WinTranslateAccel returns TRUE if the message matches an accelerator in
the table.<I> pQmsg</I> is modified by WinTranslateAccel if a match is found.

<P>
If a menu item exists that matches the accelerator-command value, and that
item is disabled,<I> pQmsg</I> is translated to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C7 FC --> WM_NULL
</A>message, rather than a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC -->WM_SYSCOMMAND</A>, or<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C7 FC --> WM_HELP
</A>message. If the command is<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC --> WM_SYSCOMMAND
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C7 FC --> WM_HELP</A> (and if a<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC --> WM_SYSCOMMAND
</A>or FID_SYSMENU child window is searched) the menu child window of<I> hwnd
</I>that has the FID_MENU identifier is searched.
<P>
It is possible to have accelerators that do not correspond to items in a
menu.  If the command value does not match any items in the menu, the message
is still translated.
<P>
Generally, applications do not have to call this function; it is usually
called automatically by <A HREF="1069_L2_WinGetMsg.html">WinGetMsg</A> and
<A HREF="1672_L2_WinPeekMsg.html">WinPeekMsg</A>, when a<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR
</A>message is received with the window handle of the active window as the
first parameter.  The standard frame window procedure always passes<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND
</A>messages to the FID_CLIENT window.  Because the message is physically
changed by WinTranslateAccel, applications do not see the<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR
</A>messages that result in<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC -->WM_SYSCOMMAND</A>, or<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C7 FC --> WM_HELP
</A>messages.
