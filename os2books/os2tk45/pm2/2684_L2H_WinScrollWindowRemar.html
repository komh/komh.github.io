<P>
This function scrolls the contents of a rectangle defined by<I> prclScroll
</I>in the window<I> hwnd</I>, by<I> lDx</I> units horizontally and<I> lDy
</I>units vertically. All coordinates must be in device units.
<P>
Clipping takes place on the final image of the scrolling. Even if the scroll
rectangle lies outside the clip rectangle, these bits are scrolled, if their
destination lies within the intersection of the clip rectangle and the destination
rectangle.
<P>
This function returns an RGN_* value, indicating the type of invalid region
created by the scroll as returned by GpiCombineRegion. RGN_ERROR is returned
if<I> hwnd</I> is invalid.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If<I> hwnd</I> has style WS_CLIPCHILDREN, portions of any
child window within the scroll area are scrolled. In this instance, this
function must be called with<I> flOptions</I> SW_SCROLLCHILDREN.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
This is the only function that can be used by a thread to move bits within
its own window, because of the critical section nature of window update
regions.
<P>
Scrolling is fastest without SW_SCROLLCHILDREN and SW_INVALIDATERGN. When
scrolling needs to be repeated quickly, do not include the SW_INVALIDATERGN
flag and repaint the invalid area if the invalid region is rectangular,
otherwise invalidate and update.
<P>
If the scrolling is infrequent, include the SW_INVALIDATERGN flag. This
function invalidates and updates synchronous-paint windows automatically
before returning.
<P>
The cursor and the track rectangle are scrolled when they intersect with
the scrolled region. Any part of the window's initial update region that
intersects the scrolled region is also offset.
