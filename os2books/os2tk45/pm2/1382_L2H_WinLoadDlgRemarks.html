<H1>WinLoadDlg - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1383 -->
<P>
Unless window style WS_VISIBLE is specified for the dialog window in the
DIALOG statement within the dialog template, the dialog window is created
as an invisible window.
<P>
The dialog window owner may be modified, in order to ensure acceptable results
if it is later processed as a modal dialog using the <A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg
</A>or <A HREF="1009_L2_WinGetDlgMsg.html">WinGetDlgMsg</A> functions. A
search is made up the parent hierarchy, starting at the window specified
by the<I> hwndOwner</I> parameter, until a child of the window specified
by the<I> hwndParent</I> is found. If such a window exists, it is made the
actual owner of the dialog. If no such window exists the actual owner of
the dialog is set to NULLHANDLE.
<P>
This function returns immediately after creating the dialog window. A<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C5 FC --> WM_INITDLG
(Default Dialogs)</A> message is sent to the dialog procedure before this
function returns.
<P>
This function should not be used while pointing device capture is set (see
<A HREF="2739_L2_WinSetCapture.html">WinSetCapture</A>).
<P>
As each of the controls defined within the template of this dialog window
is created during the processing of this function, the dialog procedure
may receive various control notifications before this function returns.

<P>
A dialog window can be destroyed with the <A HREF="651_L2_WinDestroyWindow.html">WinDestroyWindow
</A>function.
<P>
Because windows are created from the template, strings in the template are
processed with <A HREF="3366_L2_WinSubstituteStrings.html">WinSubstituteStrings</A>.
Any resultant<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C7 FC --> WM_SUBSTITUTESTRING
</A>messages are sent to the dialog procedure before this function returns.

<P>
When the child windows of the dialog are created, the <A HREF="3366_L2_WinSubstituteStrings.html">WinSubstituteStrings
</A>function is used to allow the child windows to perform text substitutions
in their window text. If any of the child window text strings contain the
percent (%) substitution character, there is an upper limit of 256 on the
length of the text string, after it is returned from the substitution.
<P>
If a dialog template (typically compiled using the resource compiler) references
another resource (for example an icon resource for an icon static control),
this function always searches for that resource in the .EXE file. If an
application wishes to keep resources referenced by a dialog template in
a .DLL library, these resources must be loaded by an explicit function call
during the processing of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 79 C7 FC --> WM_INITDLG
</A>message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In general, it is better to create the dialog window invisible
as this allows for optimization. In particular, an experienced user can
type ahead, anticipating the processing in the dialog window.
<P>
In this instance, there may be no need to display the dialog window at all,
as the user might have finished the interaction before the window can be
displayed.
<P>
This is in fact how the <A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg
</A>function works; it does not display the dialog window while there are
still<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR</A> messages in the
input queue, but allows these to be processed first.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
