<H1>WinSetWindowPos - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 3187 -->
<P>
If a window created with the CS_SAVEBITS style is reduced, the screen image
saved is used to redraw the area uncovered when the window size changes,
if those bits are still valid.
<P>
If the CS_SIZEREDRAW style is present, the entire window area is assumed
invalid if sized. Otherwise,<A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C7 FC --> WM_CALCVALIDRECTS
</A>is sent to the window to inform the window manager which bits it may
be possible to preserve.
<P>
Messages sent from WinSetWindowPos and <A HREF="2967_L2_WinSetMultWindowPos.html">WinSetMultWindowPos
</A>have specific orderings within the window-positioning process.  The
process begins with redundancy checks and precalculations on every window
for each requested operation. For example, if SWP_SHOW is present but the
window is already visible, SWP_SHOW is turned off. If SWP_SIZE is present,
and the new size is equal to the old size, SWP_SIZE is turned off.
<P>
If the operations create new results, the information is calculated and
stored (for instance, when sizing or moving, the new window rectangle is
stored for later use).  It is at this point that the<A><!-- external link: 1D 4E C7 FC --> WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS
</A>message is sent to any window that is sizing or moving.  It is also
at this point that the<A><!-- external link: 1D 64 C7 FC --> WM_CALCVALIDRECTS
</A>message is sent to any window that is sizing and does not have the CS_SIZEREDRAW
window style.
<P>
When all the new window states are calculated, the window-management process
begins.  Window areas that can be preserved are moved from the old to the
new positions, window areas that are invalidated by these operations are
calculated and distributed as update regions. When this is finished, and
before any synchronous-paint windows are repainted, the<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C7 FC --> WM_SIZE
</A>message is sent to any windows that have changed size. Next, all the
synchronous-paint windows that can be are repainted, and the process is
complete.
<P>
If a synchronous-paint parent window has a size-sensitive area displayed
that includes synchronous-paint child windows, the parent needs to reposition
those windows when it receives the<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C7 FC --> WM_SIZE
</A>message. Their invalid regions are added to the parent's invalid region,
resulting in one update after the parent's<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C7 FC --> WM_SIZE
</A>message, rather than many independent (and later, duplicated) updates.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Some windows will not be positioned precisely to the parameters
of this function, but according to the behavior of their window procedure.
 For example, frame windows without a style creation flag of FCF_NOBYTEALIGN
will not position to any specific screen coordinate. Similarly, frame windows
with zero size and position are created by the <A HREF="396_L2_WinCreateStdWindow.html">WinCreateStdWindow
</A>function and therefore these values are treated as a special case by
the frame window procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Messages sent by this function are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 4C C7 FC -->WM_ACTIVATE</A><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Sent
if a different window becomes the active window. See also <A HREF="2728_L2_WinSetActiveWindow.html">WinSetActiveWindow</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 4E C7 FC -->WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL>Not sent if SWP_NOADJUST is specified.  The
message contains an SWP structure that has been filled in by this function
with the proposed move/size data. The window can adjust this new position
by changing the contents of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C8 CA --> SWP
</A>structure. If<I> hwnd</I> specifies a frame window, this function recalculates
the sizes and positions of the frame controls. If the new window rectangle
for any frame control is empty, instead of resizing or repositioning that
control, it is hidden if SWP_HIDE is specified. This eliminates needless
processing of windows that are not visible. The window rectangle of the
control in question is left in its original state.  For example, if WinSetWindowPos
is issued to change the size of a standard-frame window to an empty rectangle,
and <A HREF="2428_L2_WinQueryWindowRect.html">WinQueryWindowRect</A> is
issued against the client window, the rectangle returned is not an empty
rectangle, but the original client rectangle before WinSetWindowPos was
issued.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
