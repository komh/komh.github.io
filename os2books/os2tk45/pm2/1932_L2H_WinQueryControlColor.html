<P>
This function returns the colors (one or more) that are currently being
used by a control window of the type specified by<I> clrType</I>. If<I> hwnd
</I>is a valid control window handle, the colors being used by that window
are returned, including any presentation parameters it might be using. If
<I>hwnd</I> is set to HWND_DESKTOP, the default colors being used by that
window are returned.
<P>
To find out the default control colors for the current thread, specify CCF_APPLICATION.
Be sure to issue the call to WinQueryColors from the same thread that created
the control windows, otherwise the information returned will be incorrect.

<P>
To get all the colors used by a control window returned at once, specify
CCF_ALLCOLORS. You can call WinQueryColors with CCF_COUNTCOLORS first to
determine the buffer size you will need for the color information.
<P>
Each item in the returned array contains an index and value pair (CTLCOLOR).
If CCF_ALLCOLORS and CCF_COUNTCOLORS are not set, each item's index should
be set to a valid CCI_* constant for which a value is to be returned. The
values returned in the array are always valid RGB colors (including SYSCLR_*
values, which are actually indexes but can be used by graphics functions
in RGB mode).
<P>
If an invalid CCI_* index is specified, CCV_NOTFOUND is returned.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function can only be used for querying the colors of
standard PM controls.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
