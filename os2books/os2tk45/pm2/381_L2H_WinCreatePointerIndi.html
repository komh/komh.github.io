<P>
A pointer can be created either as a true pointer (at pointer size), or
as an icon pointer (at icon size).  The latter is useful when using icons
as direct-manipulation objects that the user can "pick up" and move about
the screen as a means of performing some operation (see also <A HREF="361_L2_WinCreatePointer.html">WinCreatePointer</A>).

<P>
This function makes copies of the supplied bit maps.
