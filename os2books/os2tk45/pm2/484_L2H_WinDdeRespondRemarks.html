<H1>WinDdeRespond - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 484 -->
<P>
This function is issued by a server application after receiving a<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C5 FC --> WM_DDE_INITIATE
</A>message that identifies this server application (or indicates that any
application can respond), and also either identifies a particular topic
which the server can support, or asks for all supported topics (see <A HREF="448_L2_WinDdeInitiate.html">WinDdeInitiate</A>).
This function sends a<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C5 FC --> WM_DDE_INITIATEACK
</A>message back to the client, that is the sender of the<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C5 FC --> WM_DDE_INITIATE
</A>message.
<P>
If the server application can respond, it issues this function once if a
specific topic was requested, or once for each topic which it can support,
if all supported topics were requested.
<P>
A DDE conversation is initiated each time this function is successfully
issued. The client is expected to terminate all unwanted conversations.
Once a conversation is initiated, it is controlled by the client issuing
<A HREF="461_L2_WinDdePostMsg.html">WinDdePostMsg</A> functions.
<P>
To support DDE conversations between applications running in different memory
models (16-bit and 32-bit) it is necessary to process all DDE messages in
the application window procedure. The use of the <A HREF="674_L2_WinDispatchMsg.html">WinDispatchMsg
</A>function ensures that conversion is performed on memory or segment addresses.
