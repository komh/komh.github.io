A window possesses a visibility state indicated by the WS_VISIBLE style
bit. When the WS_VISIBLE style bit is set, the window is shown and subsequent
drawing into the window is presented, unless that window is obscured by
some other window, or at least one of the windows upward in the parent chain
from<I> hwnd</I> does not have the WS_VISIBLE style.
<P>
When the WS_VISIBLE style bit is not set, the window is not shown ("hidden")
and subsequent drawing into the window is not presented, even if that window
is not obscured by another window.
