<P>
This function is required to complete the processing of a modal dialog window
and is called from its dialog procedure. It is made implicitly if the dialog
procedure passes a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A> message
to <A HREF="489_L2_WinDefDlgProc.html">WinDefDlgProc</A> or if a<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C7 FC --> WM_QUIT
</A>message is encountered during <A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg
</A>or <A HREF="1009_L2_WinGetDlgMsg.html">WinGetDlgMsg</A>.
<P>
This function hides the dialog window, and re-enables any windows that were
disabled by <A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg</A> or <A HREF="1009_L2_WinGetDlgMsg.html">WinGetDlgMsg</A>.

<P>
If the dialog window needs to be processed through <A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg</A>,
after being dismissed, the FF_DLGDISMISSED flag must be reset.
<P>
It does not destroy the dialog window; <A HREF="651_L2_WinDestroyWindow.html">WinDestroyWindow
</A>must be issued to destroy the dialog window when it is no longer needed.
However, <A HREF="684_L2_WinDlgBox.html">WinDlgBox</A> destroys the dialog
window it creates, when the dialog window is dismissed by the use of this
function.
<P>
This function can be issued during the processing of the the<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C5 FC --> WM_INITDLG
(Default Dialogs)</A> message.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This function can be made from a modeless dialog window, although
this is not necessary as there is no internal message processing loop. If
it is called, the dialog window is hidden and it is the responsibility of
the application to destroy the dialog window, if required.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
