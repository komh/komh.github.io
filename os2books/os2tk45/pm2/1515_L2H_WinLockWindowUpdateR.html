<P>
This function is used by threads that need to draw on an area of the screen
over which they have no control. For example, the user interface sizing
and moving calls use this call when drawing the shadow box, as a window
is sized or moved.
<P>
All threads continue to run while the window is disabled; only output is
prevented.
<P>
If one thread disables the window, other threads using this function are
blocked until the first enables the window, although they can still receive
messages.
<P>
This function does not prevent screen group switches, because these may
be necessary to handle "hard errors" in other screen groups.
