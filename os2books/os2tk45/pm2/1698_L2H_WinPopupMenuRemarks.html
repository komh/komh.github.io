<P>
A pop-up menu is the unanchored equivalent of a pull-down menu, that is
it can be positioned anywhere rather than being associated with an action
bar. Typically, pop-up menus are related to specific objects, such as an
icon, or with a particular area of the application's presentation space.

<P>
Once invoked, a pop-up menu behaves in exactly the same way as a pull-down
menu.
