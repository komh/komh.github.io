<H1>WinUnlockSystem - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 3481 -->
<P>
This function causes an application program to attempt to unlock the system
by passing a text string that can be compared against the system lockup
password that is stored in an encrypted form by the system.
<P>
If the string passed in matches the system lockup password, the lockup dialog
is dismissed and the user is able to use his machine. Otherwise, the system
remains in the locked up state.
<P>
OS/2 does not provide a method for querying<I> pszPassword</I> to find out
the password. It is up to the developer to ask the user what the password
is.
<P>
In order to execute WinUnlockSystem after a <A HREF="1489_L2_WinLockupSystem.html">WinLockupSystem
</A>has been called, the WinUnlockSystem must be called from a separate
thread because <A HREF="1489_L2_WinLockupSystem.html">WinLockupSystem</A> will
not return until a password has been entered from the keyboard.
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D AA C3 34 --> LockupHook</A> hook allows a PM
application to customize system lockups.
<P>
In order for the window to appear as the top most window on the lockup screen,
the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS flag must be used for the<I> flStyle</I> parameter in
the <A HREF="425_L2_WinCreateWindow.html">WinCreateWindow</A> or <A HREF="396_L2_WinCreateStdWindow.html">WinCreateStdWindow
</A>call.
