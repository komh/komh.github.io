<P>
The<I> pfntd</I> parameter is required and the<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG
</A>structure must be properly initialized.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the field in the<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG
</A>structure,<I> pfntd</I> must be a pointer to a<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG
</A>structure that is either static or allocated from the heap. This<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG
</A>structure must not be allocated on the stack.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Upon return, the<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG</A> structure
is updated with any user alterations and the field contains the value returned
by the font dialog's <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg</A> function.
By default this is the ID of the push button pressed to dismiss the dialog,
DID_OK or DID_CANCEL, unless the application supplied additional push buttons
in its template.
<P>
The pointer to the<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG</A> structure
is placed in the QWL_USER field of the dialog's frame window. If in a custom
font dialog procedure the pointer to the<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C7 25 --> FONTDLG
</A>structure is desired, it should be queried from the frame window with
<A HREF="2471_L2_WinQueryWindowULong.html">WinQueryWindowULong</A>.
<P>
To subclass the default font dialog with a new template, the application
must give the module and ID of the new font dialog template and the address
of a dialog procedure for message handling. Window IDs in the range 0x0000
through 0x0FFF are reserved for the font dialog controls. IDs from outside
this range must be chosen for any controls added to a custom font dialog.

<P>
When a modeless dialog is dismissed, the owner of the font dialog will receive
a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A> message with the
parameter equal to the ID of the font dialog.
