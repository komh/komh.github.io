<P>
If the enable state of<I> hwnd</I> is changing, a<A><!-- external link: 1D 70 C7 FC --> WM_ENABLE
</A>message is sent before this function returns.
<P>
If a window is disabled, its child windows are also disabled, although they
are not sent the<A><!-- external link: 1D 70 C7 FC --> WM_ENABLE</A> message.
Typically, a window changes appearance when disabled. For example, a disabled
push button is displayed with half-tone text.
<P>
If<I> hwnd</I> is disabled, and it, or one of its descendants, is the focus
window, that window loses the focus, so that no window has the focus. However,
a disabled window may subsequently be assigned the focus, in which case
it should respond to keyboard input.
