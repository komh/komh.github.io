- input<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> Switch data.
<P>
Contains information about the newly created Window List entry.
<P>
If the field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C8 5D --> SWCNTRL</A> structure
is NULL, the system uses the name under which the application is started.
This only applies for OS/2 programs, and only for the first call to this
function since the program started. Otherwise, a NULL entry name is invalid.

<P>
Leading and trailing blanks are removed from the title, which, if necessary,
is also truncated to 60 characters.
<P>
If the field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C8 5D --> SWCNTRL</A> structure
is NULLHANDLE, the value used by the system when the program was loaded
(if it has been loaded) is substituted.
<P>
If the field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C8 5D --> SWCNTRL</A> structure
is 0, the current process ID is used.
<P>
If the field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 7C C8 5D --> SWCNTRL</A> structure
is 0, the current session ID is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> Handle to the newly created Window List
entry.
<P>
There is a system limit to the number of Window List entries. However, this
is a large number (several hundred) and is unlikely to be reached in practice
since other system limits, such as memory size, are likely to be reached
first.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
