<P>
All windows being positioned must have the same parent.
<P>
It is more efficient to use this function than to issue multiple <A HREF="3163_L2_WinSetWindowPos.html">WinSetWindowPos
</A>functions, as it causes less screen updating. If specifies a frame window,
this function recalculates the sizes and positions of the frame controls.
If the new window rectangle for any frame control is to be empty, instead
of resizing or repositioning that control, it is hidden by (SWP_HIDE) instead.
This eliminates needless processing of windows that are not visible. The
window rectangle of the control in question is left in its original state.
 For example, if <A HREF="3163_L2_WinSetWindowPos.html">WinSetWindowPos
</A>is issued to change the size of a standard frame window to an empty
rectangle, and <A HREF="2428_L2_WinQueryWindowRect.html">WinQueryWindowRect
</A>is issued against the client window, the rectangle returned is not an
empty rectangle, but the original client rectangle before <A HREF="3163_L2_WinSetWindowPos.html">WinSetWindowPos
</A>was issued.
