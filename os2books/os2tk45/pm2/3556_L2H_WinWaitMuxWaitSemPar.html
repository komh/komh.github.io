<UL>Pointer to receive the user field.
<P>
A pointer to receive the user field (from the muxwait semaphore data structure)
of the semaphore that was posted or released.
<P>
If DCMW_WAIT_ANY was specified in the<I> flAttr</I> parameter when the muxwait
semaphore was created, this will be the user field of the semaphore that
was posted or released. If the muxwait semaphore consists of mutex semaphores,
any mutex semaphore that is released is owned by the caller.
<P>
If DCMW_WAIT_ALL was specified in the<I> flAttr</I> parameter when the muxwait
semaphore was created, this will be the user field of the<I> last</I> semaphore
that was posted or released. (If the thread did not block, the last semaphore
that was posted or released will also be the last semaphore in the muxwait-semaphore
list.) If the muxwait semaphore consists of mutex semaphores, all of the
mutex semaphores that are released are owned by the caller.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
