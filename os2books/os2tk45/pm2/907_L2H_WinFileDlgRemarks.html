<H1>WinFileDlg - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 908 -->
<P>
The<I> pfild</I> parameter is required and the<A><!-- external link: 1D F5 C7 21 --> FILEDLG
</A>structure must be properly initialized.
<P>
On return, the<A><!-- external link: 1D F5 C7 21 --> FILEDLG</A> structure
is updated with any user alterations, and the field is set to the value
returned by the file dialog's <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg
</A>function. By default, this is the ID of the push button pressed to dismiss
the dialog, DID_OK or DID_CANCEL, unless the application supplied additional
push buttons in its template.
<P>
For convenience, the pointer to the<A><!-- external link: 1D F5 C7 21 --> FILEDLG
</A>structure is placed in the QWL_USER field of the dialog's frame window.
If in a custom file dialog procedure the pointer to the<A><!-- external link: 1D F5 C7 21 --> FILEDLG
</A>structure is desired, it should be queried from the frame window with
the <A HREF="2471_L2_WinQueryWindowULong.html">WinQueryWindowULong</A> function.

<P>
To subclass the default file dialog with a new template, the application
must give the module and ID of the new file dialog template and the address
of a dialog procedure for message handling. Window IDs in the range 0x0000
through 0x0FFF are reserved for the standard file dialog controls. IDs from
outside this range must be chosen for any controls or windows added to a
custom file dialog.
<P>
When a modeless dialog is dismissed, the owner of the file dialog will receive
a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND</A> message with the
the ID of the file dialog.
