</A>function. To get one of the standard system pointers, use the <A HREF="2266_L2_WinQuerySysPointer.html">WinQuerySysPointer

The pointer is owned by the process from which this function is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists
when the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.
