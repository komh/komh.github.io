<P>
The window to be destroyed must have been created by the thread that is
issuing this call. Before<I> hwnd</I> is itself destroyed, all child windows
of<I> hwnd</I> are also destroyed.
<P>
If<I> hwnd</I> cannot be destroyed, for example because<I> hwnd</I> is an
invalid window handle or is not associated with the current thread,<I> rc
</I>returns FALSE.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If<I> hwnd</I> is locked, this call does not return until
the window is unlocked (and destroyed).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Messages may be received from other processes or threads during the processing
of this call.
<P>
If a Presentation Space is associated with the window, it is disassociated
from it by this function. If the presentation space was obtained by use
of GpiCreatePS then it is disassociated from the window, but not destroyed.
That is, this function calls GpiAssociate to disassociate the presentation
space but does not call GpiDestroyPS. If the presentation space was obtained
by use of the <A HREF="1105_L2_WinGetPS.html">WinGetPS</A> function, it
is released by this function; that is, this function performs the <A HREF="2572_L2_WinReleasePS.html">WinReleasePS
</A>function.
<P>
Messages sent by this call are:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C7 FC -->WM_DESTROY</A><!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> Always
sent to the window being destroyed after the window has been hidden on the
device, but before its child windows have been destroyed. The message is
sent first to the window being destroyed, then to the child windows as they
are destroyed. Therefore, during processing the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6E C7 FC --> WM_DESTROY
</A>it can be assumed that all the children still exist.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 4C C7 FC --> WM_ACTIVATE
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL>Sent with if the window being destroyed is the
active window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C5 FC --> WM_RENDERALLFMTS
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL>Sent if the clipboard owner is being destroyed,
and there are unrendered formats in the clipboard.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the window being destroyed is the active window, both the active window
and the input focus window are transferred to another window when the window
is destroyed. The window that becomes the active window is the next window,
as defined for the "Alt+Esc" function. This usually corresponds to the next
application in the sequence. The input focus transfers to whichever window
the new active window decides should have it.
<P>
If a menu window is being destroyed, any bit maps associated with the menu
are not deleted.  They will be deleted automatically when the application
terminates.
