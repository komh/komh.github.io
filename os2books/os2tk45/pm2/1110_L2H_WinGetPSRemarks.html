<P>
The presentation space created by this method is a cache "micro presentation
space" present in the system. This can be used for simple drawing operations
that do not depend on long-term data being stored in the presentation space.

<P>
The initial state of the presentation space is the same as that of a presentation
space created using GpiCreatePS. The color table is in default color index
mode. The visible region associated with<I> hps</I> depends upon the window
and class styles of<I> hwnd</I>:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Style</B><!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL><B> Visible region of presentation space
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WS_CLIPCHILDREN<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> All
child windows of the window are excluded.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> WS_CLIPSIBLINGS
<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL>All the sibling windows of<I> hwnd</I> are excluded.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CS_PARENTCLIP<!-- lm: 0x2 23 -->
<UL> Is the same
as that of the parent window of the window.
<P>
The presentation space origin is established normally, that is, relative
to the lower left of the window itself, not its parent.
<P>
This style optimizes the use of the presentation space cache by minimizing
the calculation of the visible region for child windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any presentation space created by WinGetPS must be released by calling <A HREF="2572_L2_WinReleasePS.html">WinReleasePS</A>.
This should be done before the application terminates.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This call requires the presence of a message queue and should
not be made until after the application's message queue has been created.
