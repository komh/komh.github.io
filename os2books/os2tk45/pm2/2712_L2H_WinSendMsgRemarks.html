<P>
<I>mresReply</I> is the value returned by the window procedure that is invoked.
For standard window classes, the values of<I> mresReply</I> are documented
with the message definitions.
<P>
This function does not complete until the message has been processed by
the window procedure whose return value is returned in<I> mresReply</I>.

<P>
If the window receiving the message belongs to the same thread, the window
function is called immediately as a subroutine. If the window is of another
thread or process, the operating system switches to the appropriate thread
that enters the necessary window procedure recursively. The message is not
placed in the queue  of the destination thread.
<P>
If a message is sent from one process to another and the message contains
a pointer, the receiving process may not have read/write access to the memory
referenced by the pointer. If the receiving process is expected to update
that memory, this must be done using shared memory. For more information
about Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) and shared memory, see "Dynamic Data Exchange"
section of the<I><I> Presentation Manager Programming Guide - Advanced Topics</I>.
