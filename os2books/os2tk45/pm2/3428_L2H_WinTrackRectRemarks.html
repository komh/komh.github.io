<H1>WinTrackRect - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 3442 -->
<P>
The WinTrackRect call provides general-purpose pointing-device tracking.
It draws a rectangle and enables the user to position the entire rectangle,
or size a specific side or corner, as required. The resulting rectangle
is then returned to the application, which can use this new information
for size and position data. The window manager interface for moving and
sizing windows by means of the wide sizing borders uses this function, for
example.
<P>
This function enables the caller to control such limiting values as:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A maximum and minimum tracking size<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Absolute tracking-position limits<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The tracking rectangle side widths<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A restriction of tracking rectangle movements to a
predefined positional grid.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
It automatically calls <A HREF="1509_L2_WinLockWindowUpdate.html">WinLockWindowUpdate
</A>to prevent output in the window<I> hwnd</I> and its descendants while
tracking. When tracking has been completed, output is enabled before this
function returns. It also determines which button of the pointing device
is depressed at the start of the operation, and only completes the tracking
operation when the same button is released.
<P>
If the parameter of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C8 D2 --> TRACKINFO
</A>structure specified by the value is included, the pointing device pointer
is positioned at the center of the tracking rectangle. Otherwise, the pointing
device pointer is not moved from its current position and<I> delta</I> is
established between the pointing device position and the part of the tracking
rectangle that it moves (the<I> delta</I> is kept constant).
<P>
While moving or sizing with the keyboard interface, the pointing device
pointer is repositioned with the tracking rectangle's new size or position.

<P>
While tracking, these keys are active:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Enter<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Accepts the new position or size.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Left
cursor<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Moves the pointing device pointer and tracking
rectangle left.
<P>
If the pointing device pointer is on the upper or lower edge of the tracking
rectangle, the pointer is moved to the top-left or bottom-left corner respectively.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Up cursor<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Moves the pointing
device pointer and tracking rectangle up.
<P>
If the pointing device pointer is on the left or right edge of the tracking
rectangle, the pointer is moved to the top-left or top-right corner respectively.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Right cursor<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Moves the pointing
device pointer and tracking rectangle right.
<P>
If the pointing device pointer is on the upper or lower edge of the tracking
rectangle, the pointer is moved to the top-right or bottom-right corner
respectively.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Down cursor<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Moves
the pointing device pointer and tracking rectangle down.
<P>
If the pointing device pointer is on the left or right edge of the tracking
rectangle, the pointer is moved to the bottom-left or bottom-right corner
respectively.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Esc<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Cancels
the current tracking operation. The value of the tracking rectangle is undefined
on exit.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The pointing device and the keyboard interface can be intermixed. The caller
need not include the value to use the keyboard interface, as this value
simply initializes the position of the pointing device pointer.
<P>
If is specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C8 D2 --> TRACKINFO</A> structure,
the interior of the tracking rectangle is restricted to multiples of the
values of the parameters. The default values for these are the system font
character width and half the system font character height, respectively.

<P>
Tracking movements using the keyboard arrow keys depend on whether or not
is specified in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 80 C8 D2 --> TRACKINFO</A> structure,
If not specified, the increments are the values of the keyboard arrow keys
do not cause tracking.
<P>
The tracking rectangle is usually logically "on top" of objects it tracks,
so that the user can see the old size and position while tracking the new.
Thus, it is possible for a window "below" the tracking rectangle to be updated
while part of the tracking rectangle is "above" it.
<P>
Because the tracking rectangle is drawn in exclusive-OR mode, no window
can draw below the tracking rectangle (and thereby obliterate it) without
first notifying the tracking code, because unwanted areas of the tracking
rectangle can be left behind. If the window doing the drawing is clipped
out from the window in which the tracking is occurring, this problem does
not arise.
<P>
To prevent a window that is currently processing a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT
</A>message drawing over the tracking rectangle, the tracking rectangle
is considered as a system-wide resource, only one of which can be in use
at any time. If there is a risk of the currently-updating window drawing
on the tracking rectangle, the tracking rectangle is removed while that
window and its child windows<!-- entering slot 3443 --> update, and it is
then replaced. This is done during the <A HREF="054_L2_WinBeginPaint.html">WinBeginPaint
</A>and <A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint</A> functions. If
the tracking rectangle overlaps, it is removed in the <A HREF="054_L2_WinBeginPaint.html">WinBeginPaint
</A>function. In the <A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint</A> function,
all the child windows are updated by means of the <A HREF="3470_L2_WinUpdateWindow.html">WinUpdateWindow
</A>function before the tracking rectangle is redrawn.
<P>
WinTrackRect has a modal loop within it. The loop has a HK_MSGFILTER hook
and a MSGF_TRACK hook code.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The rectangle tracked by this function stays within the specified
tracking bounds and dimensions. If the rectangle passed is out of these
bounds, or it is too large or too small, it is modified to a rectangle that
meets these limits.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
