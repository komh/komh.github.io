<P>
When a string of the form "%n" (where n is in the range 0 through 9) occurs
in the source string, a<A><!-- external link: 1D A6 C7 FC --> WM_SUBSTITUTESTRING
</A>message is sent to the specified window. This message returns a text
string to use as a substitution for "%n" in the destination string, which
is otherwise an exact copy of the source string.
<P>
If "%%" occurs in the source, "%" is copied to the destination, but no other
substitution occurs. If "%x" occurs in the source, where x is not a digit
or "%", the source is copied unchanged to the destination. The source and
destination strings must not overlap in memory.
<P>
This function is particularly useful for displaying variable information
in dialogs, menus, and other user-interface calls. Variable information
can include such things as file names, which cannot be statically declared
within resource files.
<P>
This function is called by the system while creating child windows in a
dialog box. It allows the child windows to perform textual substitutions
in their window text.
