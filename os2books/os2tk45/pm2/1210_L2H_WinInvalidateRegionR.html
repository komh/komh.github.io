<P>
The update region is a subregion of a window that is deemed "invalid" or
incorrect in visual terms and is in need of redrawing.
<P>
If the window has a CS_SYNCPAINT style, it is redrawn during the processing
of this function and the update region should be NULL on return from this
function.
<P>
If the window has a WS_CLIPCHILDREN style with part of its update region
overlapping child windows with a CS_SYNCPAINT style, those children are
updated before this function returns.
<P>
This function should not be called in response to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT
</A>request for windows of style CS_SYNCPAINT. CS_SYNCPAINT means that windows
are updated synchronously when invalidated, which generates a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT
</A>message. Thus, invalidating  the window in response to a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT
</A>message would cause another invalidate, another<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C7 FC --> WM_PAINT</A>,
and so on.
