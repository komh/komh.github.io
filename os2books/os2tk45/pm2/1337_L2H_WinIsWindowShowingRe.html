<P>
This function is useful for applications that constantly output new information.
If value FALSE is returned (that is, no part of the window is physically
visible), the application can choose not to redraw, since redrawing is not
necessary.
<P>
If an application is using WinIsWindowShowing, it must issue the call every
time it has new information that needs to be updated. If this is not done,
invalid screen content could result. The alternative to this approach for
a constantly-updating application that has new information is for it to
invalidate its window and redraw within a <A HREF="054_L2_WinBeginPaint.html">WinBeginPaint
</A>- <A HREF="838_L2_WinEndPaint.html">WinEndPaint</A> sequence.
<P>
FALSE is returned if the PM session is not currently visible.
