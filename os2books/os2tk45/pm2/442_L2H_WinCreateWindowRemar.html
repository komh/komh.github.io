<P>
The appearance and behavior of a window are determined by its style, which
is the combination of the style established by<I> pszClass</I> and<I> flStyle
</I>ORed together. Any of the standard styles WS_* can be used in addition
to any class-specific styles that may be defined.
<P>
A window is usually created enabled and invisible.  For more information
on the initial state of a created window, see the list of the standard window
styles.
<P>
Messages may be received from other processes or threads when this function
is called.
<P>
This function sends the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6C C7 FC --> WM_CREATE
</A>message to the window procedure of the window being created.
<P>
This function sends the<A><!-- external link: 1D 4E C7 FC --> WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS
</A>message after the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6C C7 FC --> WM_CREATE</A> message,
and before the window is displayed (if applicable).  The values passed are
those given to the WinCreateWindow function. If the window has style WS_VISIBLE,
the window is created visible.
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C7 FC --> WM_SIZE</A> message is not sent
by the WinCreateWindow function while the window is being created.  Any
required size processing can be performed during the processing of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 6C C7 FC --> WM_CREATE
</A>message.
<P>
Because windows are often created with zero height or width and sized later,
it is good practice not to perform any size-related processing if the size
of the window is zero.
<P>
If the WinCreateWindow function is called for a window of class WC_FRAME,
the controls specified by are created but not formatted. The frame is formatted
when a<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C7 FC --> WM_FORMATFRAME</A> message
is received but this is not sent during window creation. To cause the frame
to format, either a<A><!-- external link: 1D 75 C7 FC --> WM_FORMATFRAME
</A>message must be sent, or the window position adjusted using the <A HREF="3163_L2_WinSetWindowPos.html">WinSetWindowPos
</A>function call which sends a<A><!-- external link: 1D A5 C7 FC --> WM_SIZE
</A>message if the position or size is changed.
<P>
The only limitation to the size and position specified for a window is the
number range allowed for the size and position parameters; that is, an application
can create windows that are larger than the screen or that are positioned
partially or totally off the screen. However, the user interface for manipulation
of window sizes and positions is affected if part or all of the window is
off the screen.
<P>
It is recommended that part of the title bar be left on the screen, if the
window has one, to enable the user to move the window around.
<P>
When a WC_MENU window is created with this call,<I> pCtlData</I> is assumed
to be a menu template, which is used to create the menu. If<I> pCtlData
</I>is NULL, an empty menu is created.
