<H1>WinMessageBox - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 1573 -->
<P>
The message box consists of a message and a simple dialog with the user.

<P>
This function behaves in a similar way to <A HREF="684_L2_WinDlgBox.html">WinDlgBox</A>,
and the remarks concerning modality which are documented under that call,
and also under the <A HREF="1372_L2_WinLoadDlg.html">WinLoadDlg</A> and
<A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg</A> functions, also apply
here.
<P>
This function should not be used while pointing device capture is set (see
<A HREF="2739_L2_WinSetCapture.html">WinSetCapture</A>).
<P>
If the keyboard is used to cycle from one window to the next, the message
box and its parent window are considered to be next to each other in the
sequence.
<P>
If a message box is created as part of the processing of a dialog window,
where the dialog window has not been dismissed, the dialog window should
be made the owner of the message box window.
<P>
If a system modal message box is created to indicate to the user that the
system is running out of memory, the strings passed into this call must
not be taken from a resource file, as an attempt to load the resource file
could fail because of the lack of memory. However, such a message box can
safely use the hand icon because this icon is always memory-resident.
<P>
The size of the message box is determined as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The minimum width of a message box is enough to display
40 characters of average width.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The minimum height of a message box is enough to display
2 lines.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The text of a message box is word-wrapped by default.
If more than two lines are required to display the text, the height of the
message box is increased up to a maximum of two thirds of the screen height.
The height of a message box can never exceed this value.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If necessary, the width of a message box is increased
to allow room to display the title.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Text is wrapped at word boundaries (spaces).  If a word is too big to fit
on one line, the start of the word is not wrapped to the next line, but
stays adjacent to the text it follows, and the word is split at the box
boundary.
<P>
The message box is centered on the screen.
<P>
If a message box window has a CANCEL button, the MBID_CANCEL value is returned
if either the Escape key is pressed or the Cancel button is selected. If
the message box window has no CANCEL button, pressing the Escape key has
no effect.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a dialog box or a message box is up for a window, and the
parent or owner of that window is destroyed, the code following the WinDlgBox
or WinMessageBox call is executed even though the parent/owner window no
longer exists. This can result in accessing data that no longer exists;
especially data referenced in the window words. Therefore, it is extremely
important to determine the state of your child-window procedure after this
function returns. The most straightforward method for doing this is to call
WinQueryWindowPtr to get a pointer to the window words. If the returned
pointer is NULL, then you should exit immediately. Should this be the case,
the bottom-up rule (that is, the child window gets WM_DESTROY messages first,
then the parent window) still applies, and it becomes the child window procedure's
responsibility to exit gracefully.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
