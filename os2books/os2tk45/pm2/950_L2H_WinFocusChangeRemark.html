<P>
This function sends a<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C7 FC --> WM_FOCUSCHANGE
</A>message to the window that is losing the focus and a<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C7 FC --> WM_FOCUSCHANGE
</A>message to the window that is receiving the focus.
<P>
This function fails if another process or thread is currently using this
function.
<P>
Other messages may be sent as a consequence of the frame control processing
of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C6 FC --> WM_FOCUSCHANGE (in Frame Controls)
</A>message, depending on the value of the<I> flFocusChange</I> parameter.
These messages, if sent, are sent in this order:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

Also, there is a short period during the time after the old active window
has acted on the deactivation message and before the new active window has
acted on the activation message when the <A HREF="1784_L2_WinQueryActiveWindow.html">WinQueryActiveWindow
</A>function returns NULLHANDLE.
<P>
This function should not be made unless it is directly or indirectly the
result of operator input.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Even if FC_NOSETSELECTION is not specified, the<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C7 FC --> WM_SETSELECTION
</A>is not sent to a frame window that is already selected. This can occur
if the focus is being transferred from a parent to a child window and FC_NOLOSESELECTION
was specified.
