<P>
This function is equivalent to the <A HREF="943_L2_WinFocusChange.html">WinFocusChange
</A>call in which the<I> flFocusChange</I> parameter is set to 0.
<P>
If no window has the input focus,<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR
</A>messages are posted to the queue of the active window and are not thrown
away.
<P>
When this function is called a<A><!-- external link: 1D 82 C7 FC --> WM_MOUSEMOVE
</A>message is posted regardless of whether the pointing device pointer
has actually moved.  This ensures that the window below the pointing device,
at that time, is able to change features, such as the shape of the pointing
device pointer.
<P>
This function requires the existence of a message queue.
