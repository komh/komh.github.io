<P>
This must be the first PM call issued by any application thread using Presentation
Manager facilities.
<P>
It returns<I> hab</I>, which is NULL if the initialization is not successful.

<P>
The operating system does not generally use the information supplied by
the<I> hab</I> parameter to its calls; instead, it deduces it from the identity
of the thread that is making the call. Thus an OS/2 application is not required
to supply any particular value as the<I> hab</I> parameter. However, in
order to be portable to other environments, an application must provide
the<I> hab</I>, that is returned by the WinInitialize function of the thread,
to any OS/2 function that requires it.
<P>
<I>flOptions</I> determines the initial state of message processing with
respect to a created window.
