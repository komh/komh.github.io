<P>
The use of parameters to this function are the same as those of the <A HREF="1372_L2_WinLoadDlg.html">WinLoadDlg
</A>function.
<P>
This function should not be used while pointing device capture is set (see
<A HREF="2739_L2_WinSetCapture.html">WinSetCapture</A>).
<P>
This function does not return until <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg
</A>is called.
<P>
This function is equivalent to:
<PRE><A HREF="1372_L2_WinLoadDlg.html">WinLoadDlg</A> (., ., ., ., ., ., dlg);
<A HREF="1742_L2_WinProcessDlg.html">WinProcessDlg</A> (dlg, result);
<A HREF="651_L2_WinDestroyWindow.html">WinDestroyWindow</A> (dlg, success);
return  (result);
</PRE>

<P>
and the remarks documented under these calls also apply.
<P>
If a dialog template (typically compiled using the resource compiler) references
another resource (for example an icon resource for an icon static control),
this function always searches for that resource in the .EXE file. If an
application wishes to keep resources referenced by a dialog template in
a .DLL library, these resources must be loaded by an explicit function call
during the processing of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 79 C7 FC --> WM_INITDLG
</A>message.
<P>
This can be considered to be a customizable "read from screen" call. The
caller supplies a data buffer (the<I> pCreateParams</I> parameter), filled
with initial values. It receives a return code which indicates whether the
data in the buffer has been updated and validated, or whether the end user
cancelled the dialog. The end user interface is encapsulated within the
dialog window.  The dialog template provides a view of the current state
of the data buffer, the dialog procedure defines how the user can change
the data. The caller need know nothing about the details of the end user
interface.  It makes a single "read from screen" call and continues with
its work.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If a dialog box or a message box is up for a window, and the
parent or owner of that window is destroyed, the code following the WinDlgBox
or WinMessageBox call is executed even though the parent/owner window no
longer exists. This can result in accessing data that no longer exists;
especially data referenced in the window words. Therefore, it is extremely
important to determine the state of your child-window procedure after this
function returns. The most straightforward method for doing this is to call
WinQueryWindowPtr to get a pointer to the window words. If the returned
pointer is NULL, then you should exit immediately. Should this be the case,
the bottom-up rule (that is, the child window gets WM_DESTROY messages first,
then the parent window) still applies, and it becomes the child window procedure's
responsibility to exit gracefully.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
