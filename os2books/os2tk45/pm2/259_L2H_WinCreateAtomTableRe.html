<P>
The atom table is owned by the process from which this function is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it is still in
existence when the process terminates, it will automatically be deleted
by the system.
<P>
There is a system atom table which is created at boot time, which cannot
be destroyed, and which can be accessed by any process in the system.  The
handle of the system atom table is queried with the <A HREF="2288_L2_WinQuerySystemAtomTa.html">WinQuerySystemAtomTable
</A>function.
