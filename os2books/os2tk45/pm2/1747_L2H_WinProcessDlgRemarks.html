<P>
If the dialog has an owner window, that window is disabled. This means that
all user input to the owner, and its descendants, is prevented.
<P>
This function then dispatches messages from the queue to the appropriate
window or dialog procedure until the dialog is dismissed by <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg</A>.
This is usually done by the dialog procedure on receipt of an appropriate
message, but also occurs if the dialog procedure passes a<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND
</A>message to <A HREF="489_L2_WinDefDlgProc.html">WinDefDlgProc</A> or
if the<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C7 FC --> WM_QUIT</A> message is encountered
before the dialog window is dismissed. In this latter case, WinProcessDlg
itself issues <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg</A>, and
posts the<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C7 FC --> WM_QUIT</A> message back
to the queue so that the application main loop terminates in the normal
way.
<P>
This function shows the window, if it is hidden, when the queue is empty.
It is therefore possible for the experienced user to type ahead and cause
the dialog to be dismissed before it becomes visible.
<P>
If the dialog window needs to be processed through WinProcessDlg, after
being dismissed, the FF_DLGDISMISSED flag must be reset.
<P>
<A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg</A> hides the dialog window
without destroying it, and also re-enables any window that was disabled
by this function.
<P>
This function does not return until a <A HREF="662_L2_WinDismissDlg.html">WinDismissDlg
</A>call is issued in one of the ways listed above. This is true even if
the application main window has not been disabled, for example because the
dialog window has no owner. In this case, the dialog will appear to the
user to be modeless; the user will continue to be able to interact with
the application, and possibly create multiple instances of the dialog. In
such circumstances the operating system calls the application main window
procedure recursively before WinProcessDlg returns.
<P>
It is not possible to temporarily disable more than one window using this
function; a dialog window can have at most one owner. If an application
has more than one main window which should be disabled while the modal dialog
is displayed, it can be done by setting appropriate hooks using <A HREF="2893_L2_WinSetHook.html">WinSetHook</A>.

<P>
If the dialog window is a descendant of its owner, this function disables
input to the dialog itself. However, this situation can only occur by explicitly
changing the window hierarchy. Dialog windows are created using <A HREF="1372_L2_WinLoadDlg.html">WinLoadDlg
</A>or <A HREF="279_L2_WinCreateDlg.html">WinCreateDlg</A>, which modify
the owner window specified on their parameter lists.
