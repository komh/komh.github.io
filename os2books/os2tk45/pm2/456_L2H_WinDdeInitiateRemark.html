<P>
This function sends a<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C5 FC --> WM_DDE_INITIATE
</A>message to all top level frame windows. These are windows registered
with CS_FRAME, whose parent is the desktop window. No message is sent to
object windows.
<P>
The WinDdeInitiate function does not return to the client application until
all receiving applications have, in sequence, processed the<A><!-- external link: 1D D8 C5 FC --> WM_DDE_INITIATE
</A>message, and the client application has received all the corresponding
<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C5 FC -->WM_DDE_INITIATEACK</A> messages (see
<A HREF="475_L2_WinDdeRespond.html">WinDdeRespond</A>).
<P>
To support DDE conversations between applications running in different memory
models (16-bit and 32-bit) it is necessary to process all DDE messages in
the application window procedure. The use of the <A HREF="674_L2_WinDispatchMsg.html">WinDispatchMsg
</A>function ensures that conversion is performed on memory or segment addresses.
