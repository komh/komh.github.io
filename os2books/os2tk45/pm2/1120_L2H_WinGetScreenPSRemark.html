<P>
Take great care when using this method. The returned presentation space
is not clipped to any of the other windows present on the screen. Thus it
is possible to draw in regions belonging to windows of other threads and
processes.
<P>
The <A HREF="1509_L2_WinLockWindowUpdate.html">WinLockWindowUpdate</A> function
should be used to avoid simultaneous updates to the same part of the screen.
This does not cause the presentation space returned by this function to
become clipped in any way. Care of the appearance of windows of other threads
is still the responsibility of the user of the screen presentation space.

<P>
When the application finishes using the screen presentation space, it should
be destroyed using the <A HREF="2572_L2_WinReleasePS.html">WinReleasePS
</A>call.
