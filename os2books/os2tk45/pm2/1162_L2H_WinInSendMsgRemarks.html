<P>
If the message is from another thread this function determines whether or
not the message was initiated by the active thread. The "active thread"
is the thread associated with the current active window. (See also the <A HREF="1305_L2_WinIsThreadActive.html">WinIsThreadActive
</A>function.)
<P>
Typically this function is used by applications to determine how to proceed
with errors when the window processing the message is not the active window.
For example, if the active window uses the <A HREF="2704_L2_WinSendMsg.html">WinSendMsg
</A>function to send a request for information to another window, the other
window cannot become active until it returns control from the <A HREF="2704_L2_WinSendMsg.html">WinSendMsg
</A>function. The only methods an inactive window has to inform the user
of an error are to create a message box (see <A HREF="1562_L2_WinMessageBox.html">WinMessageBox</A>),
or to flash a window (see <A HREF="932_L2_WinFlashWindow.html">WinFlashWindow</A>).

<P>
This function can be used to tell if a function is being called recursively.
