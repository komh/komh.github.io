<P>
This function must be called by the same thread that created the cursor
that is affected.
<P>
A cursor show-level count is maintained. It is incremented by a hide operation
and decremented by a show operation. The cursor is actually visible if the
cursor show-level count is zero, otherwise it is invisible. When decrementing,
the cursor show-level count is fixed at zero so as not to show the cursor
too many times, but it is possible to hide the cursor a number of times
in succession.
