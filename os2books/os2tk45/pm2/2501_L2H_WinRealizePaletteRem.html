<H1>WinRealizePalette - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 2507 -->
<P>
This function is typically used after GpiSelectPalette or in response to
a<A><!-- external link: 1D 98 C7 FC --> WM_REALIZEPALETTE</A> message. It
causes the system to ensure that the palette is appropriately realized for
all drawing operations.
<P>
When the window has the input focus, the palette will be realized absolutely.
Otherwise, the realization is on a best-can-do basis. If the palette is
larger than the currently associated device can support, as many entries
as possible are realized, starting from the lowest index.
<P>
If the presentation space is currently associated with a device context
of type OD_MEMORY (see<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> DevOpenDC</A>),
then this function performs no function other than returning without error.

<P>
This function must not be called while processing a<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C7 FC --> WM_SETFOCUS
</A>message, because a window's activation state is not known until processing
of this message is complete.
<P>
Note that the palette cannot be physically changed on all devices. The effect
of this call is therefore device dependent.
