<P>
If system or queue hooks are installed, they are called before this function
returns.
<P>
<I>rc</I> is generally used to determine when to terminate the application's
main loop and exit the program.
<P>
<I>hwndFilter</I> constrains the returned message to be for a specific window
or its children. When<I> hwndFilter</I> is null, the returned message can
be for any window. The message identity is restricted to the range of message
identities specified by<I> ulFirst</I> and<I> ulLast</I> inclusive. When
<I>ulFirst</I> and<I> ulLast</I> are both zero, any message satisfies the
range constraint. When<I> ulFirst</I> is greater than<I> ulLast</I>, messages
except those whose identities lie between<I> ulFirst</I> and<I> ulLast</I> are
eligible to be returned. Messages that do not conform to the filtering criteria
remain in the queue.
<P>
When<I> hwndFilter</I> is null, and<I> ulFirst</I> and<I> ulLast</I> are
both zero, all messages are returned in the order that they were posted
to the queue.
<P>
By using filtering, messages can be processed in an order that is different
from the one in the queue. Filtering is used in situations where applications
receive messages of a particular type, rather than having to deal with other
types of message at an inconvenient point in the logic of the application.
For example, when a "mouse down" message is received, filtering can be used
to wait for the "mouse up" message without having to be concerned with receiving
other messages.
<P>
These constants can also be used when filtering messages:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
WM_MOUSEFIRST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Lowest value pointing device message
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WM_MOUSELAST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Highest value pointing device
message<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WM_BUTTONCLICKFIRST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Lowest value pointing device
button click message<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WM_BUTTONCLICKLAST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Highest value pointing device
button click message<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WM_DDE_FIRST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Lowest value DDE message<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>WM_DDE_LAST<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Highest value DDE message.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Great care must be taken if filtering is used, to ensure that a message
that satisfies the specification of the filtering parameters can occur,
otherwise this function cannot complete. For example, calling this function
with<I> ulFirst</I> and<I> ulLast</I> equal to<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR
</A>and with<I> hwndFilter</I> set to a window handle that does not have
the input focus, prevents this function from returning.
<P>
Keystrokes are passed to the <A HREF="3434_L2_WinTranslateAccel.html">WinTranslateAccel
</A>call, which implies that accelerator keys are translated into<A><!-- external link: 1D 68 C7 FC --> WM_COMMAND
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D A8 C7 FC --> WM_SYSCOMMAND</A> messages,
and so are not seen as<A><!-- external link: 1D 65 C7 FC --> WM_CHAR</A> messages
by the application.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> An application must be prepared to receive messages other
than those documented in this publication. All messages that an application
does not want to handle should be dispatched to the appropriate window procedure
using the <A HREF="674_L2_WinDispatchMsg.html">WinDispatchMsg</A> function.
