<P>
Input processing can enter a "system modal" state. In this state, all pointing
device and keyboard input is directed to a special window, known as the
system-modal window, or to one of its child windows (or a window owned by
one of them).  An "owned" window is a window that refers to its owner window
set by using either the<I> hwndOwner</I> parameter of the <A HREF="425_L2_WinCreateWindow.html">WinCreateWindow
</A>function or the<I> hwndNewOwner</I> parameter of the <A HREF="2989_L2_WinSetOwner.html">WinSetOwner
</A>function. All other main windows behave as though they are disabled
and no interaction is possible with them.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The disabled windows are not actually disabled, but made noninteractive.
No messages are sent to these windows when the system-modal state is entered
or left, and their WS_DISABLE style bits are not changed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Where a system-modal window exists and another window is explicitly made
the active window, the newly activated window becomes the system-modal window.
 This replaces the old one, which becomes a noninteractive window. When
the system-modal window is destroyed, the system-modal state is ended, and
input processing returns to its normal state.
<P>
This function should only be called while processing pointing device or
keyboard input.
<P>
The new system-modal window is<B> not</B> locked during the processing of
this function.
