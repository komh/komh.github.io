<P>
When an application registers a private class with the window procedure
in a dynamic link library, it is the application's responsibility to resolve
the window-procedure address before issuing this function.
<P>
A private class must not be registered with the same name as a public class
in the same process.
<P>
However, if a private class is registered with the same name as one that
already exists, the parameters replace the old class parameters, and the
return value is TRUE. The window procedure of an existing window can be
changed using <A HREF="3355_L2_WinSubclassWindow.html">WinSubclassWindow
</A>or <A HREF="3180_L2_WinSetWindowPtr.html">WinSetWindowPtr</A>. The style
of an existing window can be changed with the <A HREF="3212_L2_WinSetWindowULong.html">WinSetWindowULong
</A>or <A HREF="3224_L2_WinSetWindowUShort.html">WinSetWindowUShort</A> functions.
The number of bytes of storage allocated for application use cannot be changed
once the window is created.
<P>
Private classes are deleted when the process that registers them terminates.
