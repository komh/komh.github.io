<P>
A local system uses remote error reporting to notify a remote managing system
that an error has occurred.  You must enable remote error reporting by added
the<B> /r</B> option on the SMSTART statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
The remote error-reporting application on the local system monitors the
error log.  When the system records an error, the remote error-reporting
application converts the error into a Desktop Management Interface (DMI)
indication and notifies the SystemView Agent of the error.  The SystemView
Agent converts the indication into an SNMP trap and sends the trap to a
remote error-managing system.  The indications that the remote error-reporting
application creates are also available to local system applications through
the DMI Management Interface.
<P>
As the system records errors through use of the FFSTProbe function, the
remote error logging application uses the logging event-notification functions
to receive the error log entries.  The remote error logging application
translates the entries into DMI indications.  The system sends DMI indications
to the DMI service-layer program.  The DMI service layer forwards the indications
to DMI management application programs. One of these applications, the DMI
Subagent, is a SystemView program that converts the DMI indications into
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) traps.  After conversion, the
system sends the traps to an SNMP manager program that resides on a remote
system.  The SNMP manager receives the traps and displays error log fields
so that a network administrator can read the traps to determine appropriate
action.
<P>
The current implementation translates a Unicode-format error log entry into
an ISO8859-1 format DMI indication.  The system changes any Unicode characters
that cannot be displayed in ISO8859-1 to a period (.).
