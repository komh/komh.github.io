<H1>Step 1 - Check the Error Log and Data Areas</H1><!-- entering slot 4 -->
<P>
The first places you should check when code failures occur are the Error
Log and associated data areas.  OS/2 Warp has a technology called FFST (pronounced
"fist"), which stands for First Failure Support Technology. A failure in
code that uses FFST technology collects useful problem analysis information
that is stored in the error log and in data areas. This can happen without
user or programmer intervention.  Error log data provides information such
as the date and time an error occurred.  This data also identifies the module
in which the error occurred, the severity, and description of the error.
 You can use data areas to store user-specified information (data structures,
for example) when code fails.  The system saves the data area with the error
log entry.  Many code problems can be pinpointed by analyzing what the error
log and data areas tell you.  A utility called SYSLOG controls error logging
and works with error log contents.
<P>
How does a programmer capture problem determination data?  FFST is the answer.
 FFST is a technique of capturing problem determination data at the time
of a code failure.  You use FFST by placing calls to the FFSTProbe API in
strategic places in your code.  Each time you call FFSTProbe for a problem,
the system writes an entry to the error log.  The system also writes entries
to data areas if you have coded the FFSTProbe API to do so.  The data in
the error log entry includes information that identifies the product that
encountered the problem.  The system stores product information in a database
that conforms to the Desktop Management Interface (DMI) standards.
<P>
FFSTProbe is a powerful function and requires some planning and setup. You
<B>instrument</B> your code by placing calls to FFSTProbe at specific points
in your code, along with your instructions for the function.  <A HREF="008_L1_GuidetoInstrumenting.html">Guide
to Instrumenting Your Code</A>, provides an introduction to using this API
and steps for planning and using it.
<P>
You may decide later that you want to override the calls to FFSTProbe. A
Probe Control Table, with a graphical utility, provides this function. Entries
in the Probe Control Table override the coded probe functions. This dynamic
override capability is very useful because it allows you to change what
the probes do without having to recode and recompile your programs.

<A HREF="008_L1_GuidetoInstrumenting.html">Guide to Instrumenting Your Code</A>,
provides detailed information about this first phase of problem analysis.
 It explains the data collected and provides guidance for planning and instrumenting
your code. <A HREF="094_L1_CapturingandSavingFa.html">Capturing and Saving
Failure-Related Information through Dumps</A>, provides more details about
how to use the PM Dump Facility dump formatter to view the FFST dump.  <A HREF="060_L1_ViewingandAnalyzingE.html">Viewing
and Analyzing Error Log Entries</A>, provides more details about the error
log table, what the error log table contains, and how you can work with
the log.
