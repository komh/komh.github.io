<H1>Defining Trace Information Format</H1><!-- entering slot 42 -->
<P>
You create the defined format for a major code by using TRCUST.  The system
formats trace entries to represent the actual major code by descriptive
text instead of just numbers.  In addition, the system can format data saved
by the trace entries instead of being displaying the data as hexadecimal
numbers.  The use of TRCUST is completely optional.
<P>
The trace source file (.TSF) contains lines that describe the format of
each major and minor code.  TRCUST uses the .TSF file to generate .TFF files
(trace format files).  TRCUST generates one .TFF file for each major code.
 The trace formatter program uses the .TFF files to determine how to format
the trace point entries being displayed.
