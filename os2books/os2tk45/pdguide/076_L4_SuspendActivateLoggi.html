<P>
The<B> Suspend/Activate Logging</B> choice causes the system to either activate
or suspend the logging of errors to the current log.  If logging is active
when you select this option, the system suspends logging.  When logging
is inactive, selecting this option reactivates logging.  After suspending
logging, you can delete the log file and reactivate logging.  The system
creates a new log file with the same name as the deleted file and resumes
logging to the new file.
<P>
The system writes a record entry to the current error log file for each
change in logging status.
