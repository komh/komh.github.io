<H1>About This Book</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
OS/2 Warp 4 consists of various products including OS/2 Warp Version 4,
BonusPak, IBM's OS/2 implementation of Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Java technology,
VoiceType for OS/2 Warp, and networking products.
<P>
This book provides programmers with guide and reference information for
collecting and managing problem determination data using OS/2 Warp Version
4.
<P>
This book first provides conceptual and introductory information about OS/2
Warp Version 4 First Failure Support Technology (FFST). This sophisticated
and powerful tool requires thoughtful planning and code instrumentation.
 These topics present planning, setup, and examples that are used for collecting
and managing problem determination data.
<P>
Separate sections are devoted to understanding the aids that are provided
for tracking, collecting, storing, and formatting problem determination
data, such as traces, dumps, and error logs.
<P>
After reading this book you should understand the benefits of FFST and know
how to instrument your code.  This allows you to take advantage of the technology
and tools that are associated with problem determination data.  You should
also know how to use the APIs, trace, error logging, and dump functions.
 These functions retrieve, format, and analyze problem determination data.

<P>
This book assumes that you have the IBM Developers Toolkit for OS/2 Warp
Version 4 installed and you are developing application programs. In the
chapters of this book refer to the IBM Developers Toolkit simply as the
Toolkit.
