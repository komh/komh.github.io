<P>
You can also use a macro to call the FFSTProbe function; however, this is
not recommended.  When you use a macro, the macro gets expanded into working
code when you compile your code.  Using a macro causes your components to
increase in size.  Macros could have a dramatic effect on the size your
product if your code has numerous calls to FFSTProbe.
