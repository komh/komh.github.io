<H1>Setting Up for a Process Dump</H1><!-- entering slot 109 -->
<P>
The DUMPPROCESS statement in the CONFIG.SYS file on your system allows you
to activate the process dump facility. When a process dump file is created
the file name takes the form of PDUMP.nnn where nnn is an index that is
incremented each time a new process dump is created.
<P>
The syntax of the DUMPPROCESS statement in the CONFIG.SYS file is defined
below.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
DUMPPROCESS=x<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
x<!-- lm: 0x11 11 -->
<UL> This parameter specifies the drive letter (excluding
the colon) on system where the process dump data file is stored.  The file
takes the name PDUMP.nnn and resides in the root directory of the drive
specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
