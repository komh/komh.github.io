<H1>Event Notification</H1><!-- entering slot 87 -->
<P>
Each time your code calls the FFSTProbe function, the system creates an
error log entry.  This action is known as an<I> event</I>.  You can request
to be notified when the system records errors.  The system notifies you
through a process that is known as<I> event notification</I>.
<P>
You use an event-notification filter, a flexible data structure, to specify
the type of events for notification.
<P>
The functions that are associated with event notification are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->LogOpenEventNotification
<P>
This function enables your product to register with the logging service
so that the system notifies you when it creates specific records.  You specify
which log records you would like to be notified about by providing filtering
information.  If you do not provide filter information, the system notifies
you of every entry.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->LogChangeEventFilter
<P>
This function enables you to change the event-notification filter for a
registered product.  In addition to changing the filter, you can specify
current event-notification filter entries for the system to delete before
the filter change takes effect.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->LogWaitEvent
<P>
After the LogOpenEventNotification function registers your product with
the logging service, use the LogWaitEvent function to request notification.
 The system notifies you of the next error log entry that meets the registration
values.  The system returns the log entry into a buffer area your product
specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->LogCloseEventNotification
<P>
This function enables you to close event-notification requests and remove
product registration with the logging service.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
