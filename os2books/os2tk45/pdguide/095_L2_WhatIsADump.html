<H1>What Is A Dump?</H1><!-- entering slot 101 -->
<P>
A dump is a file created by the system at the time of a failure that contains
a collection of system data.  The collected data is analyzed by software
service personnel to determine the cause of a software problem. There are
three types of dumps possible for OS/2 Warp Version 4.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
The system generates a FFST dump when the FFSTProbe function requests certain
user and process data.  The dump collects the application-oriented and program-specific
information that you specify. <A HREF="008_L1_GuidetoInstrumenting.html">Guide
to Instrumenting Your Code</A> covers the FFSTProbe function, the FFST dump
function, and code instrumentation for this type of activity.  This chapter
contains information about formatting and displaying the contents of the
FFST dump.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Process dump
<P>
A process dump contains limited information about a single process that
was running at the time of the failure.  The system dump contains greater
detail about all processes that were running when the failure occurred.
 The process dump can be formatted using the PM Dump Facility dump formatter
described in this chapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

A system dump covers system-wide activities.  When a system dump occurs,
the system automatically stops and stores the contents of main memory.  After
the data is stored, the system automatically reboots and any operating data
that is not in main memory is lost.  In other words, when the operating
system software encounters a serious problem, the system triggers a system
dump.  The dump contains the important failure-related information held
in the system main memory.  The system records this information in a system
dump file.  You use the information to debug and solve system problems.
 This chapter discusses the system dump file later.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
