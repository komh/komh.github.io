<P>
Set up and triggering for FFST dumps are different than set up and triggering
for system dumps.
<P>
The system creates FFST dumps when the FFSTProbe function requests user
data, process environment data, or process status data.  Running a FFSTProbe
always causes an entry to be made in the system-error log.  A FFST dump
does not shut the system down.
<P>
A process dump contains limited information about a single process that
was running at the time of the failure.
<P>
The system creates system dumps when encountering a serious problem or error.
 When the system creates a system dump, the contents of main memory is stored
in the system dump file and the system shuts down.
<P>
Use the PM Dump Facility dump formatter to format, display, and analyze
FFST dumps, process dumps, and system dumps.
