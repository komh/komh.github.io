<H1>Enabling Manageable Products for DMI</H1><!-- entering slot 138 -->
<P>
The product manufacturer needs to decide which attributes of the product
are manageable.  To enable a product for DMI you write a MIF file that contains
descriptions of these manageable attributes.  Group the attributes logically
so you can write instrumentation code to provide attribute data.
<P>
Use the<I> SystemView Agent Programmer's Guide</I> in the Toolkit in the
Problem Determination Tools folder as a reference for enabling products.
This book defines requirements for products that communicate with the Service
Layer.  To develop such a product:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

Layer and the supported commands.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

of your product. Look for existing MIF groups that may apply to your product.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Begin with the ComponentID group and define MIF
groups that are based on the features of your product.  Use as many of the
existing standard groups that apply to your product as is possible.  Standard
groups are available from the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF).  If
needed, add proprietary groups for unique features of the product.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

or write-only, and define MIF attributes for each group.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

the direct interface to provide component information to the Service Layer.
Write your instrumentation code accordingly.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Decide which errors, exceptions, or problems
are to be sent to the Service Layer as indications and the attribute information
to include. Real-time, intelligent product management is made possible by
using indications because the system immediately notifies management applications
when a problem occurs.  Add code to your product to send these indications
to the Service Layer.  The system uses the DmiIndicate command block to
pass events to the Service Layer.  See the<I> SystemView Agent Programmer's
Guide</I> in the Problem Determination Tools folder on the system for information
about the DmiIndicate command block.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
