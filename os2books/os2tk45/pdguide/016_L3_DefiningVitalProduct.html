<H1>Defining Vital Product Data (VPD)</H1><!-- entering slot 16 -->
<P>
The DMI facility provides a standard way to register the hardware and software
on the system.  This allows both system software and system-based software
(for example, application programs or device drivers) to register with the
system.  This information is called Vital Product Data (VPD).  The system
uses VPD to identify the source of error log entries.  Various system management
applications require access to the VPD information.  When a product component
uses FFSTProbe to log an error, the error logging function automatically
includes the VPD information in the error record.
<P>
The VPD information allows systems management applications to assume a base
level of VPD for all conforming products on a system.  The VPD information
for software products differs from the VPD information for hardware products.
 You can define additional specialized VPD information for your product.

<P>
Both your component's install object (that the feature installer uses to
install your product) and the FFSTProbe parameter information must have
identical information.  This enables DMI to provide the template file that
is specified on the call to FFSTProbe.  Recommendations for these values
are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Vendor - a description of the organization or company
that developed the product that is reporting an error (example: IBM).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Tag  - a unique description of the product that is
reporting an error (example: FFSTProbe SAMPLE).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Revision - optional description of the development
organization's revision level, change level, or version of the product that
is reporting an error.  (example: 1.0.1c).  If a component within a product
is reporting the error, the revision may not correspond to the revision
level of the entire product.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Programmers refer to the Vendor, Tag, and Revision values as the<I> DMI
triplet</I>.
<P>
When your code calls FFSTProbe, the DMI triplet values you specified must
match the DMI values stored in the DMI database for your product. If the
values do not match, FFSTProbe cannot find the VPD for your product in the
DMI database.
<P>
If the DMI triplet for your product matches the DMI triplet of a different
product, the results are unpredictable.
