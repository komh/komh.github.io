<H1>Error Types to Consider</H1><!-- entering slot 21 -->
<P>
When an error occurs, call the FFSTProbe function to log the error.  The
following examples describe several error types you should consider when
you instrument your code and the types of data to capture for the error:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Error return<!-- lm: 0x11 9 -->
<UL> Determine the severity of an error
so that you call the FFSTProbe function only when the error return indicates
a serious problem.  When a calling program has a significant failure that
causes an error return, the program calls FFSTProbe.  Be careful not to
cause a "cascade" of calls to FFSTProbe as the system passes error returns
back up through a set of higher level function calls.
<P>
Failure-related data may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Return code<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Input parameters to the function<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Returned values from the function<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Any internal variables that determine or affect the
erroneous results<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Damaged data
structures<!-- lm: 0x11 9 -->
<UL> Product data structures can become damaged
with data that is not valid.  To capture data for this type of error during
normal processing, your code could have a method for periodically checking
important internal data structures.  Such logic is an important step toward
improving the reliability and availability of the product.
<P>
Failure-related data may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Data structures<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Historical information that indicates when your code
found the product data structure to be correct<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->General system data showing other programs in use
by the system when the error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Time-outs
and detected hangs<!-- lm: 0x11 9 -->
<UL> To detect time-outs and hangs,
design your code to sense how long a given request should take.
<P>
Failure-related data may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Current time-out values<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Any state information that describes what the timed-out
function is currently doing<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->States of resources that may relate to the time-out
or hang<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Historical information that describes what the timed-out
function had been doing before the error occurred.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Slow
performance of a service<!-- lm: 0x11 9 -->
<UL> In order to detect a slow
performance condition, design code to sense how long a given service should
take before calling FFSTProbe.
<P>
Failure-related data may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Internal resource states that may relate to the slow
performance of the service<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Historical information that indicates who has been
using that service and what requests the user made of the service.<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Traps
<!-- lm: 0x11 9 -->
<UL>It is difficult to detect a failure within a product
and determine its cause after an exception management routine has received
control. Well-designed and instrumented code can detect a failure before
exception management routines get control.
<P>
Failure-related data may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Exception blocks that contain the hardware state
when the trap occurred<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->Context data indicates what was being run when the
trap occurred (for example, call stacks or internal state variables)<!-- lm: 0x2 9 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
