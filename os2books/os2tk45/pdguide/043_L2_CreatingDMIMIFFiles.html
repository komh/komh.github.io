<P>
The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) Management Interface Format (MIF)
file is an ASCII text file that contains the attributes that describe manageable
products.  The MIF defines a standard way of providing the product information
to be retrieved by product management applications.
<P>
A manageable product provides information about itself in the form of attributes
in a MIF file that is stored in the MIF database.  There is a MIF file for
each manageable product on the system.
<P>
You use the attributes in the MIF file to describe components and characteristics
of your product.  Attributes can define the component version and revision
date, the date you installed the product, or the hardware requirements that
are needed to use your product.  Group the specific attributes together.
 In this example, the component version and the revision date would be one
group in the MIF file, and hardware requirements would be in a different
group.
<P>
Management applications retrieve the information in your MIF file.  You
use the management applications to list information about your specific
manageable product or all manageable products that are installed on a system.

<P>
The management applications, such as SystemView Agent or DMI Browser, contain
functions that can change the DMI information for a specific manageable
product.  You can change the DMI information of a manageable product without
reinstalling the product.  The product monitors its own DMI information
for any changes.  When changes occur, the product updates the functions
that it performs based on the new DMI information.
<P>
You can find the MIF file requirements in the<I> SystemView Agent Programmer's
Guide</I> in the Toolkit in the Problem Determination Tools folder.
<P>
There is an example MIF file in the Toolkit that you can copy as a base
for the MIF file for your product.  The file name is<B> PROBEMXP.MIF</B>.

<P>
For an example of a MIF file, see <A HREF="051_L3_MIFFileExample.html">MIF
File Example</A>.
