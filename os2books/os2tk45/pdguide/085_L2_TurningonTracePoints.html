<H1>Turning on Trace Points Using the TRACE Command</H1><!-- entering slot 91 -->
<P>
Use the TRACE command to control (turn on and off) trace points in your
product.  When you turn on a trace point, the system considers the trace
point to be active and stores information for trace point in the trace file.

<P>
Refer to<I> OS/2 Warp Version 4 Command Reference</I> for information about
using the TRACE command and its parameters.
<P>
The following two statements need to be added to your CONFIG.SYS file before
you use the TRACE command:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
TRACEBUF=x<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL><I> x</I> is used to set the trace buffer
size.  Valid values are from 1 to 63 kilobytes (KB).  The default size of
the buffer is 4 KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TRACE=ì ON | OFF ┘<!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Used
to turn trace on or off.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If neither statement (TRACEBUF nor TRACE) is included in the CONFIG.SYS
file on your system, trace is disabled.
