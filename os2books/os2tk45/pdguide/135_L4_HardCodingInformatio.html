<H1>Hard Coding Information into a MIF Database</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
The simplest way to make product information known through DMI is by hard
coding the information into the MIF database.  Using this method requires
no access code to be written, and DMI retrieves the product information
from the DMI database.
<P>
Hard-coded information has a major limitation: the system cannot dynamically
update the information yet maintain data integrity.  If you set an attribute
to read/write, anyone can update that value.  Another restriction of hard-coded
information is that you cannot add or delete rows in tables.  The only way
to update a read-only attribute is by deleting the old MIF file and installing
a new MIF file with the updated values.
