<P>
The information in this book describes First Failure Support Technology
and the supporting trace and dump facilities that are used during problem
analysis.  Note that trace utilities are not part of FFST.  The FFST technology
provides the tools (functions, commands, and graphical interface utilities)
to help you instrument and service your code to take advantage of this technology.

<P>
<A HREF="147_L1_SummaryofFunctionsan.html">Summary of Functions and Interfaces
</A>provides a summary of the functions, commands, utilities, and interfaces
that comprise FFST.
<P>
Although problem determination can be done, whether or not your code is
instrumented, any time taken to instrument code is well spent.  By instrumenting
your code, you will be able to take full advantage of the FFST, trace, and
dump tools if code problems occur.
