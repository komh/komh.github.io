<H1>Building and Sending an Indication</H1><!-- entering slot 89 -->
<P>
When the remote error reporting application receives an entry from the error
log, it translates the entry into a DMI indication.  An error log entry
contains multiple fields of information that describe the error being logged.
 The remote error reporting application translates several of the fields
into DMI attributes.  The attributes match the remote error-reporting System
Management Information Format (MIF) the system installed in the DMI MIF
database.
<P>
The DMI indication sends only a portion of the error log entry.  The indication
contains a total of 17 attributes from three error groups. The IBM Event
Indication group contains general attributes that identify the error.  The
FFST Error and OS/2 Software groups contain fields that provide specific
information.  For more detail of these error groups, view the remote error-reporting
MIF (REMOTERR.MIF).
<P>
Because the lengths of some attributes can be as long as 508 bytes.  The
indication, once converted into an SNMP trap, could exceed the maximum length
of 4096 bytes.  Normally indications do not exceed the maximum size.
<P>
The system sends DMI indications for Only error records with severity of
the following levels:  critical error, major error, and minor error.
<P>
