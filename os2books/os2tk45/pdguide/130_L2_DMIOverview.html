<P>
The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) provides the means for software and
hardware components to define VPD information. DMI also provides a standard
function set that management applications can use to access that information.

<P>
The DMI consists of four elements:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Format for describing information<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Format for data transfer<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Mechanism for data transfer<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set of services for facilitating communication<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You define component descriptions in a language that is called the Management
Information Format (MIF).  Each component has a MIF file that describes
the manageable characteristics of the component.
<P>
Component providers use the Component Interface (CI) to describe how to
access management information and enable a component to be managed.
<P>
Applications use the Management Interface (MI) to manage components.
<P>
The CI and MI are data interfaces, as opposed to procedural interfaces.

<P>
The Service Layer (SL) is an active, resident code that runs on the system.
 The SL mediates between the MI and the CI and performs services on behalf
of each.
<P>
The DMI is a local interface that is used within a single system.  DMI does
not replace existing network management protocols.  DMI provides a consistent
method for providing instrumentation to those protocols.  The Service Layer
is the broker of local instrumentation.
<P>
DMI provides the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Independence of a specific computer, operating system,
or management protocol<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An easily
adopted interface for application developers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Does not require a network<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Mapping to existing management protocols.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The DMI does not address or specify a protocol for management over a network.
