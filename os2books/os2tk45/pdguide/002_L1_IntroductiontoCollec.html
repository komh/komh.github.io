Ideally, programs run forever, error-free, and within their performance
targets.  However, code failures do occur.  When this happens, programmers
need problem analysis tools and techniques that help find problems as quickly
as possible.
<P>
OS/2 Warp Version 4 provides the architecture, tools, and support to help
you collect and manage problem determination data.  The goal is to get your
code back on track (that is,<B> service the code</B>) as quickly as possible.

<P>
This chapter introduces the problem analysis elements and techniques that
are available to you.  The remainder of the book provides details about
these elements.
