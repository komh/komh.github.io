<P>
<B>Instrumentation</B> is key to providing adequate code serviceability.
 If problems occur, instrumented code allows you or service personnel to
take full advantage of the FFST technology in OS/2 Warp Version 4.  The
system records problem determination data with no user or additional programmer
intervention.  Instrumentation decreases the need for reproducing user failures.
 System dumps and process dumps however do require intervention and problem
reproduction.
<P>
The captured information that is recorded in the error log is essential
to problem solving.  An error log entry contains information that indicates
the failing product, and the time the error occurred.  By analyzing the
captured information, you can determine the failing components, diagnose
the causes of the error, and correct the problems.
