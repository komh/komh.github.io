<H1>PM Dump Facility Dump Formatter File Option</H1><!-- entering slot 117 -->
<P>
The<B> File</B> pull-down menu offers the following options:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Open Dump File<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This option prompts you for the
dump file name to be analyzed. You can also open a dump file by dragging
it and dropping it onto the client window of the PM Dump Facility dump formatter.
 When you drop multiple copies of a dump onto the client window, the system
opens only the first copy.
<P>
When you analyze a system dump or process dump, a command line will be shown
at the bottom of the PM Dump Facility dump formatter display.  You can use
the formatter commands as a fast way to find specific data. Refer to the
<I>PMDF document</I> in the Troubleshooting folder for a list of system
dump and process dump commands.
<P>
When the dump file is first opened, only limited data will appear.  Use
the<B> Analyze</B> option to access the remaining dump data.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Log
Output<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This option prompts you to start or stop
logging output to a file.  Log data may be appended to an existing log file.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Save Output<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> This option
allows you to save all output displayed in the PMDF scrollable window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Decompress
Dump File<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> Select this option to decompress a new
dump.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For diskette dumps the DUMPDATA.nnn files may be copied for
a directory on the hard drive and decompressed from there.
<P>
PMDF has the ability to decompress diskette images created by OS2IMAGE without
re-creating the original diskettes. To use this facility each of the image
file must be named<I> image.nnn</I> where<I> nnn</I> is a numeric sequence
number that corresponds to the disk number.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Connect
<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL>Connect allows PMDF to be used as a terminal emulator
to drive a Kernel Debugger session.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Disconnect<!-- lm: 0x11 26 -->
<UL> Disconnect
terminated the communications session with the Kernel Debugger.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> Log Output...</B> option displays a window that allows the logging
of formatted dump data to a file.  When you turn on logging, the system
records all dump information formatted during this session in the log file
you specified.  The system also displays the formatted dump information
at the same time.  The system stores the data from the time that you started
logging until you close the PM Dump Facility dump formatter.  You also stop
logging by using the Log Output...  Stop push-button.  If you open another
dump file, logging continues.
<P>
When you select the<B> Save Output...</B> option, the system displays a
standard OS/2<B> Save As...</B> window.  Specify the file name for the saved
data.  The system will save all formatted dump output that was generated
since the file was opened or since the last<I> clear screen</I> was done.
 The system saves this "snap-shot" of dump data only when requested using
this option.  The system does not save the data simultaneously like it does
with the<B> Log Output...</B> option.
