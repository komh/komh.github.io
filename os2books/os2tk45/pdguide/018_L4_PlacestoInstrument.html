<H1>Places to Instrument</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->
<P>
The following list contains situations and places in your code you should
consider for instrumentation:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When your code generates an error return, create an
error log entry for the error condition that caused the error.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Some programmers use Print Debug and Print File for
testing code. These instructions print certain variables and messages at
various code failure points.  Convert the Print Debug and Print File instructions
to calls to the FFSTProbe API.  The system disables the Print Debug and
Print File functions after you install your code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When you expect return codes, create an error log
entry when you receive unexpected return codes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In environment situations (circumstances that are
not necessarily program errors but are worthy of creating an error log entry).
 For example, resource shortages, time-out conditions, system-hang conditions,
or lost physical connections.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In cleanup functions, your code may be tolerant of
potential errors and may do some error recovery.  The cleanup functions
in your code are candidates for logging if the recovery signifies an important
event.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Consider that the number of log entries and the size of entries you log
could cause too much information to be logged.  Creating excessive error
log entries can cause the error log to wrap.  This causes previously logged
information to be overwritten.  One of the most frequent questions that
are asked about FFST is where and when to use it.  When instrumenting your
product, you should consider several places:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Exception Paths
<P>
Many programmers already take some actions in various exception conditions.
 These actions often include cleaning up execution environments, closing
files, and ending the program.  Your code should call the FFSTProbe API
to create an error log entry that contains the following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->the program or module that failed<!-- lm: 0x2 8 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>why
the failure occurred<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL>-<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>what corrective actions to take.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Incorrect
Conditionals (for example, switch case)
<P>
As developers write programs, they make assumptions of what can or cannot
happen, and add various conditionals and execution blocks to programs.
<P>
Conditionals that are not valid are ideal candidates for a call to the FFSTProbe
API to log these failures.  By calling the FFSTProbe function at these points,
you can quickly and accurately pinpoint the failure and capture the associated
data at the time of failure.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>External
Calls
<P>
OS/2 Warp Version 4 does not expect calls to external programs to fail.
 However, unexpected return codes, when not handled, can result in program
failure.  Your code should call FFSTProbe after each external call that
results in an unexpected return code.
<P>
Some development groups use someone other than the developer instrument
all calls.  Other groups spend more time anticipating the potential problem
areas and placing probes only in those areas.  Your code should do what
is achievable for the current circumstances.  You should then evaluate how
well your calls to FFSTProbe work before you begin the next development
cycle.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For FFSTProbe API calls to be useful in debugging a problem, the calls must
specify:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A unique probe ID<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Descriptive
text<!-- entering slot 19 --> explaining the problem<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Data that is relevant to the failure<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Instructions on how to resolve the problem
if appropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
With well-instrumented code, several benefits of using the FFSTProbe function
are evident.  You can use FFST to capture error information. You can also
identify areas in your code that<B> did not</B> cause the problem.  If instrumented
code made no calls to FFSTProbe, you can focus on code without calls to
FFSTProbe.
<P>
Your code should not call the FFSTProbe function inside a loop.  Call FFSTProbe
only once per error situation.  Repeated calls may cause system performance
problems and cause wrapping of FFST data by storing unnecessary data.
<P>
Problem-prone components in products are good candidates for the FFSTProbe
function.
<P>
Your decision about using instrumentation depends on the possible errors
and the cost of solving an error.
