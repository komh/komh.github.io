<P>
Management applications use the DMI Get, Set, and List commands to request
information about manageable products on a local system.  Each management
application that manages system components must register with the Service
Layer to issue commands and to receive notifications of indications.
<P>
To register with the Service Layer, an application uses the DmiRegisterMgmtCmd
command.  To unregister, applications use the DmiUnregisterMgmtCmd command.
