<H1>Deciding What Data You Want to Collect</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
After you decide where to call the FFSTProbe function, you need to decide
what data to capture.  The question to ask is, "What data would I need to
see to have a good chance of determining the source of the error?"  Consider
capturing data items that are global variables and control blocks.
<P>
Other things to consider are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->How much data you need to determine the cause of the
problem?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Has this problem been encountered before?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->How complex is the code?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Are other components or products being called?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Does the error message information point to the problem?
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Make every effort to collect enough data to solve the problem without requiring
the user to re-create the problem.
<P>
The amount of data collected could also be affected by the amount of system
storage that is available or allocated to store error data.
