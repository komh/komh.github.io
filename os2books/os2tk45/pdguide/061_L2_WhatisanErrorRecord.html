<P>
An<I> error record</I> is created by the system when an error in a system
or application program triggers a probe in that program.  Error records
contain detailed information to help you diagnose the error. Error records
are also called<I> DET1</I> records.  Records created by a back level logging
system are called<I> DET4</I> records.
