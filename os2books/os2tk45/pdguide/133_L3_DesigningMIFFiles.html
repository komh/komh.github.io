<H1>Designing MIF Files</H1><!-- entering slot 139 -->
<P>
MIF files are the key to enabling your product to be managed by the desktop
system.  A well designed MIF file is important.
<P>
The DMI requires that the MIF file be an ASCII text file that contains the
groups and attributes that you defined for your product.  You must provide
all meaningful information by using the MIF file.  The text in the file
must follow the defined syntax and grammar.
<P>
After you decide which product attributes are manageable, define the attributes
into standard groups as much as possible in the MIF file.
<P>
The DMI Specification describes attribute characteristics and options. All
attributes must have these four items defined:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Name<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> The name of the attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ID
<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL>The unique, sequential attribute ID within the group
containing the attribute<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Type<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> The
attribute's data type.  The type is either a specific data type that DMI
supports or an enumerated list that provides flexibility in the attribute
definitions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Value<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> The actual
value (to be put into the database) or a pointer to the instrumentation
that gets the value<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition, you can optionally define description, access, and storage
attributes.
<P>
The description can be one or many lines.  The description text should be
as clear and informative as possible to provide management applications
with complete information about the attribute.  You need a good description
at the component level and group level.
<P>
The system uses an access statement to determine whether the attribute's
value is read-only, read-write, or write-only.
<P>
The storage statement provides a hint to management applications about whether
to assist in optimizing storage requirements.  Two options are available:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>common</I> - you use this option to signify that
the attribute value is typically limited to a small set of possibilities
that you can be optimize.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>specific
</I>- you use this option to signify that the attribute value is not a good
candidate for optimization because of the possibility of a large number
of different values.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You can find the MIF file requirements in the<I> SystemView Agent Programmer's
Guide</I> in the Toolkit in the Problem Determination Tools folder.
