<H1>Creating a Trace File Entry Using the TraceCreateEntry Function</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
Use the TraceCreateEntry function to create an entry in a trace file when
trace is being performed.
<P>
The TraceCreateEntry function uses a single parameter packet structure,
TCEREQUEST, that is defined in the<I> trace.h</I> file that is part of the
Toolkit.  Use the packet to specify the following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Major and minor codes<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An optional set of state-related data that is to be
logged within the trace entry that the trace point creates<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A parameter packet is a structure that contains values or parameters.
<P>
The TraceCreateEntry caller does not have to provide any logic to check
whether you turned on the trace point.  The TraceCreateEntry function performs
all necessary checking.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Some additional overhead exists when you use the TracecCreateEntry
function without checking the state of the trace first.  The trace service
automatically time-stamps all trace entries that TraceCreateEntry creates.

<P>

<P>
In the example that is described in <A HREF="046_L2_ExamplesofCodewhenIn.html">Examples
of Code when Instrumenting for FFST and Trace</A>, the code calls the TraceCreateEntry
function.  This example logs two data variables for the trace point.  The
first variable is a 32-bit status code. The second variable is a 16-bit
flag word:
<P>
An application program can add trace points to a program.  The program adds
trace points by using the TraceCreateEntry function.  Refer to <A HREF="148_L1_ProblemDetermination.html">Problem
Determination APIs</A> for information about the TraceCreateEntry function.
