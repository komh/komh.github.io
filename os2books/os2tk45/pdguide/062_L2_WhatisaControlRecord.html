<P>
A<I> control record</I> is created by the system when you make changes to
the way errors are logged.  For example, when you suspend error logging
or direct error logging to a new file, the system records that change in
a control record.  Control records are also called<I> DET2</I> records.
 Control records are new for FFST technology and are not available in records
created by a back level logging system.
