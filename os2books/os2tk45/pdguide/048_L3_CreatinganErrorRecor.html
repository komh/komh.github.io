<H1>Creating an Error Record Template Input File</H1><!-- entering slot 52 -->
<P>
You use a text editor to create an input file.  MKTMPF uses this file to
create error record template files.  There should be one set of default
path names and one or more sets of template entries for each use of MKTMPF.

<P>
The following example shows a template input text file to use with the MKTMPF
command for the procedure in the PROBE.C example.

Error Record Template Input File

<PRE>  Descriptive_Name         = 'System Management Example Template file'
  *
  * 'File name only' can be specified as long as the message files are on the
  * system's DPATH otherwise full path must be specified.
  * NOTE:  MESSAGE FILES WILL BE 6 CHAR file name with a .MSG Extension
  * Created by MKMSGF utility
  *
  * A single template file can contain entries for an entire product or a
  * single program *depending solely on the development teams preferences.
  * The only requirement is that all users of the template file use the
  *same DMI triplet or hardcode to the same path
  *
  Default_message_pathname = probe.msg
  Default_causes_pathname  = probe.msg
  Default_actions_pathname = probe.msg
  Default_details_pathname = probe.msg
  *
  * Template number is associated with the FFSTProbe call
  *
  Template_number          = 11111
  *
  * Message_number is the message number you want displayed on the SYSLOG
  * summary screen
  *
  Message_number           = 1
  *
  * Log_class 1 is hardware, 2 is software
  *
  Log_class                = 2
  *
  * Default_xxxxx_pathname can be overridden on a template entry basis
  * like this:
  * Causes_pathname          = c:\os2\system\othrCmsg.msg
  * Actions_pathname         = c:\os2\system\othrAmsg.msg
  * Details_pathname         = c:\os2\system\othrDmsg.msg
  *
  * On the right of the = sign you specify which message number you want
  * displayed in the relevant _causes _actions section of the SYSLOG
  * display. Here message 4 is displayed from PROBE.MSG in the
  * Fail_causes section of SYSLOG.
  *
  Fail_causes              = 4,0,0,0
  Fail_actions             = 0,0,0,0
  Install_causes           = 0,0,0,0
  Install_actions          = 0,0,0,0
  User_causes              = 0,0,0,0
  User_actions             = 0,0,0,0
  *
  Template_number          = 22222
  Message_number           = 2
  Log_class                = 2
  Fail_causes              = 4,0,0,0
  Fail_actions             = 0,0,0,0
  Install_causes           = 0,0,0,0
  Install_actions          = 0,0,0,0
  User_causes              = 5,0,0,0
  User_actions             = 6,0,0,0
  *
  * Detail data allows you to format the FFSTProbes log_user_data (if
  * used). You can use as many Detail data phrases as needed.  The
  * format is:  Detail_data = L,O,H,T where L is Length of data, O is the
  * Offset it starts at, T is the Type of data as it was sent and how you
  * want it formatted (e.g. binary show as hex) and H is the heading
  * message number you want to display with it.  When your run the example
  * you will notice the difference in formatting.
  *
  Detail_data              = 4,0,7,3
  Detail_data              = 4,4,9,2
