<P>
The<B> Redirect Logging</B> choice displays a standard file dialog for you
to choose a different destination for error logging.  You can select an
existing log file or a new log file.  If you direct logging to a log file
that does not exist, the system creates the file and directs logging to
the new file. The system writes an entry to the previously active error
log file to indicate the change in logging status.
