<H1>Format Process Dump</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
Selecting this option causes the PM Dump Facility dump formatter to start
another formatter session with the full path and name of the process dump
file.  This is similar to the way that the trace formatter is accessed.

<P>
The PM Dump Facility dump formatter then writes the following message in
the window:
<PRE>Formatting process dump file x:\xxxxxxxx.xxx
</PRE>

<P>
The x:\xxxxxxxx.xxx indicates the path name of the dump file.
<P>
If the system cannot find the process dump data file, a<I> File not found
</I>error message will be displayed.  Use<B> Open</B> option of the<B> File
</B>pull-down menu to specify the file name and path name of the dump file
to format.
<P>
If you close the PM Dump Facility FFST dump formatting window while the
process dump window is open, the process dump window also closes.
