<P>
Trace is a tool that you use for performance analysis and service level
debugging.  Use the trace tool after you perform development and debugging
at the individual module level or object level.  Microkernel, operating
system, and application programmers as well as service personnel can use
the trace facilities to assist in tracking code problems.  For more information
about using trace, refer to <A HREF="084_L1_AnalyzingPerformance.html">Analyzing
Performance and Debugging Problems Using Trace</A>.
