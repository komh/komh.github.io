<P>
The<B> Change Log Size</B> choice allows users to change the maximum size
of the log file that the system allocates.  You can either increase or decrease
the size of the log.  You cannot make the size smaller than the current
size.  Selecting this choice displays the path name of the system's current
log file as well as any other log files that are known to the system.  The
system also displays the current maximum size and an input field allowing
the maximum size to be changed.  When complete, a message box informs the
user of the new status.  This choice does not change the maximum size of
log files other than the selected log.  The system writes a log entry to
the error log file you specified to indicate the change in size.
