<P>
The Component Interface outline lists five procedures that define the simplest
method for you to write run-time instrumentation.  When you complete the
outline files, include them in the library and in your program.
<P>
To use run-time programs, use an instrument to specify the attribute value
of the MIF Path block name.  The block name should contain the run-time
program file name or path name.  (See the<I> SystemView Agent Programmer's
Guide</I> on the system for details about using the Path block in the MIF
file.) This program runs when the Service Layer needs to access the attribute
values.
<P>
If the file name in the path block does not have a complete path, the Service
Layer uses the library path to find the DLL.
