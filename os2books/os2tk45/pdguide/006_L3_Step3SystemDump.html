<H1>Step 3 - System Dump</H1><!-- entering slot 6 -->
<P>
If steps 1 and 2 do not help you determine the cause of a code failure,
step 3, system dump, is the recommended final step.  This is the primary
tool used by service personnel to solve system code problems and application
code problems.  Use a debugger for application problems. OS/2 Warp Version
4 has the technology to initiate a system dump when code fails. The dump
information that is stored on disk provides information about the reasons
for the code failure.  Use this step as a final step because your system
will restart after it stores the dump.
<P>
This third step of problem analysis has three phases:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Configure: involves adding the TRAPDUMP statement
to the CONFIG.SYS file, selecting the<I> Enable System Dump</I> choice on
the Probe Control Table, and allocating disk space by using a disk partition
for storing the system dump.  System dumps can be stored on diskettes but
the number of diskettes required will depend on the amount of main storage
memory your system has.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
