<P>
OS/2 Warp Version 4 applications can be instrumented for trace by adding
calls to the TraceCreateEntry function to collect user-specified data.  When
running the program, the system collects specified data and stores the data
in a trace file.  Use the trace format (TRACEFMT) command discussed <A HREF="084_L1_AnalyzingPerformance.html">Analyzing
Performance and Debugging Problems Using Trace</A> to view and analyze the
data stored in the trace file.
<P>
Using trace points is one of the best ways to collect serviceability information
on a customer system.  It allows service personnel and developers to follow
the course of events that lead to the failure.
