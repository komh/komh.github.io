<P>
Component instrumentation sends unsolicited messages, to the Service Layer
to signal some particular situation.  The messages are known as<I> events</I>.
When the messages reach a management application, they are known as<I> indications</I>.
The indication ID identifies indications.  The IDs start at the number 1.
 Events are often a sign of a catastrophic occurrence or other activity
that the system should know about immediately.  The event identification
is specific to a given component and appears as an unsolicited "get."  You
specify event structures as groups in the component's MIF file.
<P>
In DMI, all commands are specified by using data blocks.  Component instrumentation
uses the function call DmiIndicate() to send the indication block and any
following blocks to the Service Layer for processing.  The C language prototype
call is as follows:
<PRE>unsigned long  DmiIndicate(PTR command)
</PRE>
where command is the complete command block.  The system returns a 32-bit
status value to indicate success or failure.
<P>
The Service Layer immediately returns control to the component instrumentation
while it processes the indication.  The component instrumentation is free
to issue additional indications, but it cannot reuse the original indication
block buffer until the Service Layer processing is complete.  Simultaneous
indications from a component instrumentation must use different indication
blocks.  When the Service Layer has completed processing the indication,
it calls the function pResponseFunc() identified in the original indication
block.  At that point, the component instrumentation can reuse the block.
