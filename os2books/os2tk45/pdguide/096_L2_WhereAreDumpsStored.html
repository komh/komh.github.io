<H1>Where Are Dumps Stored?</H1><!-- entering slot 102 -->
<P>
FFST dumps are stored stored in the directory specified in the FFST setup.
 If you do not specify where to store FFST dumps, the system will store
the FFST dump file in the default directory of &lt;boot-drive&gt;\OS2\SYSTEM\RAS.
The FFST dump file will have the extention of<I> DMP</I>.
<P>
Process dumps can be stored only in the root directory of the drive specified
in the DUMPPROCESS statement in the CONFIG.SYS file (see <A HREF="103_L3_SettingUpforaProcess.html">Setting
Up for a Process Dump</A>). The file name will be<I> PDUMP.nnn</I> where
<I>nnn</I> is a number that is incremented each time a process dump is generated.

<P>
System dumps are stored either in a dedicated FAT hard disk partition on
your system or on a diskette.  For details on setting up the dump partition
refer to <A HREF="098_L3_SettingUpforaSystemD.html">Setting Up for a System
Dump</A> for more information.
<P>
System dumps taken to a hard disk partition may be used directly by the
PM Dump Facility dump formatter.
<P>
Any system dump stored on diskettes is compressed and needs to be decompressed
to produce a single dump file. This may be done directly from PMDF by selecting
the<B> Decompress Dump</B> option of the File pull-down.  PMDF offers the
additional facility of decompressing diskette dumps directly from diskette
images (see <A HREF="111_L4_PMDumpFacilityDumpFo.html">PM Dump Facility
Dump Formatter File Option</A>).
