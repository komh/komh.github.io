<H1>OpenGL Windowing and Input Toolkits</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
OpenGL on OS/2 is supplied with two toolkits (AUX and GLUT) that provide
simple windowing and input handling. These toolkits are not intended for
application development, but rather for uninhibited experimentation with
3D functionality. The GLUT toolkit has more features than AUX, including
popup menus.
<P>
Toolkits are provided "as-is" on most OpenGL platforms, including OS/2.
They are also used in sample code provided in the<I> OpenGL Programming
Guide</I> published by Addison-Wesley (see <A HREF="006_L2_SourcesforOpenGLInfo.html">Sources
for OpenGL Information</A>).
