<P>
This function replaces the old current context (if there was one) with the
new context specified by<I> hgc</I>. Before unbinding the old context, an
implicit flush of the old context takes place. Subsequent OpenGL rendering
calls use<I> hgc</I> to modify<I> hwnd</I>.
<P>
The first time<I> hgc</I> is made current to a window, its viewport is initialized
to the full size of<I> hwnd</I>. Subsequent calls to pglMakeCurrent with
<I>hgc</I> do not affect its viewport.
<P>
To unbind the current context without binding a new context, issue the call
pglMakeCurrent(hab,NULL,None).
<P>
For an OpenGL context to be bound to a PM window, the window should be created
with window client class CS_SIZEREDRAW and CS_MOVENOTIFY. During the time
the context is bound to the window, the application cannot subclass the
window with WinSubclassWindow.
