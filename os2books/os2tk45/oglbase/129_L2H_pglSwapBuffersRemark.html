<H1>pglSwapBuffers - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
When a window's buffers are swapped, the back buffer becomes the front,
and the front buffer becomes the back. An implicit glFlush is done by pglSwapBuffers
before it returns. OpenGL commands issued after calling pglSwapBuffers are
not issued until the buffer swap is complete. This function has no effect
on windows attached to single-buffered contexts.
<P>
The programmer can control which buffer is affected by OpenGL rendering
calls through the use of glDrawBuffer. Front and back buffers are not created
for a window until it has been bound to an OpenGL context. The window specified
by<I> hwnd</I> does not have to be<I> currently</I> bound to an OpenGL context;
it needs only to have been bound at some point. This function has no effect
on a PM window that has never been bound to an OpenGL context.
<P>
