<H1>Introduction to OpenGL on OS/2</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
OpenGL is a highly precise, 3D rendering interface that is used in a wide
variety of applications, including CAD, entertainment, industrial design
and modeling, biochemistry, and scientific visualization. Functions of this
powerful interface include real-time 3D rendering of points, lines, and
polygons, support for lighting, texture mapping, anti-aliasing, fogging,
motion blur, hidden surface removal, transparency, and double-buffering
of images.
<P>
The OpenGL Architectural Review Board (ARB), of which IBM is a founding
member, defines the rendering functions for the OpenGL specification. To
implement support for OpenGL, a platform must provide a windowing and input
interface for the rendering functions. The implementation must pass conformance
tests defined by the ARB before the platform can legally use the OpenGL
trademark. This requirement ensures the portability of OpenGL from one platform
to another. The current OS/2 implementation of OpenGL conforms to the OpenGL
1.0 specification, and passes OpenGL 1.0 conformance tests.
<P>
OpenGL is intended to be an interface to graphics hardware. This means that
application writers do not have to code for a particular piece of graphics
hardware because they are ensured of consistent behavior across all graphics
hardware that passes the OpenGL conformance tests.
<P>
OpenGL does not need special 3D hardware to run on OS/2. Every OS/2 platform
contains a complete OpenGL pipeline and rasterizer implemented in software.
This implementation enables developers to provide entry-level 3D graphics
functionality to a broad base of users. OpenGL performance on OS/2 scales
with processor power. Higher floating-point power yields better OpenGL performance.
