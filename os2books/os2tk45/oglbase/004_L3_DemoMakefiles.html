<P>
Makefiles are included only for the IBM C Set and Visual Age compilers,
not for all the compilers supported by OS/2. Compiler and linker flags are
explained in the C Set makefile. Link statements are also provided for VACPP.
If you are using VACPP, set VACPP=1 in your OS/2 environment before you
compile.
<P>
Be sure to read the explanations in the Makefiles for the switches we use
with the IBM C Set compiler. You will want to compile and link your demos
with case exact turned on, meaning you want the compiler/linker to call
glVertex3fv, not GLVERTEX3FV. Be sure to specify a large stack-if you look
at our .def files (another C Set-ism), we are specifying a 1 MB stack for
small demos. Currently to run Viewperf, the official OpenGL benchmark, we
specify a STACKSIZE of 4 MB. You won't get a STACKSIZE this big unless you
specify it. The OpenGL entry points pass the parameters on the stack, so
your calling sample should do this (as opposed to passing in registers).
Read through the C Set compiler/linker parameters as described in the makefiles.
