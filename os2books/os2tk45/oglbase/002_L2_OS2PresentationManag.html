<H1>OS/2 Presentation Manager GL (PGL) Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 2 -->
<P>
A small set of functions integrates OpenGL with whatever windowing system
is currently running. Because these functions are windowing-system specific,
they cannot be the same across all platforms. In OS/2 these functions comprise
the PGL (Presentation Manager GL) specification. Application programmers
use the PGL interface to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create and prepare an OpenGL context for rendering
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Swap a window's front and back buffers (front buffer
is displayed)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select a color palette for a color index context<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Integrate GPI and OpenGL rendering and fonts<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
PGL provides much of the same functionality as glX in X Windows systems,
and the WGL interface in Microsoft systems. This implementation of OpenGL
works on OS/2 Warp.
<P>
OpenGL contexts are created using <A HREF="028_L2_pglCreateContext.html">pglCreateContext</A>.
A parameter to this function is a <A HREF="162_L2_VISUALCONFIG.html">VISUALCONFIG</A>,
a pointer to a visual configuration data structure that describes the type
of ancillary buffers required for the rendering context. A list of available
VISUALCONFIGs can be queried with pglQueryConfigs. When choosing a <A HREF="162_L2_VISUALCONFIG.html">VISUALCONFIG</A>,
select the one that contains only the buffers that you need. For instance,
choose a VISUALCONFIG with accumulation buffers only if you plan to use
them. Accumulation buffers are 64 bits deep, and allocating memory for a
400 x 400 window would consume 1,280,000 bytes.
<P>
When an OpenGL context is created, it can be specified as either a direct
context or an indirect context:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A direct context bypasses the Presentation Manager
when displaying OpenGL images and is generally faster than an indirect context.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An indirect context uses a standard Presentation Manager
bitmap to display images and allows the integration of OpenGL and GPI rendering
function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After a context is created, it must be bound to an OS/2 window by calling
<A HREF="082_L2_pglMakeCurrent.html">pglMakeCurrent</A> When a context is
current, that means it can finally be used for rendering.
<P>
OpenGL runs as a set of DLLs on top of OS/2:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->OPENGL.DLL contains all rendering entry points, glu
entry points, PGL entry points, and the OpenGL pipeline code. The pipeline
code is responsible for object transformation, lighting, culling and clipping.
Applications only need to link with OPENGL.DLL to use the OpenGL API.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->RASTER.DLL contains a rasterizer, which takes vertices
and creates fragments. These fragments then go through a series of possible
steps including texture mapping, fogging, depth tests (Z-buffering), blending
and many more.  Some or all of these steps can be performed by 3D hardware,
if available. (Using <A HREF="123_L2_pglSwapBuffers.html">pglSwapBuffers
</A>will flush and display the rendered image.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
