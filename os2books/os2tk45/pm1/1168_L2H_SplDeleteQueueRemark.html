<P>
If there are print jobs in the queue, SplDeleteQueue marks the queue PRQ3_PENDING.
No further jobs can then be added to the queue, which is deleted when all
jobs are printed. A queue marked PRQ3_PENDING can be held, and jobs in the
queue can be held, restarted, and repeated.
<P>
If a queue is held and there are jobs on the queue, a SplDeleteQueue function
fails with NERR_QInvalidState (2163).
<P>
To delete a queue on a remote server requires administrator privilege on
the remote server.
