<P>
A device context is a means of writing to a particular device. Before using
GPI functions to cause output to be directed to the device context, the
GpiAssociate function call must be issued (or the GPIA_ASSOC option specified
on GpiCreatePS).
<P>
DevOpenDC cannot be used to open a device context for a screen window; use
<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C4 64 -->WinOpenWindowDC</A> instead.
<P>
The device context is owned by the process from which DevOpenDC is issued.
It cannot be accessed directly from any other process. If it still exists
when the process terminates, it is automatically deleted by the system.
When using a device context type of OD_METAFILE_NOQUERY the querying of
attributes is not allowed. To improve performance of this type of metafile
no error checking is performed to ensure that such API calls are not attempted.
Query calls are accepted but the results returned are undefined.
<P>
This function requires the existence of a message queue.
