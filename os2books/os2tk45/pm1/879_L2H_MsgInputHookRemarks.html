<P>
This hook is intended for simulated user input, and only mouse and keyboard
messages should be passed in. All other messages will be discarded. Mouse
and keyboard messages injected into this hook will have the same effect
as if they were generated by the mouse or keyboard device driver. The messages
are routed in the same manner as normal user input.
<P>
The<I> pfNoRecord</I> parameter defaults to TRUE, implying that messages
received from the MsgInputHook hook will not be recorded in the <A HREF="817_L2_JournalRecordHook.html">JournalRecordHook
</A>hook. Injected messages should not be recorded unless necessary.
<P>
When all messages have been passed in the application must remove the MsgInputHook
hook using<A><!-- external link: 1D DA C4 FC --> WinReleaseHook</A>.
