<P>
Any job can be released by a user with administrator privilege.
<P>
A job created locally can be released locally regardless of user privilege
level, but it can be released remotely only by a user with administrator
privilege.
<P>
A remote job can be released by a user without administrator privilege only
if the user identification of the person initiating the request is the same
as the user identification of the person who created the job.
