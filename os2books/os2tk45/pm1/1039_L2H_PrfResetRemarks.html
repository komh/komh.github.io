<P>
This function causes the workstation to use different profiles. When the
workstation is initialized, the names of the user and system profiles are
taken from the PROTSHELL statement specified in CONFIG.SYS. PrfReset allows
the profiles to be changed during operation of the workstation, for example
by a logon application controlling multiple consecutive users of the system.

<P>
After the PrfReset function completes, the system has a new set of preferences
(for example screen colors), a new start-up list, and new spooler parameters.

<P>
The PrfReset function broadcasts the<A><!-- external link: 1D 4B C7 FC --> PL_ALTERED
</A>message, which must be processed by all applications that read their
default settings from the user or system profiles.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This will only change the default system values in the ini
file. It is up to the applications to read the new default settings and
reset them to their new values.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
For example, consider logon applications. On receipt of a<A><!-- external link: 1D 4B C7 FC --> PL_ALTERED
</A>message, they should carry out the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Read the new color settings from the new profiles,
and set the new screen colors (and palettes) which should be refreshed.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Set the country information, for example the date
and time format, which is read from the new profiles.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Other preferences, for example, those that affect
the operations of the alarm and the mouse, should also update with the new
settings held in the new profiles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This function requires the existence of a message queue.
