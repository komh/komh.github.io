<H1>Hooks and Procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 732 -->
<P>
This section describes dialog procedures, window procedures, and hooks.
 It shows the input parameters and returns that the operating system expects
an application to use in application procedures and that can be called by
the operating system in response to certain events.
<P>
Procedures and hooks are application code that is called by the system in
response to certain events.
<P>
The names and parameter lists of functions are contained in header files
that are incorporated into the application when it is compiled.  Their addresses
are contained in .LIB files that are incorporated at link time.
<P>
The names of procedures and hooks are defined by the application, and their
parameter lists are defined by the system. Function prototypes for these
procedures and hooks are in PMWIN.H. The prototypes have sample names that
can be changed by the programmer before they are inserted into the application
source code.
<P>
The application passes the address of these procedures and hooks in the
following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Dialog procedures<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> During the WinLoadDlg, WinDlgBox,
WinFileDlg, or WinFontDlg function<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Window procedures
<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL>During the WinRegisterClass or WinSubclassWindow
functions<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Hooks<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> During the
WinSetHook function<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Thunks<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> During
the WinSetClassThunkProc or WinSetWindowThunkProc functions.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
