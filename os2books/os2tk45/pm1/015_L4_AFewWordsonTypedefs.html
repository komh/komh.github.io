<P>
The OS/2 header files can be used with either C or C++ compilers. If __cplusplus
has been defined, the header files will produce code that is compatible
with C++.  This is done since several of the typedefs have been changed
to support C++. For example, many items that are unsigned char in the "C
header files" are char when compiled with __cplusplus. For instance,
<PRE>
typedef unsigned char BYTE;

</PRE>
has changed to
<PRE>
typedef char BYTE;

</PRE>

<P>
The existing samples that are included in the IBM Developer's Toolkit for
OS/2 Warp Version 3 can be compiled with either C or C++.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Prior versions of the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp
Version 3 provided two sets of header files:  one set for use with C compilers,
another set for use with C++ compilers. The same set of header files are
now used by either compiler.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
