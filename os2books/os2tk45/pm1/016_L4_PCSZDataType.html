<H1>PCSZ Data Type</H1><!-- entering slot 18 -->
<P>
If a function takes as a parameter a string that is not changed by the function,
the string parameter can be declared as a "const" string, or a<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C8 FC --> PCSZ</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C8 38 -->PCSZ</A> is defined in the header
files as a "const" pointer to a NULL-delimited string.
<P>
The "const" means that the function will not change the contents of the
string. The use of the "const" keyword is not specific to C++, many C compilers
support it as well.  However, the use of<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C8 38 --> PCSZ
</A>allows for better optimization by the compiler and is more semantically
compatible with C++.
<P>
The<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C8 38 --> PCSZ</A> data type is defined
in addition to the<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C8 3A --> PSZ</A> data type.
 Existing code that calls functions that use<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C8 3A --> PSZ
</A>will continue to work correctly, though they may cause warning or error
messages when compiled.
<P>
