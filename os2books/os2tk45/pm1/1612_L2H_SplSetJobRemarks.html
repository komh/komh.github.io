<P>
The job priority is changed, if necessary, to the priority of the next job
after the new position. If the spooler is restarted, the order in which
jobs are put on the queue depends on the priority and age of the job. This
order may be different from the order following the SplSetJob call.
<P>
Users without administrator privilege can use SplSetJob only for jobs created
when the same user name was logged on. They can move jobs backwards only,
and cannot increase the job priority above the queue priority.
<P>
A job created locally has no associated user name, and any user can set
information locally for the job. Only an administrator can set information
for a job on a remote server.
