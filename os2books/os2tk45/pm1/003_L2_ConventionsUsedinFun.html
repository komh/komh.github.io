<H1>Conventions Used in Function Descriptions</H1><!-- entering slot 5 -->
<P>
The documentation of each function contains these sections:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Syntax</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> The function syntax describes the
C-language calling syntax of the function and gives a brief description.

<P>
<B>Programming Note </B>
<BR>
The functions in this book are spelled in mixed-case for readability but
are known to the system as uppercase character strings. For example, the
function "GPIBeginArea" is actually the external name "GPIBEGINAREA".
<P>
If you are using a compiler that generates a mixed-case external name, you
should code the functions in uppercase.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Parameters
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>Each parameter is listed with its C-language
data type, parameter type, and a brief description.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->All data types are written in uppercase to match
the header files. A data type of "Pxxxxxxx" implicitly defines a pointer
to the data type "xxxxxxx".
<P>
The term NULL applied to a parameter indicates the presence of the parameter,
with no value.
<P>
Refer to for a complete list of all data types and their descriptions.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->There are three parameter types:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
Input<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Specified by the programmer.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>Output<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Returned by the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
</UL>Input/Output<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Specified by the programmer and
modified by the function.<!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>A
brief description is provided with each parameter. Where appropriate, restrictions
are also included. In some cases, the parameter points to a structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Returns
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL>A list of possible return codes or errors (when
appropriate) is included in this section. Some functions do not have return
codes. Refer to for a list of error codes and their numerical values, and
for a list of error codes and their descriptions.
<P>
For some functions, this section includes a statement that the function
requires a message queue. This means that, before issuing a call,<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 AB --> WinCreateMsgQueue
</A>must be issued by the same thread. For other functions, no previous
<A><!-- external link: 1D 10 C4 AB -->WinCreateMsgQueue</A> is required,
and it is only necessary to issue<A><!-- external link: 1D 58 C4 AC --> WinInitialize
</A>from the same thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Remarks</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> This
section contains additional information about the function, when required.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Related Functions</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> This
list shows the functions (if any) that are related to the function being
described.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> Example Code</B><!-- lm: 0x11 6 -->
<UL> An
example of how the function can be used is shown in C language.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
