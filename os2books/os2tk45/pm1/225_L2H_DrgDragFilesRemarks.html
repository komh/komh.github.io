<H1>DrgDragFiles - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->
<P>
This function begins a direct manipulation operation for one or more files.
<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 24 -->DRAGINFO</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 25 --> DRAGITEM
</A>structures are allocated and initialized, and are then used as input
to <A HREF="197_L2_DrgDrag.html">DrgDrag</A>.  All of the post-drag conversation
required to complete the direct manipulation operation is handled by an
object window created by this function.
<P>
The caller should set<I> fSourceRender</I> to TRUE if it must perform the
file manipulation for any of these files.  When<I> fSourceRender</I> is
TRUE, the caller receives a<A><!-- external link: 1D D1 C5 FC --> DM_RENDERFILE
</A>message as the drag-object window receives a<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C5 FC --> DM_RENDER
</A>message. The caller should move or copy the file after receiving the
<A><!-- external link: 1D D1 C5 FC -->DM_RENDERFILE</A> message.  The caller
should then send a<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C5 FC --> DM_FILERENDERED
</A>message to the drag-object window, and the drag-object window should
send a<A><!-- external link: 1D D0 C5 FC --> DM_RENDERCOMPLETE</A> message
to the target.
<P>
When<I> pTypes</I> is NULL, the .TYPE EA is interrogated to determine the
type for each file in<I> pFiles</I>.  When<I> pTypes</I> is not NULL, the
size of the array is expected to be the same as the size of<I> pFiles</I>.
 When any individual pointer in the array is NULL, the .TYPE EA for the
corresponding file is read. When .TYPE EA does not exist for any file for
which it is needed, a type of DRT_UNKNOWN is used.
<P>
When<I> pTargets</I> is NULL, the target name for a file will be the same
as the source file name with the path information removed. If<I> pTargets
</I>is not NULL, the size of the array is expected to be the same as the
size of<I> pFiles</I>.  If any individual pointer in the array is NULL,
the target name for the corresponding file will match the source name minus
the path information.
<P>
The rendering mechanism and format for each file is:
<PRE>
&lt;DRM_OS2FILE,DRF_UNKNOWN&gt;.

</PRE>

<P>
When an error occurs during the move or copy, the caller is sent a<A><!-- external link: 1D C3 C5 FC --> DM_DRAGERROR
</A>message. The caller can take corrective action.
<P>
As the operation is complete for each file in the list, a<A><!-- external link: 1D C4 C5 FC --> DM_DRAGFILECOMPLETE
</A>message is sent to the caller of DrgDragFiles. The caller is thus notified
that resources can be freed for a particular file.
<P>
This function returns TRUE if the drag operation was initiated successfully
and FALSE if an error occurred.
