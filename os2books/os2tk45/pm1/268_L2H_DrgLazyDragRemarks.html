<H1>DrgLazyDrag - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 275 -->
<P>
Before initiating a lazy drag operation by calling DrgLazyDrag, the application
must allocate the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> structure
using <A HREF="150_L2_DrgAllocDraginfo.html">DrgAllocDraginfo</A>.
<P>
DrgLazyDrag is called when the direct-manipulation button is pressed while
holding down the lazy drag augmentation key, currently the ALT key. As the
pointer moves over a potential target, a<A><!-- external link: 1D C6 C5 FC --> DM_DRAGOVER
</A>message is sent to the target window. When the pointer moves from one
target window to another, a<A><!-- external link: 1D C5 C5 FC --> DM_DRAGLEAVE
</A>message is sent to the former target.
<P>
If the pointer is over a valid window target when the direct-manipulation
button is pressed and the lazy drag "end drag" augmentation key (Ctrl+Shift
to link, Ctrl to copy and Shift to move) is pressed, a<A><!-- external link: 1D C8 C5 FC --> DM_DROP
</A>message is sent to the target window. The source window posts a<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C5 FC --> DM_DROPNOTIFY
</A>message, informing the target window that a drop has occurred.
<P>
<I>param2</I> parameter of<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C5 FC --> DM_DROPNOTIFY
</A>message contains the handle of the target window that the drag set was
dropped on. If<I> param2</I> is zero, the drag set was not dropped; in other
words, the drag operation was canceled. The source window must check<I> pDraginfo
</I>to see if the target window is different from the source. If the source
and target are different, the source window must free<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO
</A>upon receipt of the<A><!-- external link: 1D CA C5 FC --> DM_DROPNOTIFY
</A>message. If the source and target window handles are the same, the target
must free the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> after completing
the post-drop conversation.
<P>
The caller can define a default operation for the objects represented by
the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> structure by modifying
its<I> usOperate</I> field. If<I> usOperate</I> is modified, the new value
is sent to the target as the operation when a NO_DEFAULT operation would
normally be sent. The caller must not modify any other part of the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure. The<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 53 --> DRAGITEM</A> structures
associated with the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> structure
must only be altered with <A HREF="477_L2_DrgSetDragitem.html">DrgSetDragitem
</A>or by using a pointer obtained from <A HREF="350_L2_DrgQueryDragitemPtr.html">DrgQueryDragitemPtr</A>.

<P>
A window receives a<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C5 FC --> WM_PICKUP</A> message
when the direct-manipulation button is pressed holding down the lazy drag
augmentation key. In response to this message, an application is responsible
for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Obtaining a<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO
</A>structure using <A HREF="150_L2_DrgAllocDraginfo.html">DrgAllocDraginfo
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initializing the<A><!-- external link: 1D E8 C7 53 --> DRAGITEM
</A>structures using <A HREF="477_L2_DrgSetDragitem.html">DrgSetDragitem</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Objects are added to the drag set whenever a<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C5 FC --> WM_PICKUP
</A>message is received. The first time that message is received, the application
must call DrgLazyDrag to begin the lazy drag operation. Each subsequent
<A><!-- external link: 1D AF C5 FC -->WM_PICKUP</A> message that is received
during the course of a lazy drag operation indicates that objects are to
be added to the drag set. If objects are currently being dragged, the application
must reallocate the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> structure
using <A HREF="432_L2_DrgReallocDragInfo.html">DrgReallocDragInfo</A>. <A HREF="432_L2_DrgReallocDragInfo.html">DrgReallocDragInfo
</A>frees the current<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> and
allocates a new one. The lazy drag operation can then continue by making
another call to DrgLazyDrag.
<P>
Objects can also be removed from the drag set during the course of a lazy
drag operation. It is the application's responsibility to define what action
initiates such a "putback" operation; for example, if a "pickup" operation
executed while the pointer is not over a valid object. It is the application's
responsibility to decide if a putback operation may apply to individual
objects within the drag set or the drag set as a whole. If the putback operation
is applied to the drag set as a whole, the result is the same as canceling
the drag. If the put-back operation is applied to individual objects within
the drag set, the application must free the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO
</A>and reallocate it to represent the new state of the drag set. If the
drag operation is to continue, the application must make another call to
DrgLazyDrag.
<P>
DrgLazyDrag returns as soon as it completes initialization for the drag.
The pointing device remains active during a lazy drag and can be used in
the same manner as if no drag operation were in progress. As soon as DrgLazyDrag
returns, the application can free its<A><!-- external link: 1D E6 C7 51 --> DRAGIMAGE
</A>array.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Because the lazy drag operation is nonmodal, the mouse pointer
may by used as if no drag operation were in progress.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
Once a standard drag operation is commenced by calling <A HREF="197_L2_DrgDrag.html">DrgDrag</A>,
the objects that comprise the drag set cannot be modified without canceling
the drag and restarting. The drag set can be modified during the course
of the drag operation. When the drag set is modified, the application must
reallocate the<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C7 52 --> DRAGINFO</A> structure
and make another call to DrgLazyDrag.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The mouse changes to an arrow with an attache case attached
to the lower right-hand corner when the lazy drag is in progress, rather
than a stack of<!-- entering slot 276 --> images shown during a standard
drag.
<P>
The<I> pdimg</I> and<I> cdimg</I> parameters were added for compatibility
with <A HREF="197_L2_DrgDrag.html">DrgDrag</A> only.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
