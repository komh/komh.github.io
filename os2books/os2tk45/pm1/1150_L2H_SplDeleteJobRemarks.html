<P>
It is possible to delete a job that is currently printing.
<P>
If the print queue on which the print job is submitted is pending deletion
(following a <A HREF="1162_L2_SplDeleteQueue.html">SplDeleteQueue</A> call),
and the print job is the last in the queue, this function has the additional
effect of deleting the queue.
<P>
A user with administrator privilege can delete any job.
<P>
A job created locally can be deleted locally regardless of user privilege
level, but can be deleted remotely only by an administrator.
<P>
A remote job can be deleted by a user without administrator privilege only
if the username of the person initiating the request is the same as the
username of the person who created the job.
