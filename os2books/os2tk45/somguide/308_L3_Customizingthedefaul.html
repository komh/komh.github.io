<H1>Customizing the default base proxy class</H1><!-- entering slot 352 -->
<P>
Continuing the example from the previous topic, imagine that an application
derives 100 subclasses from the "Foo" class. If the application wishes to
cache the "Foo::attribute_long" attribute in the proxies for all remote
Foo-based objects, the application could supply 100 user-supplied proxy
classes, developed in the manner described above. However, this would become
a very tedious and repetitive task!
<P>
Alternatively, it is possible to provide a customized base proxy class for
use in the dynamic generation of DSOM proxy classes. This allows an application
to provide a customized base proxy class, from which other dynamic DSOM
proxy classes can be derived. This is particularly useful in situations
where an application would like to enhance many or all dynamically generated
proxy classes with a common feature.
<P>
As described in the previous topic, proxy classes are derived from the<B> SOMDClientProxy
</B>class by default. It is the<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> class that overrides
<B>somDispatch</B> in order to forward method calls to remote objects.
<P>
The<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> class can be customized by deriving a subclass
in the usual way (being careful not to replace<B> somDispatch</B> or other
methods that are fundamental to implementing the proxy's behavior). To extend
the above example further, the application might define a base proxy class
called "MyClientProxy" that defines a long attribute called "attribute_long,"
which will be inherited by Foo-based proxy classes.
<P>
The SOM IDL modifier<B> baseproxyclass</B> can be used to specify which
base proxy class DSOM should use during dynamic proxy-class generation.
To continue the example, if the class "MyClientProxy" were used to construct
the proxy class for a class "XYZ," then the<B> baseproxyclass</B> modifier
would be specified s follows:
<PRE>// xyz.idl

#include &lt;somdtype.idl&gt;
#include &lt;foo.idl&gt;

interface XYZ : Foo
{
  ...
  implementation
  {
     ...
     baseproxyclass = MyClientProxy;
  };
};

</PRE>

<P>
It should be noted that:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Base proxy classes must be derived from<B> SOMDClientProxy.
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a class "XYZ" specifies a custom base-proxy class,
as in the above example, subclasses of "XYZ" do not  inherit the value of
the<B> baseproxyclass</B> modifier. If needed, the <B> baseproxyclass</B> modifier
must be specified explicitly in each class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
