<H1>The 'regimpl', 'pregimpl', 'wregimpl' registration utilities</H1><!-- entering slot 309 -->
<P>
Before an implementation (a server program and class libraries) can be used
by client applications, it must be registered with DSOM by running the implementation
registration utility,<B> regimpl</B> (on AIX),<B> pregimpl</B> (on OS/2)
or<B> wregimpl</B> (on Windows).  The<B>  regimpl</B>  utility can also
be executed from the DOS command line;  this facility is available primarily
for use in batch files. During execution of<B> regimpl, pregimpl,</B> or
<B>wregimpl,</B> DSOM updates it database to include the new server implementation
and the associated classes. This enables DSOM to find and, if necessary,
to activate the server so that clients can invoke methods on it.
<P>
Typically, DSOM users employ the generic SOM-object server program, described
below. A discussion on how to write a specific (non-generic) server program
is found in the earlier section, "Basic Server Programming."
