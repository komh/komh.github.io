<H1>Registration steps using 'pregimpl' or 'wregimpl'</H1><!-- entering slot 313 -->
<P>
The<B> pregimpl</B> utility is a Presentation Manager version of<B> regimpl,
</B>the DSOM implementation definition utility. Similarly, the<B> wregimpl
</B>utility is a Windows version of<B> regimpl.</B> The<B> pregimpl</B> and
<B>wregimpl</B> utilities offer all the functionality of<B> regimpl</B> except
its command-line arguments (described earlier in "Command line interface
to `regimpl'"). In addition, the<B> pregimpl</B> and<B> wregimpl</B> utilities
provide an intuitive GUI interface in place of<B> regimpl</B>'s text-based
interface. Before proceeding, you should first familiarize yourself with
the basic registration process described earlier in "Registration steps
using 'regimpl'".
<P>
Note: OS/2 or Windows users can execute the text-interface<B> regimpl</B> utility
by entering<B> "regimpl"</B> at a system prompt, as described in the previous
topic, "Command line interface to `regimpl'." This facility is available
primarily for use in batch files.
<P>
You can start the<B> pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl</B> utility conveniently
in either of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the<B> Register Impls</B> icon in the SOMobjects
icon group, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the Run option of the File menu.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
With<B> pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl</B>, you can view, add, change or delete
DSOM implementation definitions, as well as view add or delete implementation
class definitions. These basic functions are accessible from the main menu
in the initial window that displays when you start<B> pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl.
</B>Thus, the main menu offers the choices:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
File<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> Implementations<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Classes<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>To work with an implementation definition,</I></U>  first click Implementations
on the main menu (or press Alt-I). The pulldown menu that appears shows
the options:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
View<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> Add<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Change<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Delete<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>To add an implementation definition,</B> click Add  on the pulldown menu
(or press A). This will bring up the Add Implementations  dialog box, where
you can define or change fields as necessary. The "Alias" field is the only
blank field for which a setting is mandatory. For this, you should enter
a "shorthand" name for conveniently referencing the registered server implementation
while using<B> pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl;</B> for example:<B>  myServer
</B>
<P>
Except for the "Alias" setting, the remainder of the fields may be left
either blank or with the default settings that are provided (see "Registration
steps using 'regimpl'". for descriptions of the defaults). If you should
clear a field that originally contained a default, then when the implementation
is applied,<B> pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl</B> will still use the default
setting [Note: The implementation-ID ("Impl ID") field is also displayed.
This is not an editable field but is shown for information purposes.]
<P>
Once the definition is complete, click Apply  (or press Alt-A) to add the
definition. Click Discard  (or Alt-D) to discard a new definition. You can
select Exit (or Alt-X) at any time to exit the dialog box. (Message boxes
or confirmation windows typically appear after you make entries.)
<P>
To change an implementation definition,  click Change  from the Implementations
pulldown menu (or press C). In the Change Implementations  dialog box that
appears, you can select the desired implementation by scrolling though the
list box on the left and highlighting your choice. Each time an implementation
is highlighted, details of its definition will appear in the edit fields
on the right. You can change any of the fields except the implementation-ID.
Once the changes are made, click Apply  (or Alt-A) or Discard  (or Alt-D)
as desired. Click Exit  (or Alt-X) to exit the dialog box.
<P>
The View  and Delete  implementations functions work similarly to the Change
Implementations<!-- entering slot 314 --> function above. That is, you can
highlight a selection in the list box on the left, and details of its definition
will appear in the edit fields on the right. In the Delete Implementations
dialog box, click Delete Current Implementation  to delete a selected implementation
definition. For either function, click Exit  (or Alt-X) to exit the dialog
box.
<P>
<U><I>To work with class definitions,</I></U>  first click Classes from
the main menu (or press Alt-C). This produces a pulldown menu with the options:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
View<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> Add<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Delete<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To add classes, select Add  on the Classes pulldown menu (or press A) From
the resulting Add Classes  dialog box, you can select an implementation
by scrolling through the list box on the left and highlighting your choice.
When an implementation is selected, the classes associated with it will
display in the list box on the right. To add a new class name to the highlighted
implementation, enter the name in the edit field at the bottom right, and
click Add Class (or press Alt-A). The new class name will then appear in
the list box on the right.
<P>
The current class name will not be cleared from the edit field, so that
more implementations may be selected, if appropriate, and the same class
can be added to them. Or, you can enter another new class name and add it
to the implementation as described above. Exit  (or Alt-X) may be selected
at any time to exit the dialog box.
<P>
To view classes,select View  from the Classes pulldown menu (or press V).
When you highlight an implementation in the list box on the left, the classes
associated with the implementation will be shown in the list box on the
right.
<P>
To switch key order, select the "Classes" radio button under "Display keyed
by". This causes all of the defined classes to appear in the list box on
the left. When you highlight a class name, all of the implementations associated
with that class will appear in the list box on the right. Exit  (or Alt-X)
may be selected at any time to exit the dialog box.
<P>
To delete classes,select Delete  from the Classes pulldown menu (or press
D). When you highlight an implementation in the list box on the left, the
classes associated with the implementation will be shown in the list box
on the right. You can then highlight a class and click Delete Class  (or
Alt-D) to delete the class from the highlighted implementation. A confirmation
window will appear next, which will also give you the option of deleting
the class from all  implementations. Exit  (or Alt-X) may be selected at
any time to exit the dialog box.
<P>
Important: Please note that any changes are saved internally in memory,
but are not  written to the database until you save the changes by clicking
File (or Alt-F) from the main menu and the n Save  (or S) from the resulting
pulldown menu. Conversely, you can abort all changes and reload the original
database by clicking File (Alt-F) and then Abort+Reload  (A). To exit the
<B>pregimpl</B> or<B> wregimpl</B> program, click File  (Alt-F) and then
Exit  (X).
