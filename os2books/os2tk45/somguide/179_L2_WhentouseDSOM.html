<H1>When to use DSOM</H1><!-- entering slot 215 -->
<P>
DSOM should be used for those applications that require sharing of objects
among multiple programs. The object actually exists in only one process
(this process is known as the object's server); the other processes (known
as clients) access the object through remote method invocations, made transparent
by DSOM.
<P>
DSOM should also be used for applications that require objects to be isolated
from the main program. This is usually done in cases where reliability is
a concern, either to protect the object from failures in other parts of
the application, or to protect the application from an object.
<P>
Some distributed applications may have special performance, reliability,or
cooperative processing requirements, to which the SOM Replication framework
is better suited. The Replication framework is oriented toward "groupware"
(multi-party cooperative processing) applications, and has facilities for
fault tolerance and recovery. The Replication framework is distinct from
DSOM in that it maintains a complete replica of an object in each participant's
address space, while DSOM establishes remote connections to shared objects.
The Replication Framework is available only in the full-capability SOM objects
Developer Toolkit.
