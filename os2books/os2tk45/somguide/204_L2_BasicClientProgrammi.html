<H1>Basic Client Programming</H1><!-- entering slot 241 -->
<P>
For the most part, client programming in DSOM is exactly the same as client
programming in SOM, since DSOM transparently hides the fact that an object
is remote when the client accesses the object.
<P>
However, a client application writer also needs to know how to create, locate,
use, save, and destroy remote objects. (This is not done using the usual
SOM bindings.) The DSOM run-time environment provides these services to
client programs primarily through the DSOM Object Manager. These run-time
services will be detailed in this section. Examples of how an application
developer uses these services are provided throughout the section.
