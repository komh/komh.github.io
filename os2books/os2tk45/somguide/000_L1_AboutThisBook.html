<H1>About This Book</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
This book accompanies the<B> SOMobjects Base Toolkit,</B> which consists
of the base (or core) capabilities in the<B> System Object Model (SOM) of
the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit</B>.  The base system is a rich subset
of the full-capability SOMobjects Developer Toolkit. Because the current
manual is a subset of chapters from the full<I>  SOMobjects Developer Toolkit
Users Guide,</I> references herein to the "SOMobjects Developer Toolkit"
should be interpreted as capabilities of the SOMobjects Base Toolkit.
<P>
This manual explains how programmers using C, C++, and other languages can:

technology,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Develop client programs that use class libraries that
were built using SOM, and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Develop applications that use the<I> frameworks</I> supplied
with the SOMobjects Toolkit, class libraries that facilitate development
of object-oriented applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
In addition to this book, refer to the<I> System Object Model Programming
Reference</I> during application development for specific information about
the classes, methods, functions, and macros supplied with the SOMobjects
Toolkit.
<P>
For purchasers of the full-capability SOMobjects systems, the<I> SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit: Emitter Framework Guide and Reference</I> contains documentation
of the Emitter Framework of the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit. In addition,
the<I> SOMobjects Developer Toolkit: Collection Classes Reference Manual
</I>describes the collection classes and methods provided with the SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit.
