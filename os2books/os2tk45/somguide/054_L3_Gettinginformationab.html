<H1>Getting information about a class</H1><!-- entering slot 71 -->
<P>
The following methods are used to obtain information about a class or to
locate a particular class object:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>somCheckVersion</B> <!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Checks a class for compatibility
with the specified major and minor version numbers. The receiver of the
method is the SOM class about which information is needed. Additional arguments
are values of the major and minor version numbers. The method returns TRUE
if the class is compatible, or FALSE otherwise.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somClassFromId
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Finds the class object of an existing class
when given its<B> somId</B>, but without loading the class. The receiver
of the method is the class manager (pointed to by the global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>).
The additional argument is the class's<B> somId</B>. The method returns
a pointer to the class (or NULL if the class does not exist).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somDescendedFrom
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Tests whether one class is derived from another.
The receiver of the method is the class to be tested, and the potential
ancestor class is the argument. The method returns TRUE if the relationships
exists, or FALSE otherwise.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somFindClass</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Finds
or creates the class object for a class, given the class's<B> somId</B> and
its major and minor version numbers. The receiver of the method is the class
manager (pointed to by the global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>). Additional
arguments are the class's<B> somId</B> and the major and minor version numbers.
The method returns a pointer to the class object, or NULL if the class could
not be created.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somFindClsInFile</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Finds
or creates the class object for a class. This method is similar to<B> somFindClass</B>,
except the user also provides the name of a file to be used for dynamic
loading, if needed. The receiver of the method is the class manager (pointed
to by the global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>). Additional arguments
are the class's<B> somId</B>, the major and minor version numbers, and the
file name. The method returns a pointer to the class object, or NULL if
the class could not be created.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetInstancePartSize
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the size of the instance variables introduced
by a class. The receiver of the method is the class object. The method returns
the amount of space, in bytes, needed for the instance variables.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetInstanceSize
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the total size requirements for an instance
of a class. The receiver of the method is the class object. The method returns
the amount of space, in bytes, required for the instance variables introduced
by the class itself and by all of its ancestor classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetName
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the name of a class. The receiver of
the method is the class object. The method returns the class name.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetNumMethods
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the number of methods available for
a class. The receiver of the method is the class object. The method returns
the total number of currently available methods (static or otherwise, including
inherited methods).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetNumStaticMethods</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Obtains
the number of static methods available for a class. (A static method is
one declared in the class's interface specification [.idl] file.) The receiver
of the method is the class object. The method returns the total number of
available static methods, including inherited ones.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetParents
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains a sequence of the parent (base) classes
of a specified class. The receiver of the method is the class object. The
method returns a pointer to a linked list of the parent (base) classes (unless
the receiver is<B> SOMObject</B>, for which it returns NULL).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetVersionNumbers
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the major and minor version numbers
of a class. The return type is void, and the two arguments are pointers
to locations in memory where the method can store the major and minor version
numbers (of type<B> long</B>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somSupportsMethod
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates whether instances of a given class
support a given method. The receiver of the<B> somSupportsMethod</B> method
is the class object. The argument is the<B> somId</B> for the method in
question. The<B> somSupportsMethod</B> method returns TRUE if the method
is supported, or FALSE otherwise.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
