<H1>DSOM Object Manager</H1><!-- entering slot 242 -->
<P>
DSOM defines a<I> DSOM Object Manager</I>, which provides services needed
by clients to create, find and use objects in the DSOM run-time environment.

<P>
The DSOM Object Manager is derived from an abstract, generic "object manager"
class, called<B> ObjectMgr</B>. This abstract<B> ObjectMgr</B> class defines
a basic set of methods that support object creation, location (with implicit
activation), and destruction.
<P>
As an abstract class,<B> ObjectMgr</B> defines only an interface; there
is no implementation associated with<B> ObjectMgr</B>. Consequently, an
application should<I> not</I> create instances of the<B> ObjectMgr</B> class.

<P>
 An abstract Object Manager class was defined under the expectation that
applications will often need simultaneous access to objects implemented
and controlled by a variety of object systems. Such object systems may include
other ORBs (in addition to DSOM), persistent object managers, object-oriented
databases, and so forth. It is likely that each object system will provide
the same sort of basic services for object creation, location, and activation,
but each using a different interface.
<P>
Thus, the<B> ObjectMgr</B> abstract class defines a simple and "universal"
interface that can be mapped to any object system. The application would
only have to understand a single, common<B> ObjectMgr</B> interface. Under
this scheme, specific object managers are defined by subclassing the<B> ObjectMgr
</B>class and overriding the<B> ObjectMgr</B> methods to map them into the
object system-specific programming interfaces.
<P>
DSOM's Object Manager,<B> SOMDObjectMgr</B>, is defined as a specific class
of<B> ObjectMgr</B>. It defines methods for:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finding servers that implement particular kinds of
objects<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Creating objects in servers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Obtaining object identifiers (string IDs)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finding objects, given their identifiers<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Releasing and destroying objects<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These functions will be discussed in the remainder of this section.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The OMG has standardized an "object lifecycle" service, which
includes support for creating and destroying distributed objects.  The DSOM
Object Manager may be augmented in the future with an OMG-compliant lifecycle
service.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
