<H1>Object Adapters</H1><!-- entering slot 335 -->
<P>
An Object Adapter (OA) provides the mechanisms that a server process uses
to interact with DSOM, and vice versa. That is, an Object Adapter is responsible
for server activation and deactivation, dispatching methods, activation
and deactivation of individual objects, and providing the interface for
authentication of the principal making a call.
<P>
DSOM defines a Basic Object Adapter<B> (BOA)</B> interface, described in
the CORBA specification, as an abstract class (a class having no implementation,
only an interface specification). The<B> BOA</B> interface represents generic
Object Adapter methods that a server written in an arbitrary language can
use to register itself and its objects with the ORB. Because it is an abstract
class having no implementation, however, the<B> BOA</B> class should not
be directly instantiated.
<P>
DSOM provides a SOM Object Adapter,<B> SOMOA,</B> derived from the<B> BOA
</B>interface, that uses SOM Compiler and run-time support to accomplish
dispatching of methods (that is, accepting messages, turning them into method
invocations, and routing the invocations to the target object in the server
process).<B> SOMOA</B> can be used to dispatch methods on either SOM or
non-SOM object implementations, as described in the sections "Implementing
Classes" and "Basic Server Programming." It is possible to use non-SOM based
implementations with<B> SOMOA,</B> and often there is no additional programming
required to use implementations (class libraries) already developed using
SOM.
<P>
The<B> SOMOA</B> works in conjunction with the application-defined server
object to map between objects and object references, and to dispatch methods
on objects. By partitioning out these mapping and dispatching functions
into the server object, the application can more easily customize them,
without having to build object adapter subclasses.
<P>
<B>SOMOA</B> introduces two methods that handle execution of requests received
by the server:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>execute_request_loop</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<B>execute_next_request</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Typically,<B> execute_request_loop</B> is used to receive and execute requests,
continuously, in the server's main thread. The<B> execute_next_request</B> method
allows a single request to be executed. Both methods have a non-blocking
option: when there are no messages pending, the method call will return
instead of wait.
<P>
On OS/2, if the server implementation has been registered as "multi-threaded"
(via an IMPLDEF_MULTI_THREAD flag in the<B> ImplementationDef), SOMOA</B> will
automatically run each request in a separate thread. If the "multi-thread"
flag is not set, the server implementation can still choose to manage its
own threads.
<P>
The generic server program provided by DSOM (described in the preceding
topic) uses<B> execute_request_loop</B> to receive and execute requests
on SOM objects.
