<H1>TypeCode constants</H1><!-- entering slot 379 -->
<P>
<B>TypeCode</B>s are actually available in two forms: In addition to the
<B>TypeCode</B> information provided by the methods of the Interface Repository,
<B>TypeCode</B> constants can be generated by the SOM Compiler in your C
or C++ usage bindings upon request. A<B> TypeCode</B> constant contains
the same information found in the corresponding IR<B> TypeCode</B>, but
has the advantage that it can be used as a literal in a C or C++ program
anywhere a normal<B> TypeCode</B> would be acceptable.
<P>
<B>TypeCode</B> constants have the form<B> TC_</B>&lt;<I> typename</I>&gt;,
where &lt;<I>typename</I>&gt; is the name of a type (that is, a typedef,
union, struct, or enum) that you have defined in an IDL source file. In
addition, all IDL basic types and certain types dictated by the OMG CORBA
standard come with pre-defined<B> TypeCode</B> constants (such as<B> TC_long</B>,
<B>TC_short</B>,<B> TC_char</B>, and so forth). A full list of the pre-defined
<B>TypeCode</B> constants can be found in the file "somtcnst.h". You must
explicitly include this file in your source program to use the pre-defined
<B>TypeCode</B> constants.
<P>
Since the generation of<B> TypeCode</B> constants can increase the time
required by the SOM Compiler to process your IDL files, you must explicitly
request the production of<B> TypeCode</B> constants if you need them. To
do so, use the  "tcconsts<B>"</B> modifier with the<B> -m</B> option of
the<B> sc</B> or<B> somc</B> command. For example, the command
<PRE>sc -sh -mtcconsts myclass.idl         (On AIX or Windows)
somc -sh -mtcconsts myclass.idl       (On Windows)
</PRE>

<P>
will cause the SOM Compiler to generate a "myclass.h" file that contains
<B>TypeCode</B> constants for the types defined in "myclass.idl".
