<H1>Exception declarations</H1><!-- entering slot 78 -->
<P>
As discussed in Chapter 4 in the section entitled "SOM Interface Definition
Language," a method may be declared to return zero or more<B> exceptions</B>.
IDL exceptions are implemented by simply passing back error information
after a method call, as opposed to the "catch/throw" model where an exception
is implemented by a long jump or signal. Associated with each type of exception
is a name, and optionally, a struct-like data structure for holding error
information. A method declares the types of exceptions it may return in
a<B> raises</B> expression.
<P>
Below is an example IDL declaration of a "BAD_FLAG" exception, which may
be "raised" by a"checkFlag" method, as part of a "MyObject" interface:
<PRE>   interface MyObject {<B>
      exception</B> BAD_FLAG { long ErrCode; char Reason[80];}

      void checkFlag(in unsigned long flag) <B>raises</B>(BAD_FLAG);
   };
</PRE>

<P>
An exception structure contains whatever information is necessary to help
the caller understand the nature of the error. The exception declaration
can be treated like a<B> struct</B> definition:  i.e., whatever you can
access in an IDL<B> struct</B>, you can access in an<B> exception</B> declaration.
Alternatively, the structure can be<I> empty</I>, whereby the exception
is just identified by its name.
<P>
The SOM Compiler will map the exception declaration in the above example
to the following C language constructs:
<PRE>   typedef struct BAD_FLAG {
      long ErrCode;
      char Reason[80];
   } BAD_FLAG;

   #define ex_BAD_FLAG "MyObject::BAD_FLAG"
</PRE>

<P>
When an exception is detected, the "checkFlag" method must call<B> SOMMalloc
</B>to allocate a "BAD_FLAG" structure, initialize it with the appropriate
error information, and make a call to<B> somSetException</B> (see "Setting
an exception value," below) to record the exception value in the<B> Environment
</B>structure passed in the method call. The caller, after invoking "checkFlag",
can check the<B> Environment</B> structure that was passed to the method
to see if there was an exception, and if so, extract the exception value
from the<B> Environment</B> (see "Getting an exception value," below.)
