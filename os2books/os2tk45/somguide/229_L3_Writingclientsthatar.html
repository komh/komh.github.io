<H1>Writing clients that are also servers</H1><!-- entering slot 266 -->
<P>
In many applications, processes may need to play both client and server
roles. That is, objects in the process may make requests of remote objects
on other servers, but may also implement and export objects, requiring that
it be able to respond to incoming requests. Details of how to write programs
in this peer-to-peer style are explained in section 6.9, "Advanced Topics".
