<H1>Role of DSOM generic server program</H1><!-- entering slot 296 -->
<P>
The generic server program provides basic server functionality: it continuously
receives and executes requests (via an invocation of the<B> SOMOA's execute_request_loop
</B>method), until the server is stopped. Some requests result in the creation
of SOM objects; the generic server program will find and load the DLL for
the object's class automatically, if it has not already been loaded.
<P>
When generic server program functionality is not sufficient for the particular
application, application-specific server programs can be developed. For
example, some applications may want to interact with a user or I/O device
between requests. The previous section, entitled "Basic Server Programming,"
discussed the steps involved in writing a server program.
