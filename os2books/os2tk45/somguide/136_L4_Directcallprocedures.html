<H1>Direct-call procedures</H1><!-- entering slot 166 -->
<P>
These are similar in concept to C++ static member functions. Direct-call
procedures are not given positions in SOM method tables, but are accessed
directly from a class's<B> ClassData</B> structure. Strictly speaking, none
of the previous method-resolution approaches apply for invoking a direct-call
procedure, although SOMobjects language bindings provide the same invocation
syntax for direct-call procedures as for static or nonstatic methods. Direct-call
procedures cannot be overridden, but they can be reintroduced. When SOMobjects
language bindings are used to implement a class, the SOM IDL<B> procedure
</B>modifier is used to indicate that a given method is a direct-call procedure.
Note: Methods having the<B> procedure</B> modifier cannot be invoked remotely
using DSOM.
