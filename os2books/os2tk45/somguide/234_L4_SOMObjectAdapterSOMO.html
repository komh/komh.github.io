<P>
The<I> SOM Object Adapter</I><B> (SOMOA)</B> is the main interface between
the server application and the DSOM run time. The<B> SOMOA</B> is responsible
for most of the server duties listed at the beginning of this section. In
particular, the<B> SOMOA</B> object handles all communications an interpretation
of inbound requests and outbound results. When clients send requests to
a server, the requests are received and processed by the<B> SOMOA.</B>
<P>
The<B> SOMOA</B> works together with the server object to create and resolve
DSOM references to local objects, and dispatch methods on objects.
<P>
There is one<B> SOMOA</B> object per server process. (The<B> SOMOA</B> class
is implemented as a<I> single instance</I> class.)
