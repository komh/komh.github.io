<H1>The 'somdReleaseResources' method and object-owned parameters</H1><!-- entering slot 265 -->
<P>
As stated earlier, the CORBA policy asserts that method parameters and return
results are uniformly caller-owned. This means the method caller has the
responsibility for freeing memory after invoking a method, regardless of
whether the memory was allocated by the caller or the object.
<P>
A class implementor can designate certain method parameters and results
as object-owned, however, by using the<B> object_owns_result</B> and<B> object_owns_parameters
</B>SOM IDL modifiers. These modifiers signify that the object, rather than
the caller, is responsible for freeing the memory associated with the parameter/result.
For "in" parameters, the object can free the memory any time after receiving
it; for "inout" and "out" parameters, and for return results, the object
will free the memory sometime before the object is destroyed. (See the section
entitled "Implementation statements" in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM
Compiler," for more information on these modifiers.)
<P>
When a DSOM client program makes a remote method invocation, via a proxy,
and the method being invoked has an object-owned parameter or return result,
then the client-side memory associated with the parameter/result will be
owned by the caller's proxy, and the server-side memory will be owned by
the remote object. The memory owned by the caller's proxy will be freed
when the proxy is released by the client program. (The time at which the
server-side memory will be freed depends on the implementation of the remote
object.)
<P>
A DSOM client can also instruct a proxy object to free all memory that it
owns on behalf of the client without releasing the proxy (assuming that
the client program is finished using the object-owned memory), by invoking
the<B> somdReleaseResource</B> method on the proxy object. Calling<B> somdReleaseResources
</B>can prevent unused memory from accumulating in a proxy.
<P>
For example, consider a client program repeatedly invoking a remote method
"get_string", which returns a string that is designated (in SOM IDL) as
"object-owned". The proxy on which the method is invoked will store the
memory associated with all the returned strings, even if the strings are
not unique, until the proxy is released. If the client program only uses
the last result returned from "get_string", then unused memory accumulates
in the proxy. The client program can prevent this by invoking<B> somdReleaseResources
</B>on the proxy object periodicall (for example, each time it finishes
using the result of the last "get_string" call).
