<H1>Threads and thread safety</H1><!-- entering slot 406 -->
<P>
As indicated earlier, on OS/2, interactive programs call<B> someProcessEvents
</B>in one thread and process keyboard input in a separate thread. (This
recommended usage is illustrated in the sample program). The event manager
object (EMan) is thread safe in the sense that concurrent method invocations
on EMan are serialized. Even when<B> someProcessEvents</B> is invoked in
a thread and other methods of EMan are invoked from other threads, EMan
still preserves its data integrity. However, when Eman dispatches an event,
a callback can call methods on the same data objects as the other interactive
thread(s). The user must protect such data objects using appropriate concurrency
control techniques (for example by using semaphores).
<P>
One must also be aware of some deadlock possibilities. Consider the following
situation. EMan code holds some SOMobjects Toolkit semaphores while it is
running (for example, while in<B> someProcessEvents</B>). A user-defined
object protects its data by requiring its methods to acquire and release
a sempahore on the object. If a separate thread running in this object were
to call an operation that requires a SOMobjects Toolkit semaphore (which
is currently held by EMan) and if concurrently EMan dispatches an event
whose callback invokes a method of this object, a deadlock occurs. Two possibilities
exist to cope with such a situation: One is to acquire all needed semaphores
ahead of time, and the other is to abort the operation when you fail to
obtain a semaphore. To achieve mutual exclusion with EMan, you can call
the methods<B> someGetEManSem</B> and<B> someReleaseEmanSem</B>. These methods
acquire and release the SOMobject Developer Toolkit semaphores that EMan
uses.
