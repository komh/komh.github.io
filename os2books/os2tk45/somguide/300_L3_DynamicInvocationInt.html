<H1>Dynamic Invocation Interface</H1><!-- entering slot 343 -->
<P>
DSOM supports the CORBA dynamic invocation interface (DII), which clients
can use to dynamically build and invoke requests on objects. This section
describes how to use the DSOM DII. Currently, DSOM supports dynamic request
invocation only on objects outside the address space of the request initiator,
via proxies. The<B> somDispatch</B> method (non-CORBA) can be used to invoke
methods dynamically on either local or remote objects, however.
<P>
To invoke a request on an object using the DII, the client must explicitly
construct and initiate the request. A request is comprised of an object
reference, an operation, a list of arguments for the operation, and a return
value from the operation. A key to proper construction of the request is
the correct usage of the<B> NamedValue</B> structure and the<B> NVList</B> object.
The return value for an operation is supplied to the request in the form
of a NamedValue structure. In addition, it is usually most convenient to
supply the arguments for a request in the form of an<B> NVList</B> object,
which is an ordered set of<B> NamedValues.</B> This section begins with
a description of<B> NamedValues</B> and<B> NVLists</B> and then details
the procedure for building and initiating requests.
