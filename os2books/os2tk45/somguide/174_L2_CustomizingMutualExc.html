<H1>Customizing Mutual Exclusion Services (Thread Safety)</H1><!-- entering slot 209 -->
<P>
The SOM kernel and the other SOMobjects frameworks (DSOM, Persistence, Replication,
and so on), have been made thread safe with respect to multi-threaded processes.
As used here, "thread safe" means that the SOMobjects run time has been
implemented using<I> mutual exclusion semaphores</I> to protect sections
of the code which must only be executed by a single thread in a multi-threaded
application process at one time.
<P>
Some operating systems provide native multi-threading (for example, OS/2.)
On other operating systems that do not support native multi-threading (such
as, AIX 3.2), thread support may be provided as part of particular programming
environments (like DCE) or libraries.
<P>
It is vital that SOM employ the mutex services that are provided by the
thread package used by the application. Consequently, SOM provides a mechanism
for defining and customizing mutex services.
<P>
Five mutex service functions are used to implement mutual exclusion in SOM.
These functions are called indirectly via the global pointer variables defined
below. A<B> somToken</B> parameter (called "sem" below) is used as a generic
"handle to refer to a mutex semaphore - usually it is a pointer to a mutex
semaphore variable or data structure. The actual representation of the mutex
semaphore is hidden by the functions.
<PRE>unsigned long <B>(*SOMCreateMutexSem)</B>(somToken *sem);
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function creates a mutex semaphore, whose handle is returned
as an output parameter in the<B> somToken</B> variable identified by  "sem".
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long <B>(*SOMRequestMutexSem)</B>(somToken sem);</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function requests ownership of the mutex semaphore identified
by the parameter,<I> sem.</I> If the semaphore is not currently owned by
another thread, ownership is assigned to the calling thread. Otherwise,
the calling thread is blocked until the semaphore is released by the current
owner.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
<I>Important:</I> If the same thread calls<B> SOMRequestMutexSem</B> multiple
times, a reference count must be kept, so that the semaphore is released
only after the same number of calls to<B> SOMReleaseMutexSem.</B> Some,
but not all, thread packages provide reference counting automatically, via
"counting semaphores."<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned. Otherwise,  a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long<B>(*SOMReleaseMutexSem)</B>(somToken sem);</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function releases ownership of the mutex semaphore identified
by the parameter,<I> sem.</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

times, a reference count must be kept, so that the semaphore is released

<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function destroys the a mutex semaphore identified by the
parameter,<I> sem.</I><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned. Otherwise, a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long <B>(*SOMGetThreadId)</B>();</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function returns a small integer identifier for the calling
thread. The ID cannot be associated with any other thread in the process.
The ID is used as an index for table lookups.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If threads are not supported, the function must return 0.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The actual mutex service function prototypes and global variable declarations
are found in file "somapi.h".
<P>
If the underlying operating system supports native multi-threading (currently,
only OS/2), SOM provides appropriate default mutex service function implementations.
On those operating systems that do not support native multi-threading, the
default mutex service functions have null implementations.
<P>
An application may want to use threading services different from those provided
by the underlying operating system (if any); for example, DCE applications
will want to use DCE threads. In that case, the default mutex service functions
can be replaced by application-defined functions.
<P>
An application program would use code similar to the following to install
the replacement routines:
<PRE>#include &lt;som.h&gt;/* Define a replacement routine: */
unsigned long myCreateMutexSem (somToken *sem)
{
    (Customized code <!-- entering slot 210 -->goes here)
}
...      <B>
SOMCreateMutexSem</B>= myCreateMutexSem;
</PRE>

<P>
It is important to install custom mutex service functions before any SOM
calls are made.
