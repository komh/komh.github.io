<H1>Using name-lookup method resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 51 -->
<P>
<U><I>For C/C++  programmers</I></U>:  Offset resolution is the most efficient
way to select the method procedure appropriate to a given method call. Client
programs can, however, invoke a method using "name-lookup" resolution instead
of offset resolution. The C and C++ bindings for method invocation use offset
resolution by default, but methods defined with the<B> namelookup</B> SOM
IDL modifier result in C bindings in which the short form invocation macro
uses name-lookup resolution instead.  Also, for both C and C++ bindings,
a special<I> lookup_&lt;methodName&gt;</I> macro is defined.
<P>
Name-lookup resolution is appropriate in the case where a programmer knows
at compile time which arguments will be expected by a method (that is, its
<I>signature</I>), but does not know the<U> type</U> of the object on which
the method will be invoked. For example, name-lookup resolution can be used
when two different classes introduce different methods of the same name
and signature, and it is not known which method should be invoked (because
the type of the object is not known at compile time).
<P>
Name-lookup resolution is also used to invoke<I> dynamic methods</I> (that
is, methods that have been added to a class's interface at run time rather
than being specified in the class's IDL specification). For more information
on name-lookup method resolution, see the topic "Method Resolution" in Chapter
4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler."
<P>
<U><I>For C</I></U>: To invoke a method using name-lookup resolution, when
using the C bindings for a method that has been implemented with the<U><I> namelookup
</I></U>modifier, use either of the following macros:
<P>
 _&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver, args</I>)
<BR>

<P>
<B>lookup_</B>&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver, args</I>)
<P>
Thus, the short-form method invocation macro results in name-lookup resolution
(rather than offset resolution), when the method has been defined as a<B> namelookup
</B>method. (The long form of the macro for offset resolution is still available
in the C usage bindings.) If the method takes a variable number of arguments,
then the first form shown above is used when supplying a variable number
of arguments, and the second form is used when supplying a<B> va_list</B> argument
in place of the variable number of arguments.
<P>
<U><I>For C++</I></U>: To invoke a method using name-lookup resolution,
when using the C++ bindings for a method that has been defined with the
<U><I>namelookup</I></U> modifier, use either of the following macros:
<P>
<B> lookup_</B>&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver, args)</I>
<P>
<I> &lt;className&gt;</I><B>_lookup_</B>&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver,
args)
<BR>
</I>
<P>
If the method takes a variable number of arguments, then the first form
shown above is used when supplying a variable number of arguments, and the
second form is used when supplying a<B> va_list</B> argument in place of
the variable number of arguments. Note that the offset-resolution forms
for invoking methods using the C++ bindings are also still available, even
if the method has been defined as a<B> namelookup</B> method.
<P>
<U><I>For C/C++</I></U>  To invoke a method using name-lookup resolution,
when the method has<U> not</U> been defined as a<U><I> namelookup</I></U> method:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the<B> somResolveByName</B> procedure (described
in the following section)<B>,</B> or any of the methods<B> somLookupMethod,
somFindMethod</B> or<B> somFindMethodOk</B> to obtain a pointer to the procedure
that implements the desired method.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Then, invoke the desired method by calling that procedure,
passing the method's intended receiver, the<B> Environment</B> pointer (if
needed), the<B> context</B> argument (if needed), and the remainder of the
method's arguments, if any.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> somLookupMethod, somFindMethod</B> and<B> somFindMethodOK</B> methods
are invoked on a class object  (the class of the method receiver should
be used), and take as an argument the<B> somId</B> for the desired method
(which can be obtained from the method's name using the<B> somIdFromString
</B>function). For more information on these methods, see the<I> System
Object Model Programming Reference</I>.
<P>
<B>Important Note</B>: SOM provides many ways for a SOM user to acquire
a pointer to a method procedure. Once this is done, it becomes the user's
responsibility to make appropriate use of this procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the procedure should only be used on objects
for which this is appropriate-otherwise, run-time errors are likely to result.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, when the procedure is used, it is essential
that the compiler be given correct information concerning the signature
of the method and the linkage required by the method.  (On many systems,
there are different ways to pass method arguments, and linkage information
tells a compiler how to pass the arguments indicated by a method's signature).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
SOM method procedures on OS/2 must be called with "system" linkage.  On
AIX, there is only one linkage convention for procedure calls. While C and
C++ provide standard ways to indicate a method signature, the way to indicate
linkage information depends on the<!-- entering slot 52 --> specific compiler
and system.  For each method declared using OIDL or IDL,  the C and C++
usage bindings therefore use conditional macros and a typedef to name a
type that has the correct linkage convention. This type name can then be
used by programmers with access to the usage bindings for the class that
introduces the method whose procedure pointer is used. The type is named
<B>somTD_</B><I>&lt;className&gt;</I><B>_</B><I>&lt;methodName&gt;</I>.
This is illustrated in the following example, and further details are provided
in the section below, titled "Obtaining a method's procedure pointer."
