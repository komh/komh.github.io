<H1>Considerations re: 'somInit' initialization from earlier SOM releases</H1><!-- entering slot 183 -->
<P>
<B>To re-emphasize:</B> All code written prior to SOMobjects Release 2.1
using documented guidelines for the earlier initialization approach based
on the<B> somInit</B> method (as well as all existing class binaries) continues
to be fully supported and useful.
<P>
Prior to SOMobjects 2.1, initialization was done with initializer methods
that would simply "chain" parent-method calls upward, thereby allowing the
execution of initializer method procedures contributed by all ancestors
of an object's class. This chaining of initializer calls was not supported
in any special way by the SOM API. Parent-method calls are simply one of
the possible idioms available to users of OOP in SOM, easily available to
a SOM class designer as a result of the support provided by the SOMobjects
Toolkit emitters for parent-method calls.
<P>
So, SOM did not constrain initialization to be done in any particular way
or require the use of any particular ordering of the method procedures of
ancestor classes.  But, SOM did provide an overall framework that class
designers could easily utilize in order to implement default initialization
of SOM objects. This framework is provided by the<B> somInit</B> object-initializatio
method introduced by the<B> SOMobject</B> class and supported by the SOM
Toolkit emitters. The emitters create an implementation template file with
stub procedures for overridden methods that automatically chain parent-method
calls upward through parent classes. Many of the class methods that perform
object creation called<B> somInit</B> automatically.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> These will now call<B> somDefaultInit,</B> which in turn calls
<B>somInit</B> for legacy code, as described in the previous topic.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Because it takes no arguments,<B> somInit</B> best served the purpose of
a default initializer. SOM programmers also had the option of introducing
additional "non-default" initialization methods that took arguments. In
addition, by using metaclasses, they could introduce new class methods as
object constructors that first create an object (generally using<B> somNewNoInit</B>.)
and then invoke some non-default initializer on the new object.
<P>
For a number of reasons, the<B> somInit</B> framework has been augmented
by recognizing<I> initializers</I> special kind of method in SOMobjects.
One advantage of this approach is that special metaclasses are no longer
required for defining constructors that take arguments. Instead, because
the<B> init</B> modifier identifies initializers, usage-binding emitters
can now provide these constructors. This results in simpler designs and
more efficient programs.
<P>
Although<B> somDefaultInit</B> replaces<B> somInit</B>  as the no-argument
initializer used for SOM objects, all previous use of<B> somInit</B> is
still supported by the SOMobjects Developers Toolkit on AIX, OS/2 and 16-bit
Windows. You may continue to use<B> somInit</B> on these systems if you
like, although this is somewhat less efficient than using<B> somDefaultInit.
</B>
<P>
However, you cannot use both methods. In particular, if a class overrides
both<B> somDefaultInit</B>  and<B> somInit</B>, its<B> somInit</B> code
will never be executed. It is recommended that you always override<B>  somDefaultInit
</B>for object initialization. For one thing, it is likely that when SOMobjects
is ported to new systems,<B> somInit</B> (and<B> somUninit</B>) may not
be supported on those systems. Thus, code written using these (obsolete)
methods will be less<!-- entering slot 184 --> portable.
