<H1>Name-lookup resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 159 -->
<P>
Name-lookup resolution is similar to the method resolution techniques employed
by Objective-C and Smalltalk. It is currently about five times slower than
offset resolution. It is more flexible, however. In particular, name-lookup
resolution, unlike offset resolution, can be used when:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the method to be invoked isn't known until
run time, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The method is added to the class interface at run
time, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the class introducing the method isn't
known until run time.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example, a client program may use two classes that define two different
methods of the same name, and it might not be known until run time which
of the two methods should be invoked (because, for example, it will not
be known until run time which class's instance the method will be applied
to).
<P>
Name-lookup resolution is always performed by a class, so it requires a
method call. (Offset resolution, by contrast, requires no method calls.)
To perform name-lookup method resolution, the class of the intended receiver
object obtains a method procedure pointer for the desired method  that is
appropriate for its instances. In general, this will require a name-based
search through various data structures maintained by ancestor classes.
<P>
Offset and name-lookup resolution achieve the same net effect (that is,
they select the same method procedure); they just achieve it differently
(via different mechanisms for locating the method's method token). Offset
resolution is faster, because it does not require searching for the method
token, but name-lookup resolution is more flexible.
<P>
When defining (in SOM IDL) the interface to a class of objects, the class
implementor can decide, for each method, whether the SOM Compiler will generate
usage bindings that support name-lookup resolution for invoking the method.
Regardless of whether this is done, however, application programs using
the class can have SOM use either technique, on a per-method-call basis.
Chapter 3, "Using SOM Classes in Client Programs," describes how client
programs invoke methods.
