<H1>Parent class vs. metaclass</H1><!-- entering slot 152 -->
<P>
There is a distinct difference between the notions of "parent" (or base)
class and "metaclass." Both notions are related to the fact that a class
defines the methods and variables of its instances, which are therefore
called<I> instance methods</I> and<I> instance variables</I>.
<P>
A<U> parent</U> of a given class is a class from which the given class is
<I>derived </I> by<I> subclassing</I>. (Thus, the given class is called
a<I> child</I> or a<I> subclass</I>  of the parent.) A parent class is a
class from which instance methods and instance variables are<U> inherited</U>.
For example, the parent of class "Dog" might be class "Animal". Hence, the
instance methods and variables introduced by "Animal" (such as methods for
breathing and eating, or a variable for storing an animal's weight) would
also apply to instances of "Dog", because "Dog"<I> inherits</I> these from
"Animal", its parent class. As a result, any given dog instance would be
able to breath and eat, and would have a weight.
<P>
A<I> metaclass</I> is a class whose instances are class objects, and whose
instance methods and instance variables (as described above) are therefore
the methods and variables of class objects. For this reason, a<U> metaclass
</U>is said to define<U> class methods</U>-the methods that a class object
performs. For example, the metaclass of "Animal" might be "AnimalMClass",
which defines the methods that can be invoked on class "Animal" (such as,
to create Animal instances-objects that are not classes, like an individual
pig or cat or elephant or dog).
<P>
Note: It is important to distinguish the methods of a class object (that
is, the methods that can be invoked on the class object, which are defined
by its metaclass) from the methods that the class defines for its instances.

<P>
To summarize: the parent of a class provides inherited methods that the
class's<U> instances</U> can perform; the<U> metaclass</U> of a class provides
class methods that the<U> class itself</U> can perform.  These distinctions
are further summarized below: The distinctions between parent class and
metaclass are summarized in A class has both parent classes and a metaclass.

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> parent</I> class(es) of "C" provide the inherited
<I>instance methods</I> that individual instances (objects "O{i}") of class
"C" can perform. Instance methods that an instance "O{i}" performs might
include (a) initializing itself, (b) performing computations using its instance
variables, (c) printing its instance variables, or (d) returning its size.
New instance methods are defined by "C" itself, in addition to those inherited
from C's parent classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> metaclass</I> "M"defines the<I> class methods
</I>that class "C" can perform. For example, class methods defined by metaclass
"M" include those that allow "C" to (a) inherit its parents' instance methods
and instance variables, (b) tell its own name, (c) create new instances,
and (d) tell how many instance methods it supports. These methods are inherited
from SOMClass. Additional methods supported by "M" might allow "C" to count
how many instances it creates.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Each class "C" has one or more parent classes and
exactly one metaclass.  (The single exception is SOMObject, which has no
parent class.)  Parent class(es) must be explicitly identified in the IDL
declaration of a class. (SOMObject is given as a parent if no subsequently-derived
class applies.)  If a metaclass is not explicitly listed, the SOM run time
will determine an applicable metaclass.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An instance of a metaclass is always another<I> class
object</I>. For example, class "C" is an instance of metaclass "M".  SOMClass
is the SOM-provided metaclass from which all subsequent metaclasses are
derived.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A metaclass has its own inheritance hierarchy (through its parent classes)
that is independent of its instances' inheritance hierarchies. For example,
suppose a series of classes is defined (or derived), stemming from<B> SOMObject.
</B>The child class (or subclass) at the end of this line ("C[2]") inherits
instance methods from all of its ancestor classes (here,<B> SOMObject</B>
and "C[1]"). An instance created by "C2" can perform any of these instance
methods.  In an analogous manner, a line of metaclasses can be defined,
stemming from<B> SOMClass.</B> Just as a new class is derived from an existing
class (such as<B> SOMObject</B>), a new metaclass is derived from an existing
metaclass (such as<B> SOMClass</B>). Parentclassesandmetaclasseseachhavetheirown
