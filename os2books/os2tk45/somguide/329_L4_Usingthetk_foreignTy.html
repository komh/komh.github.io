<H1>Using the 'tk_foreign' TypeCode</H1><!-- entering slot 378 -->
<P>
<B>TypeCode</B>s can be used to partially describe types that cannot be
described in IDL (for example, a FILE type in C, or a specific class type
in C++). The SOM-unique extension<B> tk_foreign</B> is used for this purpose.
A<B>  tk_foreign TypeCode</B> contains three parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the type,<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An implementation context string, and<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A length.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The implementation context string can be used to carry an arbitrarily long
description that identifies the context where the foreign type can be used
and understood. If the length of the type is also known, it can be provided
with the length parameter. If the length is not known or is not constant,
it should be specified as zero. If the length is not specified, it will
default to the size of a pointer. A<B> tk_foreign TypeCode</B>  can also
have alignment information specified, just like any other<B> TypeCode</B>.

<P>
Using the following steps causes the SOM Compiler to create a foreign<B> TypeCode
</B>in the Interface Repository:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define the foreign type as a<B> typedef</B> SOMFOREIGN
in the IDL source file.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the<B> #pragma modifier</B> statement to
supply the additional information for the<B> TypeCode</B> as modifiers.
The implementation context information is supplied using the "impctx" modifier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Compile the IDL file using the<B> -u</B> option
to place the information in the Interface Repository.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For example:
<PRE>typedef SOMFOREIGN Point;#pragma modifier Point: impctx="C++ Point class",length=12,align=4;
</PRE>

<P>
If a foreign type is used to define instance data, structs, unions, attributes,
or methods in an IDL source file, it is your responsibility to ensure that
the implementation and/or usage bindings contain an appropriate definition
of the type that will satisfy your compiler. You can use the<B> passthru
</B>statement in your IDL file to supply this definition. However, it is
<I>not</I> recommended that you expose foreign data in attributes, methods,
or any of the public types, if this can be avoided, because there is no
guarantee that appropriate usage binding information can be provided for
all languages. If you know that all users of the class will be using the
same implementation language that your class uses, you may be able to disregard
this recommendation.
