<P>
The SOM run-time library provides a set of<I> functions</I> used primarily
for creating objects and invoking methods on them. The<I> data structures
</I>and<I> objects</I> that are created, maintained, and used by the functions
in the SOM run-time library constitute the<B> SOM run-time environment</B>.

<P>
A distinguishing characteristic of the SOM run-time environment is that
SOM<U> classes</U> are represented by run-time<U> objects</U>; these objects
are called<U> class objects</U>.  By contrast, other object-oriented languages
such as C++ treat classes strictly as compile-time structures that have
no properties at run time. In SOM, however, each class has a corresponding
run-time object. This has three advantages:  First, application programs
can access information about a class at run time, including its relationships
with other classes, the methods it supports, the size of its instances,
and so on. Second, because much of the information about a class is established
at run time rather than at compile time, application programs needn't be
recompiled when this information changes. Finally, because class objects
can be instances of user-defined classes in SOM, users can adapt the techniques
for subclassing and inheritance in order to build object-oriented solutions
to problems that are otherwise not easily addressed within an OOP context.
