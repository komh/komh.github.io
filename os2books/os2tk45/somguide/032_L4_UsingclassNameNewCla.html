<H1>Using <className>NewClass</H1><!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
The C and C++ usage bindings for a SOM class also provide static linkage
to a &lt;className&gt;<B>NewClass</B> function that can be used to create
the class object.  This can be useful if the class object is needed before
its instances are created.
<P>
For example, the following C code uses the function<B> HelloNewClass</B> to
create the "Hello" class object. The arguments to this function are defined
by the usage bindings, and indicate the version of the class implementation
that is assumed by the bindings. (For more detail on creation of classes,
see the later section, "Creating a class object.") Once the class object
has been created, the example invokes the method<B> somGetInstanceSize</B>
on this class to determine the size of a "Hello" object, uses<B> SOMMalloc
</B>to allocate storage, and then uses the<B> HelloRenew</B> macro to create
ten instances of the "Hello" class:
<PRE>   #include &lt;hello.h&gt;
   main()
   {
   SOMClass helloCls; /*  A pointer for the Hello class object */
   Hello objA[10];    /*  an array of Hello instances */
   unsigned char *buffer;
   int i;
   int size;

   /* create the Hello class object:  */
   helloCls =  <B>HelloNewClass</B>(Hello_MajorVersion, Hello_MinorVersion);

   /* get the amount of space needed for a Hello instance:
    * (somGetInstanceSize is a method provided by SOM.) */
   size =  <B>_somGetInstanceSize</B>(helloCls);
   size = ((size+3)/4)*4;  /* round up to doubleword multiple */

   /* allocate the total space needed for ten instances: */
   buffer =  <B>SOMMalloc</B>(10*size);

   /* convert the space into ten separate Hello instances: */
   for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
       objA[i] = <B>HelloRenew</B>(buffer+i*size);
   ...
   ...
   /* Uninitialize the objects and free them */
   for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
     <B>_somDestruct(objA[i],0,0);</B>
   <B>SOMFree</B>(buffer);
   }
</PRE>

<P>
When an object created with the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>Renew</B> macro
is no longer needed, its storage must be freed using the dual to whatever
method was originally used to allocate the storage. Two method pairs are
typical:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For example, if an object was originally initialized
using the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> macro, then, as discussed previously,
the client should use the<B> somFree</B>  method on it.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On the other hand, if the program uses the<B> SOMMalloc
</B>function to allocate memory, as illustrated in the example above, then
the<B> SOMFree</B> function must be called to free the objects' storage
(because<B> SOMFree</B> is the dual to<B> SOMMalloc</B>). Before this is
done, the objects in the region to be freed should be deinitialized by invoking
the<B> somDestruct</B> method on them. This allows each object to free any
memory that may have been allocated without the programmer's knowledge.
(The<B> somFree</B> method also calls the<B> somDestruct</B> method.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> In the<B> somDestruct</B> method call above, the first zero
indicates that memory should not be freed by the class of the object (that
is, the programmer will do it explicitly).  The second zero indicates that
the class of the object is responsible for overall control of object uninitialization.
 For further discussion, see Section 5.5, "Initializing and Uninitializing
Objects," in Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM."<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<U><I>For C++ programmers with usage bindings,</I></U> instances of a class
&lt;className&gt; can be created with a<B> new</B> operator provided by
the usage bindings of each SOM class.  The<B> new</B> operator automatically
creates the class object for &lt;className&gt;, as well as its ancestor
classes and metaclass,  if they do not yet exist.  After verifying the existence
of the desired class object, the<B> new</B> operator then invokes the<B> somNewNoInit
</B> method on the class.  This allocates memory and creates a new instance
of the class,  but it does not initialize the new object. Initialization
of the new object is then performed using one of the C++ constructors defined
by the usage bindings.  (For further discussion, see Section 5.5 "Initializing
and Uninitializing Objects," in Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM.")
Two variations of the<B> new</B> operator require no arguments. When either
is used, the C++ usage bindings provide a<!-- entering slot 42 --> default
constructor that invokes the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method on the new object.
 Thus, a new object initialized by<B> somDefaultInit</B> would be created
using either of the forms:
<P>
<B>new</B> &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B> new</B>&lt;<I> classname</I> &gt;
( )
<P>
For example:
<PRE>   obj = new Hello;
   obj1 = new Hello();
</PRE>

<P>
For convenience, pointers to SOM objects created using the<B> new</B>operator
can be freed using the<B> delete</B> operator, just as for normal C++ objects
(or, the<B> somFree</B> method could be used):
<PRE>  delete obj;
  obj1-&gt;somFree;
</PRE>

<P>
When previously allocated space will be used to hold a new object, C++ programmers
should use the<B> somRenew</B> method, described below. C++ bindings do
not provide a macro for this purpose.
<P>
<U><I>somNew and somRenew:</I></U> C and C++ programmers, as well programmers
using other languages, can create instances of a class using the SOM methods
<B>somNew</B> and<B> somRenew</B>, invoked on the class object. As discussed
and illustrated above for the C bindings, the class object must first be
created using the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B> procedure (or,
perhaps, using the<B> somFindClass</B> method-see the section "Using class
objects," to follow later in this chapter).
<P>
The<B> somNew</B> method invoked on the class object creates a new instance
of the class, initializes the object using<B> somDefaultInit,</B> and then
returns a pointer to the new object. For instance, the following C example
creates a new object of the "Hello" class.
<PRE>   #include &lt;hello.h&gt;
   main()
   {
     SOMClass helloCls;   /* a pointer to the Hello class */
     Hello obj;           /* a pointer to an Hello instance */
     /* create the Hello class  */
     helloCls = HelloNewClass(Hello_MajorVersion, Hello_MinorVersion);
     obj = _somNew(helloCls); /* create the Hello instance */
   }
</PRE>

<P>
An object created using the<B> somNew</B> method should be freed by invoking
the<B> somFree</B> method on it after the client program is finished using
the object.
<P>
The<B> somRenew</B> method invoked on the class object creates a new instance
of a class using the given space, rather than allocating new space for the
object. The method converts the given space into an instance of the class,
initializes the new object using<B> somDefaultInit,</B> and then returns
a pointer to it. The argument to<B> somRenew</B> must point to a block of
storage large enough to hold the new instance. The method<B> somGetInstanceSize
</B>can be used to determine the amount of memory required. For example,
the following C++ code creates ten instances of the "Hello" class:
<PRE>   #include &lt;hello.xh&gt;
   #include &lt;somcls.xh&gt;
   main()
   {
     SOMClass *helloCls; // a pointer to the Hello class
     Hello *objA[10]  //  an array of Hello instance pointers
     unsigned char *buffer;
     int i;
     int size;

    // create the Hello class object
    helloCls =  <B>HelloNewClass</B>(Hello_MajorVersion, Hello_MinorVersion);

    // get the amount of space needed for a Hello instance:
    size = helloCls-&gt; <B>somGetInstanceSize</B>();
    size = ((size+3)/4)*4;  // round up to doubleword multiple

    // allocate the total space needed for ten instances
    buffer =  <B>SOMMalloc</B>(10*size);

    // convert the space into ten separate Hello objects
    for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
       objA[i] = helloCls-&gt; <B>somRenew</B>(buffer+i*size);

    // Uninitialize the objects and free them
    for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
       objA[i]-&gt; <B>somDestruct</B>(0,0);
    <B>SOMFree</B>(buffer);
   }
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> somNew</B>  and<B> somRenew</B> methods are useful for creating instances
of a class when the header file for the class is not included in the client
program at compile time. (The name of the class might be specified by user
input, for example.) However, the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> macro
(for C) and the<B> new</B> operator (for C++) can<I> only</I> be used for
classes whose header file is included in the client program at compile time.

<P>
Objects created using the<B> somRenew</B> method should be freed by the
client program that allocated it, using the dual to whatever allocation
approach was initially used. If the<B> somFree</B> method is not appropriate
(because the method<B> somNew</B> was not initially used), then, before
memory is freed, the object should be explicitly deinitialized by invoking
the<B> somDestruct</B> method on it. (The<B> somFree</B> method calls the
<B>somDestruct</B> method.  Refer to the previous C example for<B> Renew
</B>for an explanation of the arguments to<B> somDestruct.</B>)
