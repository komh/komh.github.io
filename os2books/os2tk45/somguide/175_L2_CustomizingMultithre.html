<H1>Customizing Multi-threading Services</H1><!-- entering slot 211 -->
<P>
Although the SOM kernel and the other SOMobjects frameworks allow applications
to be multi-threaded, the kernel and frameworks generally do not require
or exploit threads themselves. But there are some exceptions: for example,
application servers in DSOM can be configured so that each incoming request
is executed on a separate thread.
<P>
An application may choose to employ "native" multi-threading services provided
by the underlying operating system (for example, OS/2). On other operating
systems that do not support native multi-threading (such as, AIX 3.2), thread
support may be provided as part of particular programming environments (like
DCE) or libraries.  SOM provides a mechanism that allows an application
to define and customize the multi-threading services used by SOMobjects
frameworks.
<P>
Four thread service functions are defined for use by SOMobjects frameworks.
These functions may be called indirectly via the global pointer variables
defined below. A somToken parameter (called "thrd" below) is used as a generic
"handle" to refer to a thread # usually it is a pointer to a thread id or
descriptor. The actual representation of the thread handle is hidden by
the functions.
<PRE>typedef void somTD_SOMThreadProc(void * data);

unsigned long (<B>*SOMStartThread</B>)(somToken *thrd,
                                somTD_SOMThreadProc proc,
                                void *data,
                                unsigned long datasz,
                                unsigned long stacksz);
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function starts a thread, and returns a thread handle in
the somToken variable identified by "thrd".  The thread executes the procedure
whose address is specified by the  proc parameter; the thread procedure
takes a single void* argument and returns void. The data parameter passed
to<B> SOMStartThread</B> is passed on to the thread procedure; the size
of the data parameter, in bytes, is given by datasz.  A stack of stacksz
bytes will be allocated for the thread.
<P>
Note: On OS/2, the thread procedure must be compiled with _Optlink linkage.)
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long (<B>*SOMEndThread</B>)(void);</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function terminates the calling thread.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned. Otherwise,  a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long (<B>*SOMKillThread</B>)(somToken thrd);</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function terminates the thread identified by the input parameter
thrd.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>unsigned long (<B>*SOMGetThreadHandle</B>)(somToken * thrd);</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
The referenced function returns a handle that can be used to identify the
calling thread. The handle is returned in the somToken variable pointed
to by thrd.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If the call succeeds, a 0 is returned. Otherwise, a non-zero error code
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The actual mutex service function prototypes and global variable declarations
are found in file "somthrd.h".
<P>
If the underlying operating system supports native multi-threading (currently,
only OS/2), SOM provides appropriate default multi-threading service function
implementations. On those operating systems that do not support native multi-threading,
the default multi-threading service functions have null implementations.

<P>
An application may want to use threading services different from those provided
by the underlying operating system (if any); for example, DCE applications
will want to use DCE threads. In that case, the default multi-threading
service functions can be replaced by application#defined functions.
<P>
An application program would use code similar to the following to install
the replacement routines:
<PRE>#include &lt;somthrd.h&gt;/* Define a replacement routine: */
unsigned long myStartThread (somToken *thrd,
                             somTD_SOMThreadProc proc,
                             void *data,
                             unsigned long datasz,
                             unsigned long stacksz)
{
    (Customized code goes here)
}
...    <B>
SOMStartThread =</B>myStartThread;
</PRE>

<P>
It is important to install custom multi-threading service functions before
any SOM calls are made.
