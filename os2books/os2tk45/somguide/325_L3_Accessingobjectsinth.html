<H1>Accessing objects in the Interface Repository</H1><!-- entering slot 372 -->
<P>
As mentioned above, one instance of the<B> Repository</B>  class exists
for the entire SOM Interface Repository. This object does not, itself, reside
in the Interface Repository (hence it does not exhibit any of the behavior
defined by the<B> Contained</B> class). It is, however, a<B> Container</B>,
and it holds all<B> ConstantDef</B>s,<B> TypeDef</B>s,<B> ExceptionDef</B>s,
<B>InterfaceDef</B>s, and<B> ModuleDef</B>s that are global in scope (that
is, not contained inside of any other<B> Container</B>s).
<P>
When any method provided by the<B> Repository</B> class is used to locate
other objects in the Interface Repository, those objects are automatically
instantiated and activated. Consequently, when the program is finished using
an object from the Interface Repository, the client code should release
the object using the<B> somFree</B> method.
<P>
All objects contained in the Interface Repository have both a "name" and
a "Repository ID" associated with them. The name is not guaranteed to be
unique, but it does uniquely identify an object within the context of the
object that contains it. The Repository ID of each object is guaranteed
to uniquely identify that object, regardless of its context.
<P>
For example, two<B> TypeDef</B> objects may have the same name, provided
they occur in separate name scopes (<B>ModuleDef</B>s or<B> InterfaceDef</B>s).
In this case, asking the Interface Repository to locate the<B> TypeDef</B> object
based on its name would result in both<B> TypeDef</B> objects being returned.
On the other hand, if the name is looked up from a particular<B>  ModuleDef
</B>or<B> InterfaceDef</B> object, only the<B> TypeDef</B> object within
the scope of that<B> ModuleDef</B> or<B> InterfaceDef</B> would be returned.
By contrast, once the Repository ID of an object is known, that object can
always be directly obtained from the<B> Repository</B> object via its Repository
ID.
<P>
C or C++ programmers can obtain an instance of the<B> Repository</B> class
using the<B> RepositoryNew</B> macro. Programmers using other languages
(and C/C++ programmers without static linkage to the<B> Repository</B> class)
should invoke the method<B> somGetInterfaceRepository</B> on the<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B>. For example,
<P>
For C or C++ (static linkage):
<PRE>#include &lt;repostry.h&gt;
Repository repo;

repo = RepositoryNew();
</PRE>

<P>
From other languages (and for dynamic linkage in C/C++):<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function to
obtain a pointer to the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>, as described in Chapter
3, "Using SOM Classes."<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the<B> somResolve</B> or<B> somResolveByName
</B>function to obtain a pointer to the<B> somGetInterfaceRepository</B> method
procedure.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Invoke the method procedure on the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>,
with no additional arguments, to obtain a pointer to the<B> Repository</B> object.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After obtaining a pointer to the<B> Repository</B> object, use the methods
it inherits from<B> Container</B> or its own<B> lookup_id</B> method to
instantiate objects in the Interface Repository. As an example, the<B> contents
</B>method shown in the C fragment below activates every object with global
scope in the Interface Repository and returns a sequence containing a pointer
to every global object:
<PRE>#include &lt;containd.h&gt;      /* Behavior common to allIR objects */
Environment *ev;
int i;
sequence(Contained) everyGlobalObject;

ev = SOM_CreateLocalEnvironment(); /* Get an environment to use */
printf ("Every global object in the Interface Repository:\n");

everyGlobalObject = Container_contents (repo, ev, "all", TRUE);

for (i=0; i &lt; everyGlobalObject._length; i++) {
    Contained aContained;

    aContained = (Contained) everyGlobalObject._buffer[i];
    printf ("Name: %s, Id: %s\n",
        Contained__get_name (aContained, ev),
        Contained__get_id (aContained, ev));
    SOMObject_somFree (aContained);
}
</PRE>

<P>
Taking this example one step further, here is a complete program that accesses
every object in the entire Interface Repository. It, too, uses the<B> contents
</B>method, but this time recursively<!-- entering slot 373 --> calls the
<B>contents</B> method until every object in every container has been found:

<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;containd.h&gt;
#include &lt;repostry.h&gt;

void showContainer (Container c, int *next);

main ()
{
    int count = 0;
    Repository repo;

    repo = RepositoryNew ();
    printf ("Every object in the Interface Repository:\n\n");
    showContainer ((Container) repo, &amp;count);
    SOMObject_somFree (repo);
    printf ("%d objects found\n", count);
    exit (0);
}

void showContainer (Container c, int *next)
{
    Environment *ev;
    int i;
    sequence(Contained) everyObject;

    ev = SOM_CreateLocalEnvironment (); /* Get an environment */
    everyObject = Container_contents (c, ev, "all", TRUE);

    for (i=0; i&lt;everyObject._length; i++) {
        Contained aContained;

        (*next)++;
        aContained = (Contained) everyObject._buffer[i];
        printf ("%6d. Type: %-12s id: %s\n", *next,
            SOMObject_somGetClassName (aContained),
            Contained__get_id (aContained, ev));
        if (SOMObject_somIsA (aContained, _Container))
            showContainer ((Container) aContained, next);
        SOMObject_somFree (aContained);
    }
}
</PRE>

<P>
Once an object has been retrieved, the methods and attributes appropriate
for that particular object can then be used to access the information contained
in the object. The methods supported by each class of object in the Interface
Repository, as well as the classes themselves, are documented in the<I> SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit: Programmers Reference Manual.</I>
