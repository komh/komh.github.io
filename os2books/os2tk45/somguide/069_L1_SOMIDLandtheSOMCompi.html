<H1>SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
This chapter first discusses how to define SOM classes and then describes
the SOM Compiler. To allow a class of objects to be implemented in one programming
language and used in another (that is, to allow a SOM class to be language
neutral), the interface to objects of this class must be specified separately
from the objects' implementation.
<P>
To summarize:  As a first step, a file known as the .idl file is used to
declare classes and their methods, using SOM's language#neutral Interface
Definition Language (IDL). Next, the SOM Compiler is run on the .idl file
to produce a template implementation file that contains stub method procedures
for the new and overridden methods; this preliminary code corresponds to
the computer language that will implement the class. Then, the class implementer
fills in the stub procedures with code that implements the methods (or redefines
overridden methods) and sets instance data. (This implementation process
is the subject of Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM.") At this point,
the implementation file can be compiled and linked with a client program
that uses it (as described in Chapter 3, "Using SOM Classes in Client Programs").

<P>
Syntax for SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler are presented in this chapter, along
with helpful information for using them correctly.
