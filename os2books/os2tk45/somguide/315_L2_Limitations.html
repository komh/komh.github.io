<H1>Limitations</H1><!-- entering slot 361 -->
<P>
The following list indicates known limitations of Distributed SOM at the
time of this release.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Currently, objects cannot be moved from one server
to another without changing the object references (i.e., deleting the object,
and creating it anew in another server). This yields all copies of the previous
reference invalid.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> change_implementation</B> method is not
supported. This method, defined by the<B> BOA</B> interface, is intended
to allow an application to change the implementation definition associated
with an object. However, in DSOM, changing the server implementation definition
may render existing object references (which contain the old server ID)
invalid.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Currently, DSOM has a single server activation
policy, which corresponds to CORBA's "shared" activation policy for dynamic
activation, and "persistent" activation policy for manual activation. Other
activation policies, such as "server-per-method" and "unshared" are not
directly supported, and must be implemented by the application.
<P>
Since the unshared server policy is not directly supported, the<B> object_is_ready
</B>and<B> deactivate_obj</B> methods, defined in the<B> BOA</B> interface
have null implementations.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If a server program terminates without calling
<B>deactivate_impl,</B> subsequent attempts to start that server may fail.
The DSOM daemon believes the server is still running until it is told it
has stopped. Attempts to start a server that is believed to be exist results
in an error (SOMDERROR_ServerAlreadyExists).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Currently, file names used in<B> ImplementationDefs
</B>are limited to 255 bytes. Implementations aliases used in<B> ImplementationDefs
</B>are limited to 50 bytes. Class names used in the Implementation Repository
are limited to 50 bytes. Hostnames are limited to 32 bytes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OUT_LIST_MEMORY, IN_COPY_VALUE, and DEPENDENT_LIST
flags, used with Dynamic Invocation Interface, are not yet supported.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> Context::get_values</B> method currently
does not support the flag CTX_RESTRICT_SCOPE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Other important notes concerning DSOM are documented in the "README" file
in the SOMBASE root directory ($SOMBASE on AIX, and %SOMBASE% on OS/2 or
Windows).
