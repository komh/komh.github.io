<H1>Initializing the SOM Object Adapter</H1><!-- entering slot 277 -->
<P>
The next step the server must take before it is ready to accept and process
requests from clients is to create a<B> SOMOA</B> object and initialize
the global variable<B> SOMD_SOMOAObject</B> to point to it. This is accomplished
by the assignment:
<PRE>SOMD_SOMOAObject = SOMOANew();
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<B> SOMOA</B> object is not created automatically by<B> SOMD_Init
</B>because it is only required by server processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
After the global variables have been initialized, the server can do any
application-specific initialization required before processing requests
from clients. Finally, when the server is ready to process requests, it
must call the<B> impl_is_ready</B> method on the<B> SOMOA</B>:
<PRE>_impl_is_ready(SOMD_SOMOAObject, &amp;ev, SOMD_ImplDefObject);
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> SOMOA</B> will then set up a communications port for incoming messages,
which it registers with the DSOM daemon. Once the DSOM daemon has been notified
of the server's port, it assists client applications in "binding" (i.e.,
establishing a connection) to that server.
<P>
The<B> impl_is_ready</B> method also causes the server object, whose class
is defined in the server's<B> ImplementationDef</B>, to be created. The
server object can be referenced through the global variable,<B> SOMD_ServerObject.
