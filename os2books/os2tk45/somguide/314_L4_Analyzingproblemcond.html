<H1>Analyzing problem conditions</H1><!-- entering slot 358 -->
<P>
The DSOM error codes mentioned below can be obtained directly by the application
from the "minor" field of the exception data returned in a system exception,
or from an error report message when SOMDDEBUG is set to a positive integer
value (see the previous topic, "Error reporting").
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  When running<B> regimpl,</B> a "PERSIST_STORE" or
"NO_IMPLEMENT" exception is returned. The DSOM error code is SOMDERROR_IO
or SOMDERROR_NoImplDatabase.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This may indicate that the Implementation Repository
files are not found or cannot be accessed. Verify that SOMDDIR is set correctly,
to a directory that has granted read/write permission to the DSOM user.
(It is best if the directory name is fully qualified.) If the SOMDDIR variable
is not set, verify that the default directory ($SOMBASE/etc/dsom on AIX,
and %SOMBASE%\etc\dsom on OS/2 or Windows) has been set up with the correct
permissions. Ensure that the the files contained in the directory all have
read/write permission granted to the DSOM user.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  When starting<B> somdd,</B> an "INITIALIZE" exception
is returned with error code SOMDAlreadyRunning.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This indicates that there is already an instance of
<B>somdd</B> running.  If the current instance of<B> somdd</B> does not
seem to be responding properly, delete all instances of<B> somdd</B> and
restart a new copy of<B> somdd</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  When starting up a server program, an exception
is returned with a DSOM error code of SOMDERROR_ServerAlreadyExists.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This may indicate that a server process that is already
running has already registered itself with the DSOM daemon,<B> somdd,</B> using
the implementation ID of the desired server program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U> On OS/2, an operating system error occurs indicating
a "stack overflow" condition soon after a the first call to a class DLL.
Rebuilding the DLL with a larger stack size does not help.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This sometimes occurs when a DLL uses, but does not
initialize, the  run time for OS/2. To perform the proper initialization,
a function named "_DLL_InitTerm" must be included in the DLL, and it must
invoke the C Set/2 initialization function, "_CRT_Init."  The _DLL_InitTerm
function is invoked automatically when the DLL is loaded.
<P>
An example _DLL_InitTerm function is included in the DSOM sample code shipped
with the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit for OS/2, in the file "initterm.c".
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U> When running a DSOM application that uses EMan, an
error message is displayed asking that the SOMSOCKETS be set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This may indicate a need to specify the<B> Sockets
</B>subclass to be used with the application. Current choices are<B> TCPIPSockets
</B>for TCP/IP (and<B> TCPIPSockets32</B> on OS/2),<B> NBSockets</B> for
NetBios and<B> IPXSockets</B> for Netware IPX/SPX. Note:Each SOMobjects
package will contain an appropriate subset of Sockets subclasses. Workstation
DSOM includes TCPIPSockets (and<B> TCPIPSockets32</B> onOS/2 ) for TCP/IP.
Workgroup DSOM also includes<B> NBSockets</B> for NetBios and<B> IPXSockets
</B>for Netware.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A remote method invocation fails and an "INTF_REPOS"
exception is returned. The DSOM error code is SOMDERROR_BadDescriptor or
SOMDERROR_ClassNotlnIR.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This may indicate that the interface describing the
method or the method itself cannot be found in the Interface Repository.
Verify that SOMIR is set correctly, and that the IR contains all interfaces
used by<!-- entering slot 359 --> your application.
<P>
If the default SOM IR (supplied with the SOMobjects Toolkit and Runtimes)
is not used by the application, the user's IR must include the interface
definitions for the appropriate<B> Sockets</B> class, server class (derived
from<B> SOMDServer),</B> and the definitions of the standard DSOM exceptions
(found in file "stexcep.idl") that may be returned by a method call.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A SOMDERROR_ClassNotFound error is returned by a
client either when creating a remote object using<B> somdNewObject,</B> or
when finding a server object using<B> somdFindAnyServerByClass.</B> (The
methods are defined on the<B> SOMDObjectMgr</B> class.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This occurs when the class name specified in calls
to<B> somdNewObject</B> or<B> somdFindAnyServerByClass</B> cannot be found
in the Implementation Repository. Make sure that the class name has been
associated with at least one of the server implementations.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A SOMDERROR_ClassNotlnlR error is returned by a
server when creating a new object using<B> somdNewObject, somdCreateObj,
</B>or<B> somdGetClassObj.</B><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This error may result if the DLL for the class cannot
be found. Verify hat:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>the interface of the object can be found in the IR;<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<P>
<LI>the class name is spelled correctly and is appropriately scoped (for
example, the "Printer" class in the "PrintServer" module must have the identifier
"PrintServer:: Printer").<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>This
error can also result when the shared library is statically linked to the
server program, but the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B> procedures
have not been called to initialize the classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U> When invoking a method returns a proxy for a remote
object in the client, a SOMDERROR_NoParentClass error occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This error may result when the class libraries used
to build the proxy class are statically linked to the program, but the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass
</B>procedure have not been called to initialize the classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  Following a method call, the SOM run-time error
message, "A target object failed basic validity checks during method resolution"
is displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Usually this means that the method call was invoked
using a bad object pointer, or the object has been corrupted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A remote object has an attribute or instance variable
that is, or contains, a pointer to a value in memory (for example, a string,
a sequence, an "any"). The attribute or instance variable value is set by
the client with one method call. When the attribute or instance variable
is queried in a subsequent method call, the value referenced by the pointer
is "garbage".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This may occur because DSOM makes a copy  of argument
values in a client call, for use in the remote call. The argument values
are valid for the duration of that call. When the remote call is completed,
the copies of the argument values are freed.
<P>
In a DSOM application, a class should not assume ownership of memory passed
to it in a method parameter unless the IDL description of the method includes
the SOM IDL modifier<B> object_owns_parameters.</B>  Otherwise, if a parameter
value is meant to persist between method invocations, then the object is
responsible for making a copy of the parameter value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A method defines a (char *) parameter that is used
to pass a string input value to an object. The object attempts to print
the string value, but it appears to be "garbage".<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DSOM will support method arguments that are of type
"pointer-to-X" (pointer types are a SOM extension), by dereference the pointer
in the call, and copying the base value. The pointer-to-value is reconstructed
on the server before the actual method call is made.
<P>
While (char *) is commonly used to refer to NULL-terminated strings in C
programs, (char *) could also be a pointer to a single character or to an
array of characters.<!-- entering slot 360 --> Thus, DSOM interprets the
argument type literally as a pointer-to-one-character.
<P>
To correctly pass strings or array arguments, the appropriate CORBA type
should be used (for example, "string" or "char foo[4 ]").<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A segmentation violation occurs when passing an
"any" argument to a method call, where the "any" value is a string, array,
or object reference. Note: The<B> NamedValues</B> used in DII calls use
"any" fields for the argument values.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This error may occur because the  "_value"  field
of the "any" structure does not contain the address of a pointer to the
target string, array, or object reference, as it should. (A common mistake
is to set the "_value" field to the address of the string, array, or object
reference itself.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  When a server program or a server object makes a
call to<B> get_id</B> or to<B> get_SOM_object</B> on a<B> SOMDObject,</B> a
"BAD_OPERATION" exception is returned with an error code of SOMDERROR_WrongRefType.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This error may occur when the operation<B> get_id
</B>is called on a<B> SOMDObject</B> that does not have any user-supplied
<B>ReferenceData</B> (that is, the<B> SOMDObject</B> is a proxy, is nil,
or is a simple "SOM ref" created by<B> create_SOM_ref</B>). Likewise, this
error may occur when the operation<B> get_SOM_object</B> is called on a
<B>SOMDObject</B> that was not created by the<B> create_SOM_ref</B> method.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  A segmentation fault occurs when a<B> SOMD_Uninit
</B>call is executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->This error could occur if the application has already
freed any of the DSOM run-time objects that were allocated by the<B> SOMD_Init
</B>call, including<B> SOMD_ObjectMgr, SOMD_ImplRepObject</B> and<B> SOMD_ORBObject.
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  Unexplained program crashes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Verify that all DSOM environment variables are set,
as described in the earlier section "Configuring DSOM Applications". Verify
that all class libraries are in directories specified in LIBPATH for AIX
and OS/2, or specified in PATH for Windows. Verify that the contents of
the Interface Repository, specified by SOMIR, are correct. Verify that the
contents of the Implementation Repository, specified by SOMDDIR, are correct.
Verify that<B> somdd</B> is running. Set<I> SOMDDEBUG</I> to 1 to obtain
additional DSOM error messages.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<U><I>Symptom:</I></U>  When starting<B> somdd,</B> an "INITIALIZE" error
is returned with error code SOMDERROR_NoSocketsClass.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If SOMSOCKETS is set, verify that the IR contains
the appropriate<B> Sockets</B> interface definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
