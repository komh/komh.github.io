<H1>When initialization fails</H1><!-- entering slot 278 -->
<P>
It is possible that a server will encounter some error when initializing
itself. Servers must attempt to notify DSOM that their activation failed,
using the<B> activate_impl_failed</B> method. This method is called as follows:

<PRE>/* tell the daemon (via SOMOA) that activation failed */
_activate_impl_failed(SOMD_SOMOAObject,&amp;ev, SOMD_ImplDefObject, rc);
</PRE>
Server writers should be aware, however, that until the server's<B> SOMD_ImpldefObject
</B>has been initialized, it is not possible to call the<B> _activate_impl_failed
</B>method on the DSOM daemon.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A server program should not call<B> activate_impl_failed</B> once
it has called<B> impl_is_ready.</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
