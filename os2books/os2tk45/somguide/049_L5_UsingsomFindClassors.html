<H1>Using somFindClass or somFindClsInFile</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
To create a class object when <U> not</U> using the C/C++  language bindings
for the class, or when the class name is<U> not</U> known at compile time:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, initialize the SOM run-time environment by
calling the<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function (unless it is known that the
SOM run-time environment has already been initialized).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Then, use the<B> somFindClass</B> or<B> somFindClsInFile
</B>method to create the class object. (The class must already be defined
in a dynamically linked library, or DLL.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function initializes the SOM run-time environment.
That is, it creates the four primitive SOM objects (<B>SOMClass, SOMObject,
SOMClassMgr,</B> and the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>), and it initializes SOM
global variables. The function takes no arguments and returns a pointer
to the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Although<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> must be called before using
other SOM functions and methods, explicitly calling<B> somEnvironmentNew
</B>is usually not necessary when using the C/C++ bindings,  because the
macros for &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B>,  &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New
</B>, and &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>Renew</B> call it automatically, as
does the<B> new</B> operator for C++. Calling<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> repeatedly
does no harm.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
After the SOM run-time environment has been initialized, the methods<B> somFindClass
</B>and<B> somFindClsInFile</B> can be used to create a class object. These
methods must be invoked on the class manager, which is pointed to by the
global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject.</B>  (It is also returned as the result
of<B> somEnvironmentNew</B>.)
<P>
The<B> somFindClass</B> method takes the following arguments:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>classId</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> A<B> somId</B> identifying the name
of the class to be created. The<B> somIdFromString</B> function returns
a<I> classId</I>  given the name of the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> major
version number</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The expected major version number
of the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> minor version number</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> The
expected minor version number of the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The version numbers are checked against the version numbers built into the
class library to determine if the class is compatible with the client's
expectations.
<P>
The<B> somFindClass</B>  method dynamically loads the DLL containing the
class's implementation, if needed, creates the class object (unless it already
exists) by invoking its &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B> procedure,
and returns a pointer to it. If the class could not be created,<B> somFindClass
</B>returns NULL. For example, the following C code fragment creates the
class "Hello" and stores a pointer to it in "myClass":
<PRE>   SOMClassMgr cm = somEnvironmentNew();   somId classId = somIdFromString("Hello");
   SOMClass myClass =<B> _somFindClass</B>(SOMClassMgrObject, classId
                          Hello_MajorVersion, Hello_MinorVersion);
   ...
   SOMFree(classId);
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> somFindClass</B> method uses<B> somLocateClassFile</B> to get the
name of the library file containing the class. If the class was defined
with a "dllname" class modifier, then<B> somLocateClassFile</B> returns
that file name; otherwise, it assumes that the class name is the name of
the library file. The<B> somFindClsInFile</B> method is similar to<B> somFindClass,
</B>except that it takes an additional (final) argument-the name of the
library file containing the class.  The<B> somFindClsInFile</B> method is
useful when a class is packaged in a DLL along with other classes and the
"dllname" class modifier has not been given in the class's IDL specification.

<P>
<B>Warning:</B>  On AIX, the<B> somFindClass</B> and<B> somFindClsInFile
</B>methods should<I> not</I>  be used to create a class whose implementation
is statically linked with the client program. Instead, the class object
should be created using the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B> procedure
provided by the class's .h/.xh header file. Static linkage is not created
by including usage bindings in a program, but by use of the offset-resolution
method-invocation macros.
<P>
<B>Invoking methods without corresponding class usage bindings</B>
<P>
This topic builds on the preceding discussion, and illustrates how a client
program can apply dynamic SOM mechanisms to utilize classes and objects
for which specific usage bindings are not available. This process can be
applied when a class implementor did not ship the C/C++ language bindings.
Furthermore, the process allows more programming flexibility, because it
is not necessary to<!-- entering slot 66 --> know the class and method names
at compile time in order to access them at run time. (At run time, however,
you must be able to provide the method arguments, either explicitly or via
a<B> va_list</B>, and provide a generalized way to handle return values.)
As an example application, a programmer might create an online class viewer
that can access many classes without requiring usage bindings for all those
classes, and the person using the viewer can select class names at run time.

<P>
As another aspect of flexibility, a code sequence similar to the following
C++ example could be re-used to access any class or method. After getting
the<B> somId</B> for a class name, the example uses the<B> somFindClass
</B>method to create the class object. The<B> somNew</B> method is then
invoked to create an instance of the specified class, and the<B> somDispatch
</B>method is used to invoke a method on the object.
