<H1>Using the IDL basic type 'any'</H1><!-- entering slot 380 -->
<P>
Some Interface Repository methods and<B> TypeCode</B> functions return information
typed as the IDL basic type<B> any</B>. Usually this is done when a wide
variety of different types of data may need to be returned through a common
interface. The type<B> any</B> actually consists of a structure with two
fields: a<B> _type</B> field and a<B> _value</B> field. The<B> _value</B> field
is a pointer to the actual datum that was returned, while the<B> _type</B> field
holds a<B> TypeCode</B>  that describes the datum.
<P>
In many cases, the context in which an operation occurs makes the type of
the datum apparent.<B></B> If so, there is no need to examine the<B> TypeCode
</B>unless it is simply as a consistency check. For example, when accessing
the first parameter of a<B> tk_struct TypeCode</B>, the type of the result
will always be the name of the structure (a string). Because this is known
ahead of time, there is no need to examine the returned<B> TypeCode</B> in
the<B> any_type</B> field to verify that it is a<B> tk_string TypeCode</B>.
You can just rely on the fact that it is a string; or, you can check the
<B>TypeCode</B> in the<B> _type</B> field to verify it, if you so choose.

<P>
An IDL<B> any</B> type can be used in an interface as a way of bypassing
the strong type checking that occurs in languages like ANSI C and C++. Your
compiler can only check that the interface returns the<B> any</B> structure;
it has no way of knowing what type of data will be carried by the<B> any
</B>during execution of the program. Consequently, in order to write C or
C++ code that accesses the contents of the<B> any</B> correctly, you must
always cast the<B> _value</B> field to reflect the actual type of the datum
at the time of the access.
<P>
Here is an example of a code fragment written in C that illustrates how
the casting must be done to extract various values from an<B> any</B>:
<PRE>#include &lt;som.h&gt;    /* For "any" &amp; "Environment" typedefs */
#include &lt;somtc.h&gt;  /* For TypeCode_kind prototype        */

any result;
Environment *ev;

printf ("result._value = ");
switch (TypeCode_kind (result._type, ev)) {

    case tk_string:
        printf ("%s\n", *((string *) result._value));
        break;

    case tk_long:
        printf ("%ld\n", *((long *) result._value));
        break;

    case tk_boolean:
        printf ("%d\n", *((boolean *) result._value));
        break;

    case tk_float:
        printf ("%f\n", *((float *) result._value));
        break;

    case tk_double:
        printf ("%f\n", *((double *) result._value));
        break;

    default:
        printf ("something else!\n");
}
</PRE>

<P>
Note: Of course, an<B> any</B> has no restriction, per se, on the type of
datum that it can carry. Frequently, however, methods that return an<B> any
</B>or that accept an<B> any</B> as an argument do place semantic restrictions
on the actual type of data they can accept or return. Always consult the
reference page for a method that uses an<B> any</B> to determine whether
it limits the range of types that may be acceptable.
