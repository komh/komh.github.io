<H1>The 'SOMMTraced' Metaclass</H1><!-- entering slot 388 -->
<P>
<B>SOMMTraced</B> is a metaclass that facilitates tracing of method invocations.
If class "Collie" is an instance of<B> SOMMTraced</B> (if<B> SOMMTraced
</B>is the metaclass of "Collie"), any method invoked on an instance of
"Collie" is traced. That is, before the method begins execution, a message
prints (to standard output) giving the actual parameters. Then, after the
method completes execution, a second message prints giving the returned
value. This behavior is attained merely by being an instance of the<B> SOMMTraced
</B>metaclass.
<P>
If the class being traced is contained in the Interface Repository, actual
parameters are printed as part of the trace. If the class is not contained
in the Interface Repository, an ellipsis is printed.
<P>
To be more concrete, suppose that the class "Collie" is a child of "Dog"
and is an instance of<B> SOMMTraced.</B> Because<B> SOMMTraced</B> is the
metaclass of "Collie," any method invoked on "Lassie" (an instance of "Collie")
is traced.
<P>
It is easy to use<B> SOMMTraced:</B> Just make a class an instance of<B> SOMMTraced
</B>in order to get tracing.
<P>
There is one more step for using<B> SOMMTraced:</B> Nothing prints unless
the environment variable SOMM_TRACED is set. If it is set to the empty string,
all  traced classes print. If SOMM_TRACED is not the empty string, it should
be set to the list of names of classes that should be traced. For example,
the following command turns on printing of the trace for "Collie", but not
for any other traced class:
<PRE>export  SOMM_TRACED=Collie      (on AIX)
SET     SOMM_TRACED=Collie      (on OS/2 or Windows)
</PRE>

<P>
The example below shows the IDL needed to create a traced dog class: Just
run the appropriate emitter to get an implementation binding.
<P>
<B>SOM IDL for 'TracedDog' class</B>
<PRE>#include "dog.idl"
#include &lt;somtrcls.idl&gt;
interface TracedDog : Dog
{
#ifdef __SOMIDL__
implementation
{
  //# Class Modifiers
  filestem = trdog;
  metaclass = SOMMTraced;
};
#endif /* __SOMIDL__ */
};
