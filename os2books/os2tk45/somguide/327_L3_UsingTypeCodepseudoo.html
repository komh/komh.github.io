<H1>Using TypeCode pseudo-objects</H1><!-- entering slot 375 -->
<P>
Much of the detailed information contained in Interface Repository objects
is represented in the form of<B> TypeCode</B>s.<B> TypeCode</B>s are complex
data structures whose actual representation is hidden. A<B> TypeCode</B> is
an architected way of describing in complete detail everything that is known
about a particular data type in the IDL language, regardless of whether
it is a (built-in)<I> basic</I> type or a  (user-defined)<I> aggregate</I>
type.
<P>
Conceptually, every<B> TypeCode</B> contains a "kind" field (which classifies
it), and one or more parameters that carry descriptive information appropriate
for that particular category of<B> TypeCode</B>. For example, if the data
type is<B> long</B>, its<B> TypeCode</B> would contain a "kind" field with
the value<B> tk_long</B>. No additional parameters are needed to completely
describe this particular data type, since<B> long</B> is a basic type in
the IDL language.
<P>
By contrast, if the<B> TypeCode</B> describes an IDL<B> struct</B>, its
"kind" field would contain the value<B> tk_struct</B>, and it would possess
the following parameters: a string giving the name of the struct, and two
additional parameters for each member of the struct: a string giving the
member name and another (inner)<B> TypeCode</B> representing the member's
type. This example illustrates the fact that<B> TypeCode</B>s can be nested
and arbitrarily complex, as appropriate to express the type of data they
describe. Thus, a structure that has N members will have a<B> TypeCode</B> of
<B>tk_struct</B> with 2N+1 parameters (a name and<B> TypeCode</B> parameter
for each member, plus a name for the struct itself).
<P>
A<B> tk_union TypeCode</B> representing a union with N members has 3N+2
parameters: the type name of the union, the<B> switch TypeCode</B>, and
a label value, member name and associated<B> TypeCode</B> for each member.
(The label values all have the same type as the switch, except that the
default member, if present, has a label value of zero<B> octet.)</B>
<P>
A<B> tk_enum TypeCode</B>  (which represents an enum) has  N+1 parameters:
the name of the enum followed by a string for each enumeration identifier.
A<B> tk_string TypeCode</B> has a single parameter: the maximum string length,
as an integer. (A maximum length of zero signifies an unbounded string.)

<P>
A<B> tk_sequence TypeCode</B> has two parameters: a<B> TypeCode</B> for
the sequence elements, and the maximum size, as an integer.  (Again, zero
signifies unbounded.)
<P>
A<B> tk_array TypeCode</B> has two parameters: a<B> TypeCode</B> for the
array elements, and the array length, as an integer. (Arrays must be bounded.)

<P>
The<B> tk_objref TypeCode</B> represents an object reference; its parameter
is a repository ID that identifies its interface.
<P>
A complete table showing the parameters of all possible<B> TypeCodes</B> is
given in the SOMobjects Base Toolkit Programmers Reference Manual; see the
<B>TypeCode_kind</B> function of the Interface Repository Framework.
<P>
<B>TypeCode</B>s are not actually "objects" in the formal sense.<B> TypeCode</B>s
are referred to in the CORBA standard as<I> pseudo-objects</I> and described
as "opaque". This means that, in reality,<B> TypeCode</B>s are special data
structures whose precise definition is not fully exposed. Their implementation
can vary from one platform to another, but all implementations must exhibit
a minimal set of architected behavior. SOM<B> TypeCode</B>s support the
architected behavior and have additional capability as well (for example,
they can be copied and freed).
<P>
Although<B> TypeCode</B>s are not objects, the programming interfaces that
support them adhere to the same conventions used for IDL method invocations
in SOM. That is, the first argument is always a<B> TypeCode</B> pseudo-object,
and the second argument is a pointer to an<B> Environment</B> structure.
Similarly, the names of the<B> TypeCode</B> functions are constructed like
SOM's C-language method-invocation macros (all functions that operate<!-- entering slot 376 --> on
<B>TypeCode</B>s are named<B> TypeCode</B>_&lt;<I>function-name</I>&gt;).
Because of this ostensible similarity to an IDL class, the<B> TypeCode</B> programming
interfaces can be conveniently defined in IDL as shown below.
<P>
A complete table showing the parameters of all possible<B>  TypeCodes</B> is
given in the<I> SOMobjects Developer Toolkit Programmers Reference Manual;
</I>see the<B> TypeCode_kind</B> function of the Interface Repository Framework.

<PRE>interface TypeCode {

enum TCKind {
    tk_null, tk_void,
    tk_short, tk_long, tk_ushort, tk_ulong,
    tk_float, tk_double, tk_boolean, tk_char,
    tk_octet, tk_any, tk_TypeCode, tk_Principal, tk_objref,
    tk_struct, tk_union, tk_enum, tk_string,
    tk_sequence, tk_array,

    // The remaining enumerators are SOM-unique extensions
    // to the CORBA standard.
    //
    tk_pointer, tk_self, tk_foreign
};

exception Bounds {};
// This exception is returned if an attempt is made
// by the parameter() operation (described below) to
// access more parameters than exist in the receiving
// TypeCode.

boolean equal (in TypeCode tc);
// Compares the argument with the receiver and returns TRUE
// if both TypeCodes are equivalent.  This is NOT a test for
// identity.

TCKind kind ();
// Returns the type of the receiver as a TCKind.

long param_count ();
// Returns the number of parameters that make up the
// receiving TypeCode.

any parameter (in long index) raises (Bounds);
// Returns the indexed parameter from the receiving TypeCode.
// Parameters are indexed from 0 to param_count()-1.
//
//  The remaining operations are SOM-unique extensions.
//

short alignment ();
// This operation returns the alignment required for an instance
// of the type described by the receiving TypeCode.

TypeCode copy (in TypeCode tc);
// This operation returns a copy of the receiving TypeCode.

void free (in TypeCode tc);
// This operation frees the memory associated with the
// receiving TypeCode. Subsequently, no further use can be
// made of the receiver, which, in effect, ceases to exist.

void print (in TypeCode tc);
// This operation writes a readable representation of the
// receiving TypeCode to stdout.  Useful for examining
// TypeCodes when debugging.

void setAlignment (in short align);
// This operation overrides the required alignment for an
// instance of the type described by the receiving TypeCode.

long size (in TypeCode tc);
// This operation returns the size of an instance of the
// type represented by the receiving TypeCode.
