<P>
<B>Distributed SOM</B>  (or<B> DSOM</B>) allows application programs to
access SOM objects across address spaces.. That is, application programs
can access objects in other processes, even on different machines.  DSOM
provides this transparent access to remote objects through its Object Request
Broker (ORB): the location and implementation of the object are hidden from
the client, and the client accesses the object as if local.  The current
release of DSOM supports distribution of objects among processes within
a workstation, and across a local area network consisting of OS/2 system,
AIX systems, or a mix of both. Future releases may support larger enterprise-wide
networks.
