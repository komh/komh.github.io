<H1>Run-time environment initialization</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>
When the SOM run-time environment is initialized, four primitive SOM objects
are automatically created. Three of these are class objects (<B>SOMObject</B>,
<B>SOMClass</B>, and<B> SOMClassMgr</B>), and one is an instance of<B> SOMClassMgr</B>,
called the<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>. Once loaded, application programs can
invoke methods on these class objects to perform tasks such as creating
other objects, printing the contents of an object, freeing objects, and
the like. These four primitive objects are discussed below.
<P>
In addition to creating the four primitive SOM objects, initialization of
the SOM run-time environment also involves initializing global variables
to hold data structures that maintain the state of the environment.  Other
functions in the SOM run-time library rely on these global variables.
<P>
For application programs written in C or C++ that use the language-specific
bindings provided by SOM, the SOM run-time environment is automatically
initialized the first time any object is created.  Programmers using other
languages must initialize the run-time environment explicitly by calling
the<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function (provided by the SOM run-time library)
before using any other SOM functions or methods.
