<H1>Initializing a client program</H1><!-- entering slot 243 -->
<P>
A client application must declare and initialize the DSOM run time before
attempting to create or access a remote object. The<B> SOMD_Init</B> procedure
initializes all of the DSOM run time, including the <B> SOMDObjectMgr</B> object.
The global variable,<B> SOMD_ObjectMgr</B> is initialized to point to the
local DSOM Object Manager.
<P>
A client application must also initialize all application classes used by
the program. For each class, the corresponding<I> &lt;className&gt;</I><B>NewClass
</B>call should be made.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In non-distributed SOM programs, the<I> &lt;className&gt;</I><B>New
</B>macro (and the new operator provided for each class by the SOM C++ bindings)
implicitly calls the procedure<I> &lt;className&gt;</I><B>NewClass</B> when
creating a new object. This is not currently possible in DSOM because, when
creating remote objects, DSOM uses a generic method that is not class-specific.

<P>

<P>
This was shown in the "Stack" example in section 6.2. In a similar example
of an application that uses "Car" and "Driver" objects, the initialization
code might look like this:
<PRE>#include &lt;somd.h&gt;    /* needed by all clients */
#include &lt;Car.h&gt;     /* needed to access remote Car */
#include &lt;Driver.h&gt;  /* needed to access remote Driver */

main()
{
    Environment ev; /* ev used for error passing */
    SOM_InitEnvironment(&amp;ev);

    /* Do DSOM initialization */
    SOMD_Init(&amp;ev);

    /* Initialize application classes */
    CarNewClass(Car_MajorVersion, Car_MinorVersion);
    DriverNewClass(Driver_MajorVersion, Driver_MinorVersion);
    ...
}

</PRE>

<P>
As shown, client programs should include the "somd.h" file (or, for C++
programs, the "somd.xh" file) in order to define the DSOM run#time interfaces.

<P>
Note also that, since<B> Environments</B> are used for passing error results
between a method and its caller, an<B> Environment</B> variable (<I>ev</I>)
must be declared and initialized for this purpose.
<P>
The calls to "CarNewClass" and "DriverNewClass" are required if the client
will be creating or accessing Cars and Drivers. The procedures "CarNewClass"
and "DriverNewClass" create class objects for the classes "Car" and "Driver".
When a DSOM Object Manager method like<B> somdNewObject</B> is invoked to
create a "Car", it expects the "Car" class object to exist. If the class
does not yet exist, the "ClassNotFound" exception will be returned.
