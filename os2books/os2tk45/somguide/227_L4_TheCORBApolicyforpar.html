<H1>The CORBA policy for parameter memory management</H1><!-- entering slot 264 -->
<P>
When a class contains the SOM IDL modifier<B> memory_management = corba,
</B>this signifies that all methods introduced by the class follow the CORBA
specification for parameter memory management, except where a particular
method has an explicit modifier<B> (object_owns_result</B> or<B> object_owns_parameters)
</B>that indicates otherwise. The remainder of this section describes the
CORBA specification for parameter memory management.
<P>
<B>Caller frees parameters and return results</B>
<P>
The CORBA memory-management policy specifies that the caller of a method
is responsible for freeing all parameters and the return result after the
method call is complete. This applies regardless of whether the parameter
was allocated by the caller or the object (or, in the case of a remote method
call, by DSOM). In other words, the CORBA policy asserts that parameters
are uniformly "caller-owned".
<P>
<B>Allocation responsibilities</B>
<P>
Whether the parameter or return result should be allocated by the caller
or by the object depends on the type  of the parameter and its mode  ("in",
"inout", "out", or "return").  In general, the caller is responsible for
allocating storage for most parameters and return results. More specifically,
CORBA requires that storage for all "in" arguments, for all "inout" or "out"
arguments, and for all "return" results must be provided by the client program,
with certain exceptions as itemized below.
<P>
The object is responsible for allocating storage as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for<B> strings</B> when used as "out" arguments or
as "return" results<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for the "_buffer" field of<B> sequences</B> when used
as "out" arguments or as "return" results,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for the "_value" field of<B> anys</B> when used as
"inout" or "out" arguments or as "return" results,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for<B> pointer</B> types when used as "inout" or "out"
arguments or as "return" results,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for<B> arrays</B> when used as "return" results, and
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->for objects when used as "inout" or "out" arguments
or as "return" results.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For "inout"<B> strings</B> and<B> sequences</B>, the "out"
result is constrained to be no larger than the size of the "in" argument
allocated by the client.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
Ownership of memory allocated in the above cases becomes the responsibility
of the client program. For remote method calls, when a remote object allocates
memory for a parameter or "return" value, DSOM subsequently allocates memory
in the client's address space for the parameter or result. For a parameter/result
that is an object (rather than a block of memory) DSOM automatically creates
an object reference (a proxy object) in the client's address space. In each
case, the memory or the proxy object becomes the responsibility of the client
program and should later be freed by the client, using<B> ORBfree</B> for
blocks of memory or<B> release</B> for proxy objects.
