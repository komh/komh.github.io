<H1>Peer vs. client/server processes</H1><!-- entering slot 338 -->
<P>
The client/server model of distributed computing is appropriate when it
is convenient (or necessary) to centralize the implementation and management
of a set of shared objects in one or more servers. However, some applications
require more flexibility in the distribution of objects among processes.
Specifically, it is often useful to allow processes to manage and export
some of their objects, as well as access remote objects owned by other processes.
In these cases, the application processes do not adhere to a strict client/server
relationship; instead, they cooperate as "peers", behaving both as clients
and as servers.
<P>
Peer applications must be written to respond to incoming asynchronous requests,
in addition to performing their normal processing. In a multi-threaded system
(like OS/2), this is best accomplished by dedicating a separate process
thread that handles DSOM communications and dispatching. In systems that
do not currently support multi-threading (like AIX), peer applications must
be structured as event-driven programs.
