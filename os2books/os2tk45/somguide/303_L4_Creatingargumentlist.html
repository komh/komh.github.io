<H1>Creating argument lists</H1><!-- entering slot 346 -->
<P>
A very important use of the<B> NVList</B> is to pass the argument list for
an operation when creating a request. CORBA 1.1 specifies two methods, defined
in the<B> ORB</B> class, to build an argument list:<B> create_list</B> and
<B>create_operation_list.</B> The IDL prototypes for these methods are as
follows:
<PRE>ORBStatus <B>create_list</B>(
                        in  long        count,        /* # of items */
                        out NVList      new_list );

ORBStatus <B>create_operation_list</B>(
                        in  OperationDef oper,
                        out NVList       new_list );
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> create_list</B> method returns an<B> NVList</B> with the specified
number of elements. Each of the elements is empty. It is the client's responsibility
to fill the elements in the list with the correct information using the
<B>set_item</B> method. Elements in the<B> NVList</B> must contain the arguments
in the same order as they were defined for the operation. Elements are numbered
from 0 to count-1.
<P>
The<B> create_operation_list</B> method returns an<B> NVList</B> initialized
with the argument descriptions for a given operation (specified by the<B> OperationDef</B>).
The arguments are returned in the same order as they were defined for the
operation. The client only needs to fill in the<I> item_value</I> and<I> value_len
</I>in the elemens of the<B> NVList.</B>
<P>
In addition to these CORBA-defined methods, DSOM provides a third version,
defined in the<B> SOMDObject</B> class. The IDL prototype for this method
is as follows:
<PRE>
ORBStatus <B>create_request_args</B>(
                        in Identifier operation,
                        out <B>NVList</B> arg_list,
                        out NamedValue result );
</PRE>

<P>
Like<B> create_operation_list,</B> the<B> create_request_args</B> method
creates the appropriate<B> NVList</B> for the specified operation.  In addition,
<B>create_request_args</B> initializes the<B> NamedValue</B> that will hold
the result with the expected return type. The<B> create_request_args</B> method
is defined as a companion to the<B> create_request</B> method, and has the
advantage that the<B> InterfaceDef</B> for the operation does not have to
be retrieved from the Interface Repository.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<B> create_request_args</B> method is not  defined in CORBA
1.1. Hence, the<B> create_operation_list</B> method, defined on the<B> ORB
</B>class, should be used instead when writing portable CORBA-compliant
programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
