<H1>Server object</H1><!-- entering slot 272 -->
<P>
Each server process contains a single<I> server object</I>, which has the
following responsibilities for managing objects in the server:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides an interface to<I> client applications</I> for
basic object creation and destruction services, as well as any other application-specific
object-management services that may be required by clients. For example,
a print server may have a method that returns a list of all printers managed
by that server. Clients may call this method to find out what printers are
available.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides an interface to the<I> SOM Object Adapter
</I>for support in the creation and management of DSOM object references
(which are used identify an object in the server), and for dispatching requests.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The server class,<B> SOMDServer,</B> defines the base
interface that<I> must</I> be supported by any server object. In addition,
<B>SOMDServer</B> provides a default implementation that is suited to managing
transient SOM objects in a server. This section will show how an application
might override the basic<B> SOMDServer</B> methods and introduce new methods
in order to tailor the server object functionality to a particular application.
