<H1>New restrictions and deprecated methods</H1><!-- entering slot 17 -->
<P>
While implementing the Metaclass Framework, IBM learned that metaclasses
must be programmed so that the capabilities they implement will be preserved
when various metaclasses are combined (using multiple inheritance) into
a SOM-derived metaclass. To assure this result, the Metaclass Framework
metaclasses have been programmed using a "Cooperative Metaclass." However,
IBM is not yet ready to include the Cooperative metaclass among the officially
supported features of SOMobjects.
<P>
To prevent user-defined metaclasses from interfering with the operation
of the Cooperative Metaclass and consequently with the Metaclass Framework,
SOMobjects programmers are strongly urged to observe the following restriction
when programming new metaclasses:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->User-defined metaclasses can introduce new class methods
and class variables, but should not override any of the methods introduced
by the<B> SOMClass</B> class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
SOMobjects users whose metaclass programming requirements cannot be met
within the above restrictions will be given access to the Cooperative Metaclass
and its documentation. Note, however, that metaclasses developed using the
Cooperative Metaclass may require reprogramming when an officially supported
Cooperative Metaclass is later introduced.
<P>
In addition, use of a number of (public) methods introduced by<B> SOMClass
</B>is now deprecated because they are useful only from overridden<B> SOMClass
</B>methods. These methods are listed under the heading "Deprecated methods"
in the documentation for<B> SOMClass</B> within the SOMobjects Base Toolkit
Programmers Reference Manual, until such time as SOMobjects is ready to
officially provide a framework within which their use will not interfere
with the internal operation of SOMobjects itself.
