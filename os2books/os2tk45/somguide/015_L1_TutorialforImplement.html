<P>
This tutorial contains five examples showing how SOM classes can be implemented
to achieve various functionality. Obviously, for any person who wishes to
become a class implementor, this tutorial is essential. However, even for
those programmers who expect only to<I> use</I> SOM classes that were implemented
by others, the tutorial is also necessary, as it presents several concepts
that will help clarify the process of using SOM classes.
