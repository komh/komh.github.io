<H1>Setting environment variables</H1><!-- entering slot 235 -->
<P>
Several environment variables are used by SOM and DSOM. These variables
need to be set before registering the DSOM application in the Interface
and Implementation Repositories.
<P>
For this example, the following environment variables could be set as shown.
A full description of the environment variables and how to set them is given
in section 6.6, "Configuring DSOM."
<P>
On AIX (in the syntax of the default shell, /bin/ksh):
<PRE>export HOSTNAME=machine3
export SOMIR=$SOMBASE/etc/som.ir:/u/myuserid/my.ir
export SOMDDIR=/u/myuserid/somddir
export LIBPATH=$LIBPATH:$SOMBASE/lib:/u/myuserid/lib
</PRE>

<P>
On OS/2:
<PRE>set USER=pat
set HOSTNAME=machine3
set SOMDDIR=c:\somddir

rem *** The following variables are set in CONFIG.SYS by
rem *** the install program on OS/2, assuming "c:\som" is the
rem *** value of %SOMBASE% supplied by the user.
set SOMIR=c:\som\etc\som.ir;som.ir
set LIBPATH=.;c:\som\lib;&lt;previous LIBPATH&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
On Windows:
<PRE>set USER=pat
set HOSTNAME=machine3
set SOMDDIR=c:\somddir
rem *** The following variables are usually set in AUTOEXEC.BAT
rem *** by the install program on Windows, assuming "c:\som"
rem *** is the value of %SOMBASE% supplied by the user.
set SOMIR=c:\som\etc\som.ir:som.ir
set PATH=.;c:\som\lib;&lt;previous PATH&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
USER identifies the user of a DSOM client application. DSOM sends the USER
ID with every remote method call, in case the remote object wishes to perform
any access control checking. This is discussed later in the section "Basic
Server Programming." (Note that USER is usually set automatically by AIX
when a user logs in.)
<P>
HOSTNAME identifies the name of each machine running DSOM.
<P>
SOMIR gives a list of files that together constitute the Interface Repository.
The IR is used by DSOM to guide the construction and interpretation of request
messages. For DSOM, it is preferable to use full pathnames in the list of
IR files, since the IR will be shared by several programs that may not all
reside in the same directory.
<P>
SOMDDIR gives the name of a directory used to store DSOM configuration files,
including the Implementation Repository.
<P>
LIBPATH (on AIX and OS/2) or PATH (on Windows) gives a list of directories
where DLLs can be found.
<P>
