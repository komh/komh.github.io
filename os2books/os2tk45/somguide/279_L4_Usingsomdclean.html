<H1>Using 'somdclean'</H1><!-- entering slot 320 -->
<P>
As the first alternative, a DSOM kernel extension can be set up, which automatically
frees the system resources used by DSOM when a process exits. The<B> somdclean
</B>command is issued to load, unload or query a DSOM kernel extension,
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
somdclean -l<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> Loads the kernel extension<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>somdclean -u<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> Unloads the kernel extension<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>somdclean<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> Queries the current state of the
kernel extension<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> somdclean</B> command can only be executed by a privileged user.
Hence, you must execute this command as "root".
<P>
The kernel extension is only aware of DSOM processes started<I> after</I> it
has been loaded. That is, if a DSOM process is started before the kernel
extension is loaded, the resources associated with the existing process
will<I> not</I> be freed.
<P>
Before you unload the kernel extension, verify that there are no active
DSOM processes. If the kernel extension is unloaded while DSOM is using
it, the system will crash.
