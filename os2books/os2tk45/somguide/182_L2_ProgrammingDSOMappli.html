<H1>Programming DSOM applications</H1><!-- entering slot 218 -->
<P>
All DSOM applications involve three kinds of programming:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Client programming:  writing code that uses objects;
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Server programming:  writing code that implements
and manages objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Implementing classes:  writing code that implements
objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Three sections ("Basic Client Programming", "Basic Server Programming",
and Implementing Classes") describe how to create DSOM applications from
these three points of view. In turn, the structure and services of the relevant
DSOM run-time environment are explained.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The three sections are presented in the order above to aid
in their explanation. However, the actual programming tasks are likely to
be performed in the opposite order.
<P>
Additional examples are provided in these sections to illustrate DSOM services.
