<P>
The Event Management Framework consists of an Event Manager (EMan) class,
a Registration Data class and several Event classes. It provides a way to
organize various application events into groups and to process all events
in a single event-processing loop. The need for this kind of facility is
seen very clearly in interactive applications that also need to process
some background events (say, messages arriving from a remote process). Such
applications must maintain contact with the user while responding to events
coming from other sources.
<P>
One solution in a multi-threaded environment is to have a different thread
service each different source of events. For a single-threaded environment
it should be possible to recognize and process all events of interest in
a single main loop. EMan offers precisely this capability. EMan can be useful
even when multiple threads are available, because of its simple programming
model. It avoids contention for common data objects between EMan event processing
and other main-loop processing activity.
