<H1>Multi-threaded DSOM programs</H1><!-- entering slot 339 -->
<P>
In a system that supports multi-threading, like OS/2, the easiest way to
write a peer DSOM program is to dedicate a separate thread to perform the
usual "server" processing. This body of this thread would contain the same
code as the simple servers described in section 6.4, "Basic Server Programming."

<PRE>DSOM_thread(void *params)
{
   Environment ev;
   SOM_InitEnvironment(&amp;ev);

/* Initialize the DSOM run-time environment */
   SOMD_Init(&amp;ev);

/* Retrieve its ImplementationDef from the Implementation
   Repository by passing its implementation ID as a key */
   SOMD_ImplDefObject =
      _find_impldef(SOMD_ImplRepObject, &amp;ev, *(ImplId *)params);

/* Create SOM Object Adapter and begin executing requests */
   SOMD_SOMOAObject = SOMOANew();
   _impl_is_ready(SOMD_SOMOAObject, &amp;ev, SOMD_ImplDefObject);
   _execute_request_loop(SOMD_SOMOAObject, &amp;ev, SOMD_WAIT);
}
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The DSOM run time is "thread safe"; that is, DSOM protects
its own  data structures and objects from race conditions and update conflicts.
However, it is the application's responsibility to implement its own concurrency
control for concurrent thread access to local shared application objects.
