<H1>Template types (sequences and strings)</H1><!-- entering slot 100 -->
<P>
IDL defines two template types not found in C and C++:<B> sequences</B> and
<B>strings</B>. A<B> sequence</B> is a one-dimensional array with two characteristics:
 a maximum size (specified at compile time) and a length (determined at
run time).<B> Sequences</B> permit passing unbounded arrays between objects.
<B>Sequences</B> are specified as follows:
<P>
<B>sequence &lt;</B><I> simple-type</I> [<B>,</B><I> positive-integer-const</I>]
<B>&gt;</B>
<P>
where "simple-type" specifies any valid IDL type, and the optional "positive-integer-const"
is a constant expression that specifies the maximum size of the<B> sequence
</B>(as a positive integer).
<P>
Note: The "simple-type" cannot have a '*' directly in the sequence statement.
Instead, a typedef for the pointer type must be used. For example, instead
of:
<PRE>   typedef sequence&lt;long *&gt; seq_longptr; // Error: '*' not allowed.
</PRE>

<P>
use:
<PRE>   typedef long * longptr;
   typedef sequence&lt;longptr&gt; seq_longptr;  // Ok.
</PRE>

<P>
In SOM's C and C++ bindings,<B> sequences</B>  are mapped onto<B> structs
</B>with the following members:
<P>
<B>unsigned long _maximum;</B>
<BR>
<B>unsigned long _length;</B>
<BR>
<I>simple-type</I><B> *_buffer;</B>
<P>
where "simple-type" is the specified type of the<B> sequence</B>.  For example,
the IDL declaration
<PRE>   typedef sequence&lt;long, 10&gt; vec10;
</PRE>

<P>
results in the following C<B> struct</B>:
<PRE>   #ifndef _IDL_SEQUENCE_long_defined
   #define _IDL_SEQUENCE_long_defined
   typedef struct {
       unsigned long _maximum;
       unsigned long _length;
       long *_buffer;
   } _IDL_SEQUENCE_long;
   #endif /* _IDL_SEQUENCE_long_defined */
   typedef _IDL_SEQUENCE_long vec10;
</PRE>

<P>
and an instance of this type is declared as follows:
<PRE>   vec10 v = {10L, 0L, (long *)NULL};
</PRE>

<P>
The "_maximum" member designates the actual size of storage allocated for
the<B> sequence</B>, and the "_length" member designates the number of values
contained in the "_buffer" member. For bounded<B> sequences</B>, it is an
error to set the "_length" or "_maximum" member to a value larger than the
specified bound of the<B> sequence</B>.
<P>
Before a<B> sequence</B> is passed as the value of an "in" or "inout" method
parameter, the "_buffer" member must point to an array of elements of the
appropriate type, and the "_length" member must contain the number of elements
to be passed. (If the parameter is "inout" and the<B> sequence</B> is unbounded,
the "_maximum" member must also be set to the actual size of the array.
Upon return, "_length" will contain the number of values copied into "_buffer",
which must be less than "_maximum".) When a<B> sequence</B> is passed as
an "out" method parameter or received as the return value, the method procedure
allocates storage for "_buffer" as needed, the "_length" member contains
the number of elements returned, and the "_maximum" member contains the
number of elements allocated. (The client is responsible for subsequently
freeing the memory pointed to by  "_buffer".)
<P>
C and C++ programs using SOM's language bindings can refer to<B> sequence
</B>types as:
<P>
<B>_IDL_SEQUENCE_</B><I>type</I>
<P>
where "type" is the effective type of the<B> sequence</B> members. For example,
the IDL type sequence&lt;long,10&gt; is referred to in a C/C++ program by
the type name _IDL_SEQUENCE_long. If longint is defined via a typedef to
be type long, then the IDL type sequence&lt;longint,10&gt; is also referred
to by the type name _IDL_SEQUENCE_long.
<P>
If the typedef is for a pointer type, then the effective type is the name
of the pointer type. For example, the following statements define a C/C++
type _IDL_SEQUENCE_longptr and<I> not</I> _IDL_SEQUENCE_long:
<PRE>   typedef long * longptr;
   typedef sequence&lt;longptr&gt; seq_longptr;
</PRE>

<P>
A string is similar to a<B> sequence</B> of type<B> char.</B> It can contain
all possible 8-bit quantities except NULL.<B> Strings</B> are specified
as follows:
<P>
<B>string  [</B> &lt;<I> positive-integer-const</I> &gt;<B> ]</B>
<P>
where the optional "positive-integer-const" is a constant expression that
specifies the maximum size of the<B> string</B> (as a positive integer,
which does not include the extra byte to hold a NULL as required in C/C++).
In SOM's C and C++ bindings,<B> strings</B> are mapped onto zero-byte terminated
character arrays. The length of the string is encoded by the position of
the zero-byte. For example, the following IDL declaration:
<PRE>   typedef string&lt;10&gt; foo;
</PRE>

<P>
is converted to the following C/C++<B> typedef</B>:
<PRE>   typedef char *foo;
</PRE>

<P>
A variable of this type is then declared as follows:
<PRE>   foo s = (char *) NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
C and C++ programs using SOM's language bindings can refer to<B> string
</B>types by the type name<I> string</I>.
<P>
When an unbounded<B> string</B> is passed as the value of an "inout" method
parameter, the returned value is constrained to be no longer than the input
value. Hence, using unbounded<B> string</B>s as "inout" parameters is not
advised.
