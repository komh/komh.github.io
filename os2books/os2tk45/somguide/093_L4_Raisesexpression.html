<P>
The optional<B> raises</B> expression ("raises-expr") in a method declaration
indicates which exceptions the method may raise. (IDL exceptions are implemented
by simply passing back error information after a method call, as opposed
to the "catch/throw" model where an exception is implemented by a long jump
or signal.)  A<B> raises</B> expression is specified as follows:
<P>
<B>raises (</B><I> identifier1, identifier2,</I>...<B> )</B>
<P>
where each "identifier" is the name of a previously defined<B> exception</B>.
In addition to the exceptions listed in the<B> raises</B> expression, a
method may also signal any of the standard exceptions. Standard exceptions,
however, should not appear in a<B> raises</B> expression. If no<B> raises
</B>expression is given, then a method can raise only the standard exceptions.
(See the earlier topic "Exception declarations" for information on defining
exceptions and for the list of standard exceptions. See Chapter 3, the section
entitled "Exceptions and error handling," for information on using exceptions.)
