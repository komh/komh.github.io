<P>
It is sometimes necessary to create a class object before creating any instances
of the class. For example, creating instances using the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;
<B>Renew</B> macro or the<B> somRenew</B> method requires knowing how large
the created instance will be, so that memory can be allocated for it. Getting
this information requires creating the class object (see the example under
"Creating instances of a class" early in this chapter). As another example,
a class object must be explicitly created when a program does not use the
SOM bindings for a class. Without SOM bindings for a class, its instances
must be created using<B> somNew</B> or<B> somRenew</B>, and these methods
require that the class object be created in advance.
<P>
Use the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass</B> procedure to create a class
object:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When using the C/C++ language bindings for the class,
and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the name of the class is known at compile time.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
