<P>
This book is a subset of the<I> SOMobjects Developer Toolkit Users Guide
</I>for the full-capability SOMobjects Developer Toolkit.  The omitted chapters
describe capabilities not included with the SOMobjects Base Toolkit.  Chapters
that are included appear in their entirety, as written for the full-capability
SOMobjects systems, except for some references to capabilities not included
in the SOMobjects Base Toolkit.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="003_L1_IntroducingtheSOMobj.html">Introducing
the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit</A> provides an overview of the major elements
of SOM.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="015_L1_TutorialforImplement.html">Tutorial
for Implementing SOM Classes</A> contains a Tutorial with five evolutionary
examples that illustrate techniques for implementing classes in SOM. All
readers should cover this tutorial.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="025_L1_UsingSOMClassesinCli.html">Using SOM
Classes in Client Programs</A> describes how an application program creates
instances of a SOM class, how it invokes methods, and so on. For readers
interested only in using SOM classes, rather than building them, chapters
2 and 3 may provide all of the information they need to begin using SOM
classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="069_L1_SOMIDLandtheSOMCompi.html">SOM IDL
and the SOM Compiler</A> contains explanations and examples for all valid
SOM IDL syntax components, it then presents the SOM Compiler, including
all compiler options and related environment variables.  All class implementors
will need to reference this chapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="118_L1_ImplementingClassesi.html">Implementing
Classes in SOM</A> provides more comprehensive information about the SOM
system itself, including operation of the SOM run-time environment, inheritance,
and method resolution.  This chapter also describes how to create language-neutral
class libraries using SOM.  In addition, it contains some advanced topics
for customizing SOM to better suit the needs of a particular application.
All class implementors will need to reference this chapter.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="176_L1_DistributedSOMDSOM.html">Distributed
SOM (DSOM)</A> describes Distributed SOM and how to use it to access objects
across address spaces, even on different machines. This chapter also describes
how to customize DSOM. Note that SOMobjects Base Toolkit supports only<I> Workstation
DSOM</I> (distribution among processes on a single machine), whereas SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit also supports<I> Workgroup DSOM</I> (distribution among
a network of machines).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="332_L1_TheMetaclassFramewor.html">Metaclass
Framework</A> describes the Metaclass Framework and some utility metaclasses
that SOM provides to assist users in deriving new classes with special abilities
to execute "before" and "after" operations when a method call occurs, as
well as other capabilities for modifying the default semantics of method
invocation and object creation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><A HREF="341_L1_TheEventManagementFr.html">Event Management
Framework</A> describes the Event Manager Framework, which allows grouping
of all application events and waiting on multiple events in one place. The
Event Manager is used by DSOM.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

Sockets Subclasses</A> describes how to subclass a "Sockets" class that
facilitates inter-process communications required by the DSOM, Replication,
and Event Management Frameworks.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
