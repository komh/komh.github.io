<H1>Offset resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 56 -->
<P>
To obtain a pointer to a procedure using<B> offset</B> resolution, the C/C++
usage bindings provide the<B> SOM_Resolve</B> and<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck
</B>macros. The usage bindings themselves use the first of these,<B> SOM_Resolve</B>,
for offset-resolution method calls. The difference in the two macros is
that the<B> SOM_Resolve</B> macro performs consistency checking on its arguments,
but the macro<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B>, which is faster, does not. Both
macros require the same arguments:
<P>
<B>SOM_Resolve</B>(&lt;<I>receiver</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt;)
<B>SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B>(&lt;<I>receiver</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;,
&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt;)
<P>
where the arguments are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<I>receiver</I><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> The object to which the method will
apply. It should be specified as an expression without side effects.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> className
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>The name of the class that introduces the method.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I>methodName</I><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> The name
of the desired method.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These two names (<I>className</I> and<I> methodName</I>) must be given as
tokens, rather than strings or expressions. (For example, as Animal rather
than "Animal".) If the symbol<B> SOM_TestOn</B> is defined and the symbol
<B>SOM_NoTest</B> is not defined in the current compilation unit, then<B> SOM_Resolve
</B>verifies that<I> receiver</I> is an instance of<I> className</I> or
some class derived from<I> className</I>. If this test fails, an error message
is output and execution is terminated.
<P>
The<B> SOM_Resolve</B> and<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B>  macros use the procedure
<B>somResolve</B> to obtain the entry-point address of the desired method
procedure (or raise a fatal error if<I> methodName</I> is not introduced
by<I> className)</I>. This result can be directly applied to the method
arguments, or stored in a variable of generic procedure type (for example,
<B>somMethodPtr</B>) and retained for later method use. This second possibility
would result in a loss of information, however, for the reasons now given.

<P>
The<B> SOM_Resolve</B> or<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B> macros are especially
useful because they cast the method procedure they obtain to the right type
to allow the C or C++ compiler to call  this procedure with<I> system linkage
</I>and with the appropriate arguments. This is why the result of<B> SOM_Resolve
</B>is immediately useful for calling the method procedure, and why storing
the result of<B> SOM_Resolve</B> in a variable of some "generic" procedure
type results in a loss of information. The correct type information can
be regained, however, because the type used by<B> SOM_Resolve</B> for casting
the result of<B> somResolve</B>  is available from C/C++ usage bindings
using the typedef name<B> somTD_</B>&lt;<I>className</I>&gt;_&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt;.
This type name describes a pointer to a method procedure for<I> methodName
</I>introduced by class<I> className</I>. If the final argument of the method
is a<B> va_list</B>, then the method procedure returned by<B> SOM_Resolve
</B>or<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B> must be called with a<B> va_list</B>  argument,
and not a variable number of arguments.
<P>
Below is a C example of using<B> SOM_Resolve</B> to obtain a method procedure
pointer for method "sayHello", introduced by class "Hello", and using it
to invoke the method on "obj." (Assume that the only argument required by
the "sayHello" method is the<B> Environment</B> pointer.)
<PRE>   somMethodProc *p;   SOMObject obj = HelloNew();
   p = SOM_Resolve(obj, Hello, sayHello);
   ((somTD_Hello_sayHello)p) (obj, somGetGlobalEnvironment());
</PRE>

<P>
<B>SOM_Resolve</B> and<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B> can only be used to obtain
method procedures for<I> static methods</I>  (methods that have been declared
in an IDL specification for a class) and not methods that are added to a
class at run time. See the<I> System Object Model Programming Reference
</I>for more information and examples on<B> SOM_Resolve</B> and<B> SOM_ResolveNoCheck</B>.
