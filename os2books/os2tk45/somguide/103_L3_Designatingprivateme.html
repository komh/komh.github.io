<H1>Designating 'private' methods and attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 126 -->
<P>
To designate methods or attributes within an IDL specification as "private,"
the declaration of the method or attribute must be surrounded with the preprocessor
commands<B> #ifdef__PRIVATE__</B> (with two leading underscores and two
following underscores) and<B> #endif</B>. For example, to declare a method
"foo" as a private method, the following declaration would appear within
the interface statement:
<PRE>   #ifdef __PRIVATE__
   void foo();
   #endif
</PRE>

<P>
Any number of methods and attributes can be designated as private, either
within a single<B> #ifdef</B> or in separate ones. [Kernighan-Ritchie reference
for the C preprocessor: pages 88-92.]
<P>
When compiling an .idl file, the SOM Compiler normally recognizes only public
(nonprivate) methods and attributes, as that is generally all that is needed.
To generate header files for client programs that do need to access private
methods and attributes, or for use when implementing a class library containing
private methods, the<B> -p</B> option should be included when running the
SOM Compiler. The resulting header files will then include bindings for
private, as well as public, methods and attributes. Both the implementation
bindings (.ih or .xih file) and the usage bindings to be #included in the
implementation (.h or .xh file) should be generated under the<B> -p</B> option.
The<B> -p</B> option is described in the topic "Running the SOM Compiler"
later in this chapter.
<P>
The SOMobjects Toolkit also provides a<B> pdl</B> (Public Definition Language)
emitter that can be used with the SOM Compiler to generate a copy of an
.idl file which has the portions designated as private removed. The next
main section of this chapter describes how to invoke the SOM Compiler and
the various emitters.
