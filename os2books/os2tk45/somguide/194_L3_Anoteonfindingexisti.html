<H1>A note on finding existing objects</H1><!-- entering slot 231 -->
<P>
The two examples above show how clients can create a remote, transient object
for their exclusive use. Clients may want to find and use objects that already
exist. In that case, the calls to<B> somdNewObject</B> or<B> somdCreateObj
</B>would be replaced with other "lookup" calls on some directory object
that would take an object name or identifier and return a proxy to the remote
object.
<P>
Such a directory object could be implemented by the application as a persistent
SOM object, using DSOM to share it among processes.
<P>
The basic mechanisms that DSOM provides for naming and locating objects
will be discussed in section  "Basic Client Programming."
