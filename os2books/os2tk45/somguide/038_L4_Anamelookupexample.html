<H1>A name-lookup example</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
The following example shows the use of name-lookup by a SOM client programmer.
Name-lookup resolution is appropriate when a programmer knows that an object
will respond to a method of some given name, but does not know enough about
the type of the object to use offset method resolution. How can this happen?
It normally happens when a programmer wants to write generic code, using
methods of the same name and signature that are applicable to different
classes of objects, and yet these classes have no common ancestor that introduces
the method. This can easily occur in single-inheritance systems (such as
Smalltalk and SOM release 1) and can also happen in multiple-inheritance
systems such as SOM release 2-when class hierarchies designed by different
people are brought together for clients' use.
<P>
If multiple inheritance is available, it is always possible to create a
common class ancestor into which methods of this kind can be migrated. A
refactoring of this kind often implements a semantically pleasing generalization
that unifies common features of two previously unrelated class hierarchies.
This step is most practical, however, when it does not require the redefinition
or recompilation of current applications that use offset resolution. SOM
is unique in that it allows this.
<P>
However, such refactoring must redefine the classes that originally introduced
the common methods (so the methods can be inherited from the new "unifying"
class instead). A client programmer who simply wants to create an application
may not control the implementations of the classes. Thus, the use of name-lookup
method resolution seems the best alternative for programmers who do not
want to define new classes, but simply to make use of available ones.
<P>
For example, assume the existence of two different SOM classes, "classX"
and "classY", whose only common ancestor is<B> SOMObject</B>, and who both
introduce a method named "reduce" that accepts a<I> string</I> as an argument
and returns a<I> long</I>. We assume that the classes were not designed
in conjunction with each other. As a result, it is unlikely that the "reduce"
method was defined with a<B> namelookup</B> modifier. The following figure
illustrates the class hierarchy for this example.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="038_L4_Anamelookupexample_0.gif" WIDTH=492 HEIGHT=377 ALIGN=center>
<P>
Following is a C++ generic procedure that uses name-lookup method resolution
to invoke the "reduce" method on its argument, which may be either of type
"classX" or "classY". Note that there is no reason to include classY's usage
bindings, since the typedef provided for the "reduce" method procedure in
"classX" is sufficient for invoking the method procedure, independently
of whether the target object is of type "classX" or "classY".
<PRE>   #include &lt;classX.xh&gt; // use classX's method proc typedef

   // this procedure can be invoked on a target of type
   // classX or classY.

   long generic_reduce1(SOMObject *target, string arg)
   {
      somTD_classX_reduce reduceProc = (somTD_classX_reduce)
    <B>  somResolveByName</B>(target, "reduce");
      return reduceProc(target, arg);
   }
</PRE>

<P>
On the other hand, If the classes were designed in conjunction with each
other, and the class designer felt that programmers might want to write
generic code appropriate to either class of object, the<B> namelookup</B> modifier
might have been<!-- entering slot 54 --> used. This is a possibility in
SOM release 2, even with multiple inheritance, but it is much more likely
that the class designer would use multiple inheritance to introduce the
reduce method in a separate class, and then use this other class as a parent
for both classX and classY (thereby allowing the use of offset resolution).

<P>
In any case, if the "reduce" method in "classX" were defined as a<B> namelookup
</B>method, the following code would be appropriate.  Note that the name-lookup
support provided by "classX" usage bindings is still appropriate for use
on targets that do not have type "classX".  As a result, the "reduce" method
introduced by "classY" need not have been defined as a<B> namelookup</B> method.

<PRE>   #include &lt;classX.xh&gt; // use classX's name-lookup support

   // this procedure can be invoked on a target of type
   // classX or classY.

   long generic_reduce2(SOMObject *target, string arg)
   {
       return <B>lookup_reduce</B>(target, arg);
   }
</PRE>

<P>
<U><I>For non-C/C++  programmers:</I></U>  Name-lookup  resolution is useful
for non-C/C++ programmers when the type of an object on which a method must
be invoked is not known at compile time or when method tokens cannot be
directly accessed by the programmer. To invoke a method using name-lookup
resolution when not using the C or C++ usage bindings, use the<B> somResolveByName
</B>procedure to acquire a procedure pointer. How the programmer indicates
the method arguments and the linkage convention in this case is compiler
specific.
<P>
The<B> somResolveByName</B>  procedure takes as arguments a pointer to the
object on which the method is to be invoked and the name of the method,
as a string. It returns a pointer to the method's procedure (or NULL if
the method is not supported by the object). The method can then be invoked
by calling the method procedure, passing the method's receiver, the<B> Environment
</B>pointer (if necessary), the<B> context</B> argument (if necessary),
and the rest of the method's arguments, if any. (See the section above for
C programmers; the arguments to a method procedure are the same as the arguments
passed to the long-form C-language method-invocation macro for that method.)

<P>
As an example of invoking methods using name-lookup resolution using the
procedure<B> somResolveByName</B>, the following steps are used to create
an instance of a SOM Class<I> X</I> in Smalltalk:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initialize the SOM run-time environment (if it
is not already initialized) using the<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the class object for class<I> X</I> has not
yet been created, use<B> somResolveByName</B> with the arguments<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B>(returned by<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> in step 1) and the string<I> "somFindClass",
</I>to obtain a method procedure pointer for the<B> somFindClass</B> method.
Use the method procedure for<B> somFindClass</B> to create the class object
for class<I> X</I>: Call the method procedure with these four arguments:
<B>SOMClassMgrObject</B>; the variable holding class<I> X</I> 's<B> somId
</B>(the result of calling the<B> somIdFromString</B> function with argument
<I>"X"</I>); and the major and minor version numbers for class<I> X</I> (or
zero). The result is the class object for class<I> X</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use<B> somResolveByName</B> with arguments the
class object for<I> X</I> (returned by<B> somFindClass</B> in step 2) and
the string<I> "somNew"</I>, to obtain a method procedure pointer for method
<B>somNew</B>. (This<B> somNew</B> method is used to create instances of
a class.)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call the method procedure for<B> somNew</B> (using
the method procedure pointer obtained in step 3) with the class object for
<I>X</I> (returned by<B> somFindClass</B> in step 3) as the argument. The
result is a new instance of class<I> X.</I> How the programmer indicates
the method arguments and the linkage convention is compiler-specific.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
