<H1>Getting the class of an object</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
To get the class that an object is an instance of, SOM provides a method
called<B> somGetClass</B>. The<B> somGetClass</B> method takes an object
as its only argument and returns a pointer to the class object of which
it is an instance. For example, the following statements store in "myClass"
the class object of which "obj" is an instance. myClass = _somGetClass(obj);
 (for C)
<BR>
myClass = obj-&gt;somGetClass();  (for C++)
<BR>

<P>
Getting the class of an object is useful for obtaining information about
the object; in some cases, such information cannot be obtained directly
from the object, but only from its class. The section<B></B> below entitled
"Getting information about a class" describes the methods that can be invoked
on a class object after it is obtained using<B> somGetClass</B>.
<P>
The<B> somGetClass</B> method can be overridden by a class to provide enhanced
or alternative semantics for its objects. Because it is usually important
to respect the intended semantics of a class of objects, the<B> somGetClass
</B>method should normally be used to access the class of an object.
<P>
In a few special cases, it is not possible to make a method call on an object
 in order to determine its class. For such situations, SOM provides the
<B>SOM_GetClass</B>  macro. In general, the<B> somGetClass</B> method and
the<B> SOM_GetClass</B> macro may have different behavior (if<B> somGetClass
</B>has been overridden). This difference may be limited to side effects,
but it is possible for their results to differ as well. The<B> SOM_GetClass
</B>macro should only be used when absolutely necessary.
