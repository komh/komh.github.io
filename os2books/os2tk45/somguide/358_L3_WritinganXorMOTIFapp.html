<H1>Writing an X or MOTIF application</H1><!-- entering slot 407 -->
<P>
Although the Event Manager does not recognize X events, an X or MOTIF application
can be integrated with EMan as follows. First, the necessary initialization
of X or MOTIF should be performed. Next, using the Xlib macro "ConnectionNumber"
or the "XConnectionNumber" function, you can obtain the file descriptor
of the X connection. This file descriptor can be registered with EMan as
a sink. It can be registered for both input events and exception events.
When there is any activity on this X file descriptor, the developer-provided
callback is invoked. The callback can receive the X-event, analyze it, and
do further dispatching. See the example program in Chapter 9, "The Replication
Framework" (section 9.7).
