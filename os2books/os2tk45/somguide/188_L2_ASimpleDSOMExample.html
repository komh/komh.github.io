<H1>A Simple DSOM Example</H1><!-- entering slot 224 -->
<P>
A sample "Stack" application is presented in this section as a tutorial
introduction to DSOM. It demonstrates that, for simple examples like a "Stack",
after very little work, the class can be used to implement distributed objects
that are accessed remotely. The example first presents the "Stack" application
components and the steps that the implementer must perform before the application
can be run, and then describes the run time activity that results from executing
the application. This run-time scenario introduces several of the key architectural
components of the DSOM run-time environment.
<P>
The source code for this example is provided with the DSOM samples in the
SOMobjects Developer Toolkit.
