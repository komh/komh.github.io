<H1>Comments within a SOM IDL file</H1><!-- entering slot 125 -->
<P>
SOM IDL supports both C and C++ comment styles. The characters "//" start
a line comment, which finishes at the end of the current line. The characters
"/*" start a block comment that finishes with the "*/". Block comments do
not nest. The two comment styles can be used interchangeably.
<P>
Comments in a SOM IDL specification must be strictly associated with particular
syntactic elements, so that the SOM Compiler can put them at the appropriate
place in the header and implementation files it generates. Therefore, comments
may appear only in these locations (in general, following the syntactic
unit being commented):<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->At the beginning of the IDL specification<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After a semicolon<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Before or after the opening brace of a module, interface
statement, implementation statement, structure definition, or union definition
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After a comma that separates parameter declarations
or enumeration members<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After the last parameter in a prototype (before the
closing parenthesis)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After the last enumeration name in an enumeration
definition (before the closing brace)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After the colon following a case label of a union
definition<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->After the closing brace of an interface statement
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Numerous examples of the use of comments can be found in the Tutorial of
Chapter 2.
<P>
Because comments appearing in a SOM IDL specification are transferred to
the files that the SOM Compiler generates, and because these files are often
used as input to a programming language compiler, it is best within the
body of comments to avoid using characters that are not generally allowed
in comments of most programming languages. For example, the C language does
not allow "*/" to occur within a comment, so its use is to be avoided, even
when using C++ style comments in the .idl file.
<P>
SOM IDL also supports throw-away comments. They may appear anywhere in an
IDL specification, because they are ignored by the SOM Compiler and are
not transferred to any file it generates. Throw-away comments start with
the string "//#" and end at the end of the line. Throw-away comments can
be used to "comment out" portions of an IDL specification.
<P>
To disable comment processing (that is, to prevent the SOM Compiler from
transferring comments from the IDL specification to the binding files it
generates), use the<B> -c</B> option of the<B> sc</B> or<B> somc</B> command
when running the SOM Compiler (See Section 4.3, "The SOM Compiler").  When
comment processing is disabled, comment placement is not restricted and
comments can appear anywhere in the IDL specification.
