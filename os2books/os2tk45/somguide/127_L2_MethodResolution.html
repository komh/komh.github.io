<H1>Method Resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 157 -->
<P>
<I>Method resolution</I> is the step of determining which procedure to execute
in response to a method invocation. For example, consider this scenario:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Class "Dog" introduces a method "bark", and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A subclass of "Dog", called "BigDog", overrides "bark",
and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A client program creates an instance of either "Dog"
or "BigDog" (depending on some run-time criteria) and invokes method "bark"
on that instance.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Method resolution is the process of determining, at run time, which method
procedure to execute in response to the method invocation (either the method
procedure for "bark" defined by "Dog", or the method procedure for "bark"
defined by "BigDog"). This determination depends on whether the receiver
of the method (the object on which it is invoked) is an instance of "Dog"
or "BigDog" (or perhaps depending on some other criteria).
<P>
SOM allows class implementors and client programs considerable flexibility
in deciding how SOM performs method resolution. In particular, SOM supports
three mechanisms for method resolution, described in order of increased
flexibility and increased computational cost: offset resolution, name-lookup
resolution, and dispatch-function resolution.
