<H1>Proxy objects</H1><!-- entering slot 247 -->
<P>
As far as the client program is concerned, when a remote object is created,
a pointer to the object is returned. However, what is actually returned
is a pointer to a<I> proxy object</I>, which is a local representative for
the remote<I> target object</I>.
<P>
Proxies are responsible for ensuring that operations invoked on it get forwarded
to the "real" target object that it represents. The DSOM run time creates
proxy objects automatically, wherever an object is returned as a result
of some remote operation. The client program will always have a proxy for
each remote target object on which it operates. Proxies are described further
in the sections entitled "DSOM as a CORBA-compliant Object Request Broker"
and "Advanced Topics".
<P>
In the example above, a pointer to a "Car" proxy is returned and put in
the variable "car". Any subsequent methods invoked on "car" will be forwarded
and executed on the corresponding remote "Car" object.
<P>
Proxy objects inherit behavior from the<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> class.
