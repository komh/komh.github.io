<P>
After verifying that the &lt;className&gt; class object exists, the &lt;className&gt;<B>New
</B>macro invokes the<B> somNew</B> method on the class object.  This allocates
enough space for a new instance of &lt;className&gt;, creates a new instance
of the class, initializes this new object by invoking<B> somDefaultInit</B>on
it, and then returns a pointer to it.  The &lt;className&gt;<B>New</B>macro
automatically creates the the class object for &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;,
as well as its ancestor classes and metaclass, if these objects have not
already been created.
<P>
After a client program has finished using an object created using the &lt;<I>className
</I>&gt;<B>New</B> macro, the object should be freed by invoking the method
<B>somFree</B> on it:
<PRE>   _somFree(obj);
</PRE>

<P>
After uninitializing the object by invoking<B> somDestruct</B> on it,<B> somFree
</B>calls the class object for storage deallocation. This is important because
storage for an object created using the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> macro
is allocated by the class of the object. Thus, only the class of the object
can know how to reclaim the object's storage. object for storage deallocation.
