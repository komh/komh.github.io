<H1>Using 'cleanipc'</H1><!-- entering slot 321 -->
<P>
As another alternative, the<B> cleanipc</B> script can be used to free the
IPC resources allocated to a particular AIX user, as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
cleanipc [<I> userId</I> ]<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> Frees resources for the
specified user<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the<I> userId</I> parameter is not specified,<B> cleanipc</B> by default
uses the environment variable USER.
<P>
The<B> cleanipc</B> script should be run only after all DSOM processes have
ended. A limitation of<B> cleanipc</B> is that it is not able to distinguish
between resources that were created by DSOM and resources created by other
products. As a result,<B> cleanipc</B> may affect other applications.
