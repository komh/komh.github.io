<H1>Referring to class objects</H1><!-- entering slot 67 -->
<P>
<U><I>Saving a pointer as the class object is created</I></U>: The &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass
</B>macro and the<B> somFindClass</B> method, used to create class objects,
both return a pointer to the newly created class object. Hence, one way
to obtain a pointer to a class object is to save the value returned by &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>NewClass
</B>or<B> somFindClass</B>  when the class object is created.
<P>
<U><I>Getting a pointer after the class object is created</I></U>: After
a class object has been created, client programs can also get a pointer
to the class object from the class name. When the class name is known at
compile time and the client program is using the C or C++ language bindings,
the macro
<P>
_&lt;<I>className</I>&gt;
<P>
can be used to refer to the class object for &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;. Also,
when the class name is known at compile time and the client program is using
the C or C++ language bindings, the expression
<P>
&lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>ClassData.classObject</B>
<P>
refers to the class object for &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;. For example, _Hello
refers to the class object for class "Hello" in C or C++ programs, and HelloClassData.classObject
refers to the class object for class "Hello." in C or C++ programs.
<P>
<U><I>Getting a pointer to the class object from an instance</I></U>:  If
any instances of the class are known to exist, a pointer to the class object
can also be obtained by invoking the<B> somGetClass</B> method on such an
instance. (See "Getting the class of an object," above.)
<P>
<U><I>Getting a pointer in other situations</I></U>: If the class name is
<I>not</I> known until run time, or if the client program is<I> not</I> using
the C or C++ language bindings, and<I> no</I> instances of the class are
known to exist, then the<B> somClassFromId</B> method can be used to obtain
a pointer to a class object after the class object has been created. The
<B>somClassFromId</B> method should be invoked on the class manager, which
is pointed to by the global variable<B> SOMClassMgrObject.</B> The only
argument to the method is a<B> somId</B> for the class name, which can be
obtained using the<B> somIdFromString</B> function. The method<B> somClassFromId
</B>returns a pointer to the class object of the specified class. For example,
the following C code stores in "myClass" a pointer to the class object for
class "Hello" (or NULL, if the class cannot be located):
<PRE>   SOMClassMgr cm = somEnvironmentNew();
   somId classId = somIdFromString("Hello");
   SOMClass myClass =<B>_somClassFromId</B>(SOMClassMgrObject,classId
                          Hello_MajorVersion, Hello_MinorVersion);
   SOMFree(classId);
</PRE>
