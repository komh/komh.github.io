The SOM Interface Repository (IR) is a database that the SOM Compiler optionally
creates and maintains from the information supplied in IDL source files.
The Interface Repository contains persistent objects that correspond to
the major elements in IDL descriptions. The SOM Interface Repository Framework
is a set of classes that provide methods whereby executing programs can
access these objects to discover everything known about the programming
interfaces of SOM classes.
<P>
The programming interfaces used to interact with Interface Repository objects,
as well as the format and contents of the information they return, are architected
and defined as part of the Object Management Group's CORBA standard. The
classes composing the SOM Interface Repository Framework implement the programming
interface to the CORBA Interface Repository. Accordingly, the SOM Interface
Repository Framework supports all of the interfaces described in<I> The
Common Object Request Broker: Architecture and Specification</I> (OMG Document
Number 91.12.1, Revision 1.1, chapter 7).
<P>
As an extension to the CORBA standard, the SOM Interface Repository Framework
permits storage in the Interface Repository of arbitrary information in
the form of SOM IDL<B> modifiers</B>. That is, within the SOM-unique<B> implementation
</B>section of an IDL source file or through the use of the<B> #pragma modifier
</B>statement, user-defined modifiers can be associated with any element
of an IDL specification. (See the section entitled "SOM Interface Definition
Language" in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler.") When the SOM Compile
creates the Interface Repository from an IDL specification, these potentially
arbitrary modifiers are stored in the IR and can then be accessed via the
methods provided by the Interface Repository Framework.
<P>
This chapter describes, first, how to build and manage interface repositories,
and second, the programming interfaces embodied in the SOM Interface Repository
Framework.
