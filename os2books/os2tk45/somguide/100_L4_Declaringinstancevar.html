<H1>Declaring instance variables and staticdata variables</H1><!-- entering slot 123 -->
<P>
Declarators are used within the body of an<B> implementation</B> statement
(described above) to specify the instance variables that are introduced
by a class, and the staticdata variables pointed to by the class's<B> ClassData
</B>structure. These variables are declared using ANSI C syntax for variable
declarations, restricted to valid SOM IDL types (see "Type and constant
declarations," above). For example, the following<B> implementation</B> statement
declares two instance variables, x and y, and a staticdata variable, z,
for class "Hello," :
<PRE>implementation
{
  short x;
  long y;
  double z;
  z: staticdata;
};
</PRE>

<P>
Instance variables are normally intended to be accessed only by the class's
methods and not by client programs or subclasses' methods. For data to be
accessed by client programs or subclass methods, attributes should be used
instead of instance variables. (Note, however, that declaring an attribute
has the effect of also declaring an instance variable of the same name,
unless the "nodata" attribute modifier is specified.)
<P>
Staticdata variables, by contrast, are publicly available and are associated
specifically with their introducing class. They are, however, very different
in concept from class variables. Class variables are really instance variables
introduced by a metaclass, and are therefore present in any class that is
an instance of the introducing metaclass (or of any metaclass derived from
this metaclass). As a result, class variables present in any given class
will also be present in any class derived from this class (that is, class
variables are inherited). In contrast, staticdata variables are introduced
by a class (not a metaclass) and are (only) accessed from the class's<B> ClassData
</B>structure - they are not inherited.
