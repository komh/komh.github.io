<H1>Placing 'private' information in the Interface Repository</H1><!-- entering slot 369 -->
<P>
When the SOM Compiler updates the Interface Repository in response to the
<B>-u</B> flag, it uses all of the information available from the IDL source
file. However, if the __PRIVATE__ preprocessor variable is used to designate
certain portions of the IDL file as private, the preprocessor actually removes
that information before the SOM Compiler sees it. Consequently, private
information will not appear in the Interface Repository unless the<B> -p
</B>compiler option is also used in conjunction with<B> -u.</B> For example:

<PRE>sc -up myclass1          (On AIX or OS/2)
somc -up myclass1        (On Windows)
</PRE>

<P>
This command will place all of the information in the "myclass1.idl" file,
including the private portions, in the Interface Repository.
<P>
If you are using tools that understand SOM and rely on the Interface Repository
to describe the types and instance data in your classes, you may need to
include the private sections from your IDL source files when building the
Interface Repository.
