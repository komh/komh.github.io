<H1>Generating client events</H1><!-- entering slot 401 -->
<P>
While the other events are caused by the operating system (for example,
Timer), by I/O devices, or by external processes, client events are caused
by the application itself. The application creates these events and enqueues
them with EMan. When client events are dispatched, they are processed in
a callback routine just like any other event. The following code segment
illustrates how to create and enqueue client events.
<PRE>clientEvent1 = SOMEClientEventNew();  /* create a client event */
_somevSetEventClientType( clientEvent1, Ev, "MyClientType" );
_somevSetEventClientData( clientEvent1, Ev,
                                   "I can give any data here");
/* assuming that "MyClientType" is already registered with EMan */
/* enqueue the above event with EMan */
_someQueueEvent(some_gEMan, Ev, clientEvent1);
</PRE>
