<P>
IDL supports a<B> char</B> type, which represents an 8-bit quantity. The
ISO Latin-1 (8859.1) character set defines the meaning and representation
of graphic characters. The meaning and representation of null and formatting
characters is the numerical value of the character as defined in the ASCII
(ISO 646) standard. Unlike C/C++, type<B> char</B> cannot be qualified as
signed or unsigned. (The<B> octet</B> type, below, can be used in place
of unsigned char.)
