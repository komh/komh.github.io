<H1>Registering the class in the Interface Repository</H1><!-- entering slot 236 -->
<P>
Before an object can be accessed remotely by DSOM, it is necessary to register
the class's interface and implementation in the Interface Repository (IR).
DSOM uses the interface information when transforming local method calls
on proxies into request messages transmitted to remote objects.
<P>
DSOM servers also consult the IR to find the name of the DLL for a dynamically
loaded class. The DLL name for the "Stack" class must be specified using
the<B> dllname="stack.dll"</B> modifier in the<B> implementation</B> statement
of the "Stack" IDL. The Interface Repository is described in detail in Chapter
7, "The Interface Repository Framework."
<P>
The IDL specification of "Stack" is compiled into the Interface Repository
using the following command:
<PRE>        sc -u -sir stack.idl               (on AIX or OS/2)
        somc -u -sir stack.idl             (on Windows)
</PRE>

<P>
When a class has not been compiled into the Interface Repository, DSOM will
generate a run-time error when an attempt is made to invoke a method from
that class. The error indicates that the method's descriptor was not found
in the IR.
