<H1>Oneway keyword</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
The optional<B> oneway</B> keyword specifies that when a client invokes
the method, the invocation semantics are "best-effort", which does not guarantee
delivery of the call. "Best-effort" implies that the method will be invoked
at most once. A<B> oneway</B> method should not have any output parameters
and should have a return type of<B> void</B>. A<B> oneway</B> method also
should not include a "raises expression" (see below), although it may raise
a standard exception.
<P>
If the<B> oneway</B> keyword is not specified, then the method has "at-most-once"
invocation semantics if an exception is raised, and it has "exactly-once"
semantics if the method succeeds. This means that a method that raises an
exception has been executed zero or one times, and a method that succeeds
has been executed exactly once.
<P>
Note: Currently the "oneway" keyword, although accepted, has no effect on
the C/C++ bindings that are generated.
