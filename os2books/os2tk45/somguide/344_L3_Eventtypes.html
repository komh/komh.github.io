<H1>Event types</H1><!-- entering slot 393 -->
<P>
Event types are categorized as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Timer events</B>
<P>
These can be either one-time timers or interval timers.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Sink events</B> (sockets, file descriptors, and
message queues)
<P>
On AIX, this includes file descriptors for input/output files, sockets,
pipes, and message queues. On OS/2 and Windows, only TCP/IP sockets are
supported.
<P>
Note:On OS/2 and Windows, the Sockets classes for NetBIOS<B> (NBSockets)
</B>and Novell IPX/SPX (<B>IPXSockets)</B> are primarily intended for use
by DSOM and the Replication Framework, not for general application programming.
(The Replication Framework is available as part of the full-capability SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Client events</B> (any event that the application
wants to queue with EMan)
<P>
These events are defined, created, processed, and destroyed by the application.
EMan simply acts as a place to queue these events for processing. EMan dispatches
these client events whenever it sees them. Typically, this happens immediately
after the event is queued.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Work procedure</B> events (procedures that can
be called when there is no other event)
<P>
These are typically background procedures that the application intends to
execute when there are spare processor cycles. When there are no other events
to process, EMan calls all registered work procedures. A work procedure
event is called only after all other higher priority events have been called.
A work procedure event is not called if there are no other events to be
processed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Event Management Framework is extendible (that is, other event types
can be added to it) through subclassing. The event types currently supported
by EMan are at a sufficiently low level so as to enable building other higher
level application events on top of them. For example, you can build an X-event
handler by simply registering the file descriptor for the X connection with
EMan and getting notified when any X-event occurs.
