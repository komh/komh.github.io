<H1>SOM Compiler qualified modifiers</H1><!-- entering slot 118 -->
<P>
Qualified modifiers are categorized according to the IDL component (class,
attribute, method, or type) to which each modifier applies. Listed below
are the SOM Compiler-defined identifiers used as qualified modifiers, along
with the IDL component to which it applies. Descriptions of all qualified
modifiers are then given in alphabetical order. Recall that qualified modifiers
are defined using the syntax<I> qualifier</I>:<I> modifier</I>[<B>=</B><I>value</I>].

<P>
For parameters whose type is an object, ownership applies to the object
reference rather than to the object (that is, the caller should invoke<B> release
</B>on the parameter, rather than<B> somFree).</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> caller_owns_result
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Specifies that ownership of the return result
of  the method is transferred to the caller, and that the caller is responsible
for freeing the memory. This modifier is only valid in the interface specification
of the method's introducing class. This modifier only makes sense when the
method's return type is a data type that can be freed (string, object, array,
pointer, or TypeCode), or a data item containing memory that can be freed
(for example, a sequence or any). For methods that return an object, ownership
applies to the object reference rather than to the object (that is, the
caller should invoke<B> release</B> on the result, rather than<B> somFree</B>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>const</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates that
implementations of the related method should not modify their target argument.
SOM provides no way to verify or guarantee that implementations do not modify
the targets of such methods, and the information provided by this modifier
is not currently of importance to any of the Toolkit emitters. However,
the information may prove useful in the future. For example, since modifiers
are available in the Interface Repository, there may be future uses of this
information by DSOM.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> impctx</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Supports
types that cannot be fully defined using IDL. For full information, see
"Using the tk_foreign TypeCode" in Chapter 7, "The Interface Repository
Framework."<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> indirect</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Directs
the SOM Compiler to generate "get" and "set" methods for the attribute that
take and return a pointer to the attribute's value, rather than the attribute
value itself. For example, if an attribute x of type float is declared to
be an indirect attribute, then the "_get_x" method will return a pointer
to a float, and the input to the "_set_x" method must be a pointer to a
float. (This modifier is provided for OIDL compatibility only.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> init
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates that a method is an initializer method.
 For information concerning the use of this modifier, see "Initializing
and Uninitializing Objects: in Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM"
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><U><I>method</I></U> or<B> nonstatic</B> or<B>  procedure
</B>
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates the category of method implementation.
Refer to the topic "The four kinds of SOM methods" in Chapter 5, "Implementing
Classes in SOM," for an explanation of the meanings of these different method
modifiers.  If none of these modifiers is specified, the default is<B> method.
</B> Methods with the<B> procedure</B> modifier cannot be invoked remotely
using DSOM.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> migrate  =</B><I> ancestor</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates
that a method originally introduced by this interface has been moved upward
to a specified &lt;ancestor&gt; interface. When this is done, the method
introduction must be removed<!-- entering slot 119 --> from this interface
(because the method is now inherited). However, the original<B>  releaseorder
</B>entry for the method should be retained, and<B> migrate</B> should be
used to assure that clients compiled based on the original interface will
not require recompilation. The ancestor interface is specified using a C-scoped
interface name. For example, "Module_InterfaceName", not "Module::InterfaceName".
See the later topic "Name usage in client programs" for an explanation of
C-scoped names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> namelookup</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> See
<B>"offset</B> or<B> namelookup</B>."<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> nocall
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Specifies that the related method should not
be invoked on an instance of this class even though it is supported by the
interface.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> nodata</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Directs
the SOM Compiler<I> not</I> to define an instance variable corresponding
to the attribute. For example, a "time" attribute would not require an instance
variable to maintain its value, because the value can be obtained from the
operating system.  The "get" and "set" methods for "nodata" attributes must
be defined by the class implementer; stub method procedures for them are
automatically generated in the implementation template for the class by
the SOM Compiler.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> noenv</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates
that a direct-call procedure does not receive an environment as an argument.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>noget</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Directs the
SOM Compiler<I> not</I> to automatically generate a "get" method procedure
for the attribute in the .ih/.xih binding file for the class. Instead, the
"get" method must be implemented by the class implementer. A stub method
procedure for the "get" method is automatically generated in the implementation
template for the class by the SOM Compiler, to be filled in by the implementer.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>nonstatic</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> See<B> "method
</B>or<B> nonstatic</B> or<B> procedure."</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> nooverride
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates that the method should not be overridden
by subclasses. The SOM Compiler will generate an error if this method is
overridden.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> noself</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates
that a direct-call procedure does not receive a target object as an argument.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>noset</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Directs the
SOM Compiler<I> not</I>  to automatically generate a "set" method procedure
for the attribute in the .ih/.xih binding file for the class. Instead, the
"set" method must be implemented by the class implementer. A stub method
procedure for the "set" method is automatically generated in the implementation
template for the class by the SOM Compiler.
<P>
Note: The "set" method procedure that the SOM Compiler generates by default
for an attribute in the .h/.xh binding file (when the<B> noset</B> modifier
is<I> not</I> used) does a shallow copy of the value that is passed to the
attribute. For some attribute types, including strings and pointers, this
may not be appropriate. For instance, the "set" method for an attribute
of type<B> string</B> should perform a string copy, rather than a shallow
copy, if the attribute's value may be needed after the client program has
freed the memory occupied by the string. In such situations, the class implementer
should specify the<B> noset</B> attribute modifier and implement the attribute's
"set" method manually, rather than having SOM implement the "set" method
automatically.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> object_owns_parameters  =</B><I>"p1,
p2, ..., pn"</I>
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Specifies the names of the method's parameters whose
ownership is transferred to (in the case of "in" parameters) or is retained
by (for "inout" or "out" parameters) the object.  For "in" parameters, the
object can free the parameter at any time after receiving it. (Hence, the
caller should not reuse the parameter or pass it as any other object-owned
parameter in the same method call.) For "inout" and "out" parameters, the
object is responsible for freeing the parameter sometime before the object
is destroyed. This modifier is only valid in the interface specification
of the method's introducing class. This modifier only makes sense for parameters
whose IDL type is a data item that can be freed (string, object, array,
pointer, or TypeCode), or a data item containing memory that can be freed
(for example, a sequence or any), or a struct or union.
<P>
For parameters whose type is an object, ownership applies to the object
reference  rather than to the object (that is, the object will invoke<B> release
</B>on the parameter, rather than<B> somFree</B>). For "in" and "out" parameters
whose IDL-to-C/C++ mapping introduces a pointer, ownership applies only
to the data item itself, and not to the introduced pointer. (For example,
even if an "out string" IDL parameter (which becomes a "string *" C/C++
parameter) is designated as "object-owned,"  the object assumes ownership
of the string, but not of the pointer to the string.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> object_owns_result
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Specifies that the object retains ownership
of the return result of the method, and that the caller must not free the
memory. The object is responsible for freeing the memory sometime before
the object is destroyed. This modifier is only valid in the interface specification
of the method's introducing class. This modifier only makes sense when the
method's return type is a data type that can be freed (string, object, array,
pointer, or TypeCode), or a data item containing memory that can be freed
(for example, a sequence or any). For methods that return an object, ownership
applies to the object reference rather than to the object (that is, the
object will be responsible for invoking<B> release</B> on the result, rather
than<B> somFree</B>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><U><I> offset</I></U> or namelookup
<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates<!-- entering slot 120 --> whether the
SOM Compiler should generate bindings for invoking the method using offset
resolution or name lookup.<B> Offset</B> resolution requires that the<B> class
</B>of the method's target object be known at compile time. When different
methods of the same name are defined by several classes,<B> namelookup</B> is
a more appropriate technique for method resolution than is offset resolution.
(See Chapter 3, the section entitled "Invoking Methods.")  The default modifier
is<B> offset.</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> override</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates
that the method is one introduced by an ancestor class and that this class
will re-implement the method. See also the related modifier,<B> select</B>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>procedure</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> See<B> "method
or nonstatic or procedure.</B>"<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> reintroduce</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Indicates
that this interface will "hide" a method introduced by some ancestor interface,
and will replace it with another implementation. Methods introduced as direct-call
procedures or nonstatic methods can be reintroduced. However, static methods
(the default implementation category for SOM met hods) cannot be reintroduced.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>releaseorder:</B><I> a, b, c,</I> ...<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Specifies
the order in which the SOM Compiler will place the class's methods in the
data structures it builds to represent the class. Maintaining a consistent
release order for a class allows the implementation of a class to change
without requiring client programs to be recompiled.
<P>
The release order should contain every method name introduced by the class
(private and nonprivate), but should not include any inherited methods,
even if they are overridden by the class. The "get" and "set" methods defined
automatically for each new attribute (named "_get_&lt;attributeName&gt;"
and "_set_&lt;attributeName&gt;") should also be included in the release
order list. The order of the names on the list is unimportant except that
once a name is on the list and the class has client programs, it should
not be reordered or removed, even if the method is no longer supported by
the class, or the client programs will require recompilation. New methods
should be added only to the end of the list. If a method named on the list
is to be moved up in the class hierarchy, its name should remain on the
current list, but it should also be added to the release order list for
the class that will now introduce it.
<P>
If not explicitly specified, the release order will be determined by the
SOM Compiler, and a warning will be issued for each missing method. If new
methods or attributes are subsequently added to the class, the default release
order might change; programs using the class would then require recompilation.
Thus, it is advisable to explicitly give a release order.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> select
=</B><I> parent</I><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Used in conjunction with the
<B>override</B> modifier, this, indicates that an inherited static method
will use the implementation inherited from the indicated &lt;parent&gt;
class. The parent is specified using the C-scoped name. For example, "Module_InterfaceName",
not "Module:: InterfaceName". See the later topic "Name usage in client
programs" for an explanation of C-scoped names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> staticdata
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Indicates that the declared variable is not
stored within objects, but, instead, that the ClassData structure for the
implementing class will contain a pointer to the staticdata variable. This
is similar in concept to C++ static data members. The staticdata variable
must also be included in the<B> releaseorder.</B> The class implementor
has responsibility for allocating the<B> staticdata</B> variable and for
loading the ClassData structure's pointer to the<B> staticdata</B> variable
during class initialization. (The pointer is accessible as &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;ClassData.&lt;<I>variableName</I>&gt;.)
The implementor's responsibility can be facilitated by writing a special
class initialization function and indicating its name using the<B> classinit
</B>unqualified modifier. (See also the examples that follow.)
<P>
<B>Note: </B><!-- entering slot 121 --> Attributes can be declared as staticdata.
This is an important implementation technique that allows classes to introduce
attributes whose backing storage is not inherited by subclasses.<!-- lm: 0x2 26 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following example illustrates the specification of qualified modifiers:

<PRE>implementation{
  releaseorder : op1, op3, op2, op5, op6, x, y, _set_z, _get_z;
  op1 : persistent;
  somDefaultInit : override, init;
  op2: reintroduce, procedure;
  op3: reintroduce, nonstatic;
  op4: override, select = ModuleName_parentInterfaceName;
  op5: migrate = ModuleName_ancestorInterfaceName;
  op6: procedure, noself, noenv;
  long x;
  x: staticdata;
  y: staticdata; // y and z are attributes
  _set_z: object_owns_parameters = "name";
  _get_z: object_owns_result;
  mymod : a, b;
};
</PRE>

<P>
As shown above for attribute z, separate modifiers can be declared for an
attribute's _set and _get methods, using method modifiers. This capability
may be useful for DSOM applications. (See the DSOM sample program "animal"
that is distributed with the SOMobjects Toolkit.)
<P>
The next example for classes "X" and "Y" illustrates the use of a<B> staticdata
</B>modifier, along with its corresponding<B> classinit</B> modifier and
the template procedure generated for<B> classinit</B> by the SOM Compiler.

<PRE>/* IDL for staticdata and classinit example: */
