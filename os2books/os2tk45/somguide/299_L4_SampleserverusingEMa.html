<H1>Sample server using EMan</H1><!-- entering slot 341 -->
<P>
The following server code has been distilled from one of the DSOM sample
applications provided with SOMobjects Developer Toolkit. It is an example
of a server which has an interval timer that signals another server (via
DSOM) whenever its timer "pops". Thus, it is both a client (of the server
it signals) and a server (because it can receive timer notifications from
other servers).
<P>
The IDL for the server object class to be used by this server program is
as follows. Note that the "noteTimeout" method is oneway, in order to avoid
deadlock.
<PRE>interface PeerServer :<B>SOMDServer</B>
{ oneway void noteTimeout(in string serverName);
  // Notification that a timer event occurred in server serverName
};
</PRE>

<P>
The example server program is outlined as follows. It is assumed that "eman.h"
has been included by the program.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<B>Important </B> Do not use<B> someRegister</B> or<B> someRegisterEV</B> to
register "callback methods" that would be executed on proxy objects. Instead,
write a callback routine that invokes the desired method on the proxy, like
the one shown above, and register that routine using the method<B> someRegisterProc.
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> EMan currently uses the methods<B> someRegister</B> and<B> someRegisterEv
</B>to obtain the address of a method-procedure to call when a specified
event occurs. If EMan directly calls the method-procedure versus<B> somDispatch,
</B>the method call will not be forwarded to the remote object as desired.

<P>
Before the sample is run, two server implementations should be registered
with<B> regimpl.</B> The implementations<!-- entering slot 342 --> are identical
except for their aliases. One may be called "peerServer1" and the other
"peerServer2". The "PeerServer" class should be specified as their server-object
class.
<P>
Whenever peerServer1's timer pops, the Event Manager causes a method, "noteTimeout",
to be sent to the server object in peerServer2. PeerServer2's server object
executes this method by displaying a message on its window. Whenever peerServer2's
timer pops, a similar sequence occurs with peerServer1. The two servers
will run continuously until interrupted.
