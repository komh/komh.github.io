<H1>Client program using a remote stack</H1><!-- entering slot 228 -->
<P>
The preceding program has been rewritten below showing how DSOM can be used
to create and access a "Stack" object somewhere in the system. The exact
location of the object does not matter to the application; it just wants
a "Stack" object. Note that the stack operations of the two programs are
identical. The main differences lie in stack creation and destruction, as
highlighted below. (Also see "Memory management" later for more information
on allocating and freeing memory.)
<PRE><B>#include &lt;somd.h&gt;</B>
#include &lt;stack.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv])
{
  Environment ev;
  Stack stk;
  long num = 100;

  SOM_InitEnvironment(&amp;ev);<B>
  SOMD_Init(&amp;ev);</B>
</PRE>

<PRE>  /* The StackNewClass invocation is optional and unnecessary
   * in the client program when the class object is created in
   * the SOMInitModule function that is invoked during DLL
   * initialization.
   */
  StackNewClass (Stack_MajorVersion, Stack_MinorVersion);   <B>
  stk = _somdNewObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;ev, "Stack", "");</B>

  /* Verify successful object creation */
  if ( OperationOK(&amp;ev) )
  {
     while ( !_full(stk, &amp;ev) )
     {
        _push(stk, &amp;ev, num);
        somPrintf("Top: %d\n", _top(stk, &amp;ev));
        num += 100;
     }

     /* Test stack overflow exception */
     _push(stk, &amp;ev, num);
     OperationOK(&amp;ev);

     while ( !_empty(stk, &amp;ev) )
     {
        somPrintf("Pop: %d\n", _pop(stk, &amp;ev));
     }

     somPrintf("Top Underflow: %d\n", _top(stk, &amp;ev));
     OperationOK(&amp;ev);

     OperationOK(&amp;ev);

     _push(stk, &amp;ev, -10000);
     somPrintf("Top: %d\n", _top(stk, &amp;ev));
     somPrintf("Pop: %d\n", _top(stk, &amp;ev));
        <B>
     _somdDestroyObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;ev, stk);</B>

     if ( OperationOK(&amp;ev) )
     {
        somPrintf("Stack test successfully completed.\n");
     }
  }
<B>  SOMD_Uninit(&amp;ev);</B>
  SOM_UninitEnvironment(&amp;ev);

  return(0);
}
</PRE>

<PRE>boolean OperationOK(Environment *ev)
{
   char *exID;

   switch (ev-&gt;_major)
   {
     case SYSTEM_EXCEPTION:
       exID = somExceptionId(ev);
       somPrintf("System exception: %s\n", exID);
       somdExceptionFree(ev);
       return (FALSE);

     case USER_EXCEPTION:
       exID = somExceptionId(ev);
       somPrintf("User exception: %s\n", exID);
       somdExceptionFree(ev);
       return (FALSE);

     case NO_EXCEPTION:
       return (TRUE);

     default:

       somdExceptionFree(ev);
       return (FALSE);
   }
}

</PRE>

<P>
Let's step through the differences.
<P>
First, every DSOM program must include the file &lt;somd.h&gt; (when using
C ++, &lt;somd.xh&gt;). This file defines constants, global variables, and
run-time interfaces used by DSOM. Usually, this file is sufficient to establish
all necessary DSOM definitions.
<P>
Next, DSOM requires its own initialization call.
<PRE>        SOMD_Init(&amp;ev);
</PRE>

<P>
The call to<B> SOMD_Init</B> initializes the DSOM run-time environment<B> SOMD_Init
</B>must be called before any DSOM run-time calls are made. A side effect
of calling<B> SOMD_Init</B> is that a run-time object, called the<I> DSOM
Object Manager,</I> is created, and a pointer to it is stored in the global
variable,<B> SOMD_ObjectMgr,</B> for programming convenience. The DSOM Object
Manager provides basic run-time support for clients to find, create, destroy,
and identify objects. The Object Manager is discussed in detail in the section
entitled "Basic Client Programming."
<P>
Next, the local stack creation statement,
<PRE>        stk = StackNew();
</PRE>
was replaced by
<PRE>
        stk = _somdNewObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;ev, "Stack", "");
</PRE>

<P>
The call to<B> somdNewObject</B> asks the DSOM Object Manager (<B>SOMD_ObjectMgr</B>)
to create a "Stack" object,<!-- entering slot 229 --> wherever it can find
an implementation of "Stack". (There are other methods with which one can
request specific servers.) If no object could be created, NULL is returned,
and an exception is raised. Otherwise, the object returned is a "Stack"
proxy.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> On AIX, the following call may be needed before the<B> somdNewObject
</B>call, if the "Stack" class implementation has been linked directly with
the program executable (vs. using a dynamic link library, or DLL). This
call will properly initialize the class for use by DSOM (this initialization
is done in<B> SOMInitModule</B>for DLLs):<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
 
<PRE>           StackNewClass(Stack_MajorVersion, Stack_MinorVersion);
</PRE>

<P>
A<I> proxy</I> is an object that is a local representative for a remote
<I>target object.</I> A proxy inherits the target object's interface, so
it responds to the same methods. Operations invoked on the proxy are not
executed locally, but are forwarded to the "real" target object for execution.
The client program always has a proxy for each remote target object on which
it operates.
<P>
From this point on, the client program treats the "Stack" proxy exactly
as it would treat a local "Stack". The "Stack" proxy takes responsibility
for forwarding requests to, and yielding results from, the remote "Stack".
For example,
<PRE>        _push(stk,&amp;ev,num);
</PRE>

<P>
causes a message representing the method call to be sent to the server process
containing the remote object. The DSOM run-time in the server process decodes
the message and invokes the method on the target object. The result (in
this case, just an indication of completion) is then returned to the client
process in a message. The DSOM run time in the client process decodes the
result message and returns any result data to the caller.
<P>
At the end of the original client program, the local "Stack" was destroyed
by the statement,
<PRE>        _somFree(stk);
</PRE>

<P>
whereas, in the client program above, the "Stack" proxy and the remote "Stack"
are destroyed by the statement,
<PRE>        _somdDestroyObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;ev, stk);
</PRE>

<P>
If the client only wants to release its use of the remote object (freeing
the proxy) without destroying the remote object, it can call the<B> somdReleaseObject
</B>method instead of<B> somdDestroyObject</B>.
<P>
Finally, the client must shut down DSOM, so that any operating system resources
acquired by DSOM for communications or process management can be returned:

<PRE>        SOMD_Uninit(&amp;ev);
</PRE>
This call must be made at the end of every DSOM program.
