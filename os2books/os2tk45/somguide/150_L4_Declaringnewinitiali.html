<H1>Declaring new initializers in SOM IDL</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->
<P>
When defining SOMobjects classes, programmers can easily declare and implement
new initializers. Classes can have as many initializers as desired, and
subclassers can invoke whichever of these they want. When introducing new
initializers, developers must adhere to the following rules:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->All initializer methods take a<B> somInitCtrl</B> data
structure as an initial<B> inout</B> parameter (its type is defined in the
SOMobjects header file somapi.h), and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->All initializers return<B> void.</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Accordingly, the<B> somDefaultInit</B> initializer introduced by<B> SOMObject
</B>takes a<B> somInitCtrl</B> structure as its (only) argument, and returns
<B>void.</B> Here is the IDL syntax for this method, as declared in somobj.idl:

<PRE><B>void  somDefaultInit (inout somInitCtrl </B>ctrl);</PRE>

<P>
When introducing a new initializer, it is also necessary to specify the
<B>init</B> modifier in the<B> implementation</B> section. The<B> init</B> modifier
is what tells emitters that the new method is actually an initializer, so
the method can be properly supported from the language bindings. As described
below, this support includes the generation of special initializer stub
procedures in the implementation template file, as well as bindings containing
ancestor-initialization macros and object constructors that invoke the class
implementor's new initializers.
<P>
It is a good idea to begin the names of initializer methods with the name
of the class (or some other string that can be unique for the class). This
is important because all initializers available on a class must be newly
introduced by that class (that is, you cannot override initializers - except
for<B> somDefaultInit).</B> Using a class-unique name means that subclasses
will not be unnecessarily constrained in their choice of initializer names.

<P>
Here are two classes that introduce new initializers:
<PRE>interface Example1 : SOMObject
{
   void <B>Example1_withName</B> (inout somInitCtrl ctrl,in string name);
   void <B>Example1_withSize</B> (inout somInitCtrl ctrl,in long size);
   void <B>Example1_withNandS</B>(inout somInitCtrl ctrl,in string name,
                                                   in long size);
        implementation {
                releaseorder: Example1_withName,
                              Example1_withSize,
                              Example1_withNandS; <B>
                somDefaultInit: override, </B>init;<B>
                somDestruct: override;</B>
                Example1_withName: <B>init;</B>
                Example1_withSize: <B>init;</B>
                Example1_withNandS:<B> init;</B>
        };
};

interface Example2 : Example1
{
   void <B>Example2_withName</B>(inout somInitCtrl ctrl, in string name);
   void <B>Example2_withSize</B>(inout somInitCtrl ctrl, in long size);
        implementation {
                releaseorder: Example2_withName,
                              Example2_withSize; <B>
                somDefaultInit: override, init;
                somDestruct: override;</B>
                Example2_withName: <B>init;</B>
                Example2_withSize: <B>init;</B>
        };
};
</PRE>

<P>
Here, interface "Example1" declares three new initializers. Notice the use
of<B> inout somInitCtrl</B> as the first argument of each initializer, and
also note that the<B> init</B> modifier is used in the<B> implementation
</B>section. These two things are required to declare initializers. Any
number of initializers can be declared by a class. "Example2" declares two
initializers.
<P>
"Example1" and "Example2" both override the<B> somDefaultInit</B> initializerThis
initializer method is introduced by<B> SOMObject</B> and is special for
two resons: First,<B> somDefaultInit</B> is the only initializer that can
be overridden And, second, SOMobjects arranges that this initializer will
always be available on any class (as further explained below).
<P>
Historically in the SOMobjects Toolkit, object#initialization methods by
default have invoked the<B> somInit</B> method, which class implementors
could override to customize initialization as appropriate. SOMobjects continues
to support this approach, so that existing code (and class binaries) will
execute correctly. However, the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method is now the
preferred form of initialization because it offers greatly improved efficiency.

<P>
Even if no specialized initialization is needed for a class, you should
still<B> override</B> the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method in the interest of
efficiency. If you do not override<B> somDefaultInit,</B> then a generic
(and therefore less efficient)<B> somDefaultInit</B> method<!-- entering slot 182 --> procedure
will be used for your class. This generic method procedure first invokes
<B>somDefaultInit</B> on the appropriate ancestor classes. Then (for consistency
with earlier versions of SOMobjects), it checks to determine if the class
overrides<B> somInit</B> and, if so, calls any customized somInit code provided
by the class.
<P>
When you override<B> somDefaultInit,</B> the emitter's implementation template
file will include a stub procedure similar to those used for other initializers,
and you can fill it in as appropriate (or simply leave it as is). Default
initialization for your class will then run much faster than with the generic
method procedure. Examples of initializer stub procedures (and customizations)
are given below.
<P>
In summary, the initializers available for any class of objects are<B> somDefaultInit
</B>(which you should always<B> override)</B> plus any new initializers
explicitly declared by the class designer. Thus, "Example1" objects may
be initialized using any of four different initializers (the three that
are explicitly declared, plus<B> somDefaultInit).</B> Likewise, there are
three initializers for the "Example2" objects. Some examples of using initializers
are provided below.
