<H1>Sockets class</H1><!-- entering slot 353 -->
<P>
To aid in portability, DSOM has been written to use a common communications
interface, which is implemented by one or more available local protocols.

<P>
The common communications interface is represented as an abstract class,
called Sockets, and is based on the familiar "sockets" interface. Several
protocol implementations are supported as<B> Sockets</B> subclasses:<B> TCPIPSockets
</B>(and<B> TCPIPSockets32</B> for OS/2) for TCP/IP, the class<B> NBSockets
</B>for Netbios, and the class<B> IPXSockets</B> for Netware IPX/SPX. (The
libraries included in a particular SOMobjects run-time package will vary.)

<P>
There is one case where a<B> Sockets</B> subclass is not required: the DSOM
Workstation run-time package uses shared memory to pass messages within
a single machine, and bypasses the use of a<B> Sockets</B> subclass. (The
SOMSOCKETS environment variable is ignored.)
<P>
When the Event Management Framework (EMan) is used with DSOM, a<B> Sockets
</B>subclass will be needed to support EMan, whether or not the application
runs completely within a single machine.
<P>
Appendix C, "Implementing Sockets Subclasses," describes how an application
might provide its own<B> Sockets</B> subclass implementation, for special
circumstances.
