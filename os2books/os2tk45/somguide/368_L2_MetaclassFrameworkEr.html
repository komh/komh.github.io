It is possible to receive the following messages from the Metaclass Framework
while an application is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> An attempt was made to construct a class with
<B>SOMMSingleInstance</B> as a metaclass constraint. (This may occur indirectly
because of the construction of a derived metaclass). The initialization
of the class failed because<B> somInitMIClass</B> defined by<B> SOMMSingleInstance
</B>is in conflict with another metaclass that has overridden<B> somNew.
</B>That is, some other metaclass has already claimed the right to return
the value for<B> somNew.</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> A
Before/After Metaclass must override both<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> and<B> sommAfterMethod.
</B> This message indicates an attempt to create a Before/After Metaclass
where only one of the above methods is overridden.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
