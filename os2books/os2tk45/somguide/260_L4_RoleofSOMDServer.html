<H1>Role of SOMDServer</H1><!-- entering slot 298 -->
<P>
The server process's server object (whose default class is<B> SOMDServer</B>)
is responsible for creating/destroying objects on the server via<B> somdCreateObj,
somdGetClassObj,</B> and<B> somdDeleteObj</B>, for mapping between object
references<B> (SOMDObjects)</B> and<B> SOMObjects</B> via<B> somdRefFromSOMObj
</B>and<B> somdSOMObjFromRef</B>, and for dispatching remote requests to
server process objects via<B> somdDispatchMethod</B>. These last three methods
are invoked on the server object by the<B> SOMOA</B> when objects are to
be returned to clients, when incoming requests contain object references,
and when the method is ready to be dispatched, respectively. By partitioning
out these mapping and dispatching functions into the server object, the
application can more easily customize them, without having to build object
adapter subclasses.
<P>
<B>SOMDServer</B> can be subclassed by applications that want to manage
object location, object activation, and method dispatching. An example of
such an application (which provides a server class implementation for persistent
SOM objects) is shown in section 6.4, "Basic Server Programming."
<P>
These features of<B> SOMOA</B> and<B> SOMDServer</B> make it possible to
take existing OM classes, which have been written for a single-address space
environment, and use them unchanged in a DSOM application. More information
on the<B> SOMOA</B> and server objects can be found in the "Basic Server
Programming" section.
