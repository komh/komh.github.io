<H1>Initializer methods</H1><!-- entering slot 180 -->
<P>
As noted above, in the SOMobjects Toolkit each ancestor of an object contributes
to the initialization of that object. Initialization of an object involves
a chain of ancestor-method calls that, by default, are automatically determined
by the SOM Compiler emitters. The SOMobjects framework for initialization
of objects is based on the following approach:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SOMobjects recognizes initializers as a special
kind of method, and supports a special mechanism for ordering the execution
of ancestor-initializer method procedures. The<B> SOMObject</B> class introduces
an initializer method,<B> somDefaultInit</B> that uses this execution mechanism.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The SOM Compiler's emitters provide special support
for methods that are declared as initializers in the .idl file. To supplement
the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method, SOM class designers can also declare additional
initializers in their own classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Two SOM IDL modifiers are provided for declaring initializer methods and
controlling their execution,<B> init</B> and<B> directinitclasses</B>:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> init</B> modifier is required in order to designate
a given method is a initializer; that is, to indicate that the method both
uses and supports the object-initialization protocol described here.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B>  directinitclasses</B> modifier can be used
to control the order of execution of initializer method procedures provided
by the different ancestors of the class of an object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For full definitions of<B> init</B> and<B> directinitclasses,
</B>see the topic "Modifier statements" in Chapter 4,"SOM IDL and the SOM
Compiler."<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Every SOM class has a list that defines (in sequential order) the ancestor
classes whose initializer method procedures the class should invoke. If
a class's IDL does not specify an explicit<B> directinitclasses</B> modifier,
the default for this list is simply the class's parents - in left-to-right
order.
<P>
Using the<B> directinitclasses</B> list and the actual run-time class hierarchy
above itself, each class inherits from<B> SOMClass</B> the ability to create
a data structure of type<B> somInitCtrl.</B> This structure is used to control
the execution of initializers. Moreover, it represents a particular visit-ordering
that reaches each class in the transitive closure of<B> directinitclasses
</B>exactly once. To initialize a given object, this visit-ordering occurs
as follows: While recursively visiting each ancestor class whose initializer
method procedure should be run, SOMobjects first runs the initializer method
procedures of all of that class's<B> directinitclasses</B> if they have
not already been run by another class's initializers, with ancestor classes
always taken in left-to-right order.
<P>
The code that deals with the<B> somInitCtrl</B> data structure is generated
automatically within the implementation bindings for a class, and need not
concern a class implementor.
<P>
When an instance of a given class (or some descendant class) is initialized,
only one of the given class's initializers will be executed, and this will
happen exactly once (under control of the ordering determined by the class
of the object being initialized).
<P>
The<B> somInitCtrl</B> structure solves a problem originally created by
the add         ition of multiple inheritance to SOMobjects 2.0. With multiple
inheritance, any class can appear at the top of a multiple inheritance diamond.
Previously, whenever this happened, the class could easily receive multiple
initialization calls. In the current version of the SOMobjects Toolkit,
however, the<B> somInitCtrl</B> structure prevents this from happening.
