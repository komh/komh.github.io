<H1>Customizing the initialization of class objects</H1><!-- entering slot 193 -->
<P>
As described previously, the<B> somDefaultInit</B> method can be overridden
to customize the initialization of objects. Because classes are objects,
<B>somDefaultInit</B> is also invoked on classes when they are first created
(generally by invoking the<B> somNew</B> method on a metaclass). For a class
object, however,<B> somDefaultInit</B> normally just sets the name of the
class to "unknown," after which the<B> somInitMIClass</B> method must be
used for the major portion of class initialization. Of course, metaclasses
can override<B> somDefaultInit</B> to initialize introduced class variables
that require no arguments for their initialization.
<P>
Note: Because<B> somNew</B> does not call<B> somInitMIClass,</B> class objects
returned from invocations of<B> somNew</B> on a metaclass are not yet useful
class objects.
<P>
The<B> somInitMIClass</B> method (introduced by<B> SOMClass</B>) is invoked
on a new class object using arguments to indicate the class name and the
parent classes from which inheritance is desired (among other arguments).
This invocation is made by whatever routine is used to initialize the class.
(For SOM classes using the C or C++ implementation bindings, this is handled
by the<B> somBuildClass</B> procedure, which is called by the implementation
bindings automatically.) The<B> somInitMIClass</B> method is often overridden
by a metaclass to influence initialization of new classes in some way. Typically,
the overriding procedure begins by making parent method calls, and then
performs additional actions thereafter.
<P>
However, without use of the Cooperative Metaclass to guarantee correct operation
of SOMobjects in general, none of the methods introduced by<B> SOMClass
</B>should be overridden. As a result, customizing the initialization of
class objects (other than through overriding<B> somDefaultInit</B> for initialization
of class variables) is not recommended in SOMobjects 2.1.  Users whose applications
require this should request access to the experimental Cooperative Metaclass
used to implement the SOMobjects Metaclass Framework.  But, metaclasses
implemented using the experimental Cooperative Metaclass may require reprogramming
when SOMobjects introduces an officially supported Cooperative Metaclass.
