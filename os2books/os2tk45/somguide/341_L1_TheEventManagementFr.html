<H1>The Event Management Framework</H1><!-- entering slot 390 -->
<P>
The<B> Event Management Framework</B> is a central facility for registering
all events of an application. Such a registration facilitates grouping of
various application events and waiting on multiple events in a single event-processing
loop. This facility is used by the Replication Framework and by DSOM to
wait on their respective events of interest. The Event Management Framework
must also be used by any interactive application that contains DSOM or replicated
objects.
