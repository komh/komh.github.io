<H1>Registering the server in the Implementation Repository</H1><!-- entering slot 237 -->
<P>
It is necessary to register a description of a server's implementation in
the Implementation Repository. DSOM uses this information to assist clients
in finding servers, and in activating server processes upon demand.
<P>
For this example, where the default server is used, we need only to identify
the server's name, and the class that the server implements. This is accomplished
using the<B> regimpl</B> utility discussed in section 6.6, "Configuring
DSOM Applications". The following commands define a default server, named
"StackServer", which supports the Stack class:
<PRE>        regimpl -A -i StackServer
        regimpl -a -i StackServer -c Stack
</PRE>
