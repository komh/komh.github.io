<H1>Parameter list</H1><!-- entering slot 111 -->
<P>
The "parameter-list" contains zero or more parameter declarations for the
method, delimited by commas. (The target object for the method is not explicitly
specified as a method parameter in IDL, nor are the<B> Environment</B> or
<B>Context</B> parameters.)  If there are no explicit parameters, the syntax
"( )" must be used, rather than "(void)". A parameter declaration has the
following syntax:
<P>
{<B> in</B> Æ<B> out</B> Æ<B> inout</B> } <I> type-spec  declarator</I>
<P>
where "type-spec" is any valid IDL type and "declarator" is an identifier,
array declarator, or pointer declarator.
<P>
<U><I>In, out, inout</I></U> parameters:  The required<B> in</B>Æ<B>out</B>Æ<B>inout
</B>directional attribute indicates whether the parameter is to be passed
from client to server (<B>in</B>), from server to client (<B>out</B>), or
in both directions (<B>inout</B>). A method must not modify an<B> in</B>
parameter. If a method raises an exception, the values of the return result
and the values of the<B> out</B> and<B> inout</B> parameters (if any) are
undefined. When an unbounded<B> string</B> or<B> sequence</B> is passed
as an<B> inout</B> parameter, the returned value must be no longer than
the input value.
<P>
The following are examples of valid method declarations in SOM IDL:
<PRE>   short meth1(in char c, out float f);
   oneway void meth2(in char c);
   float meth3();
</PRE>

<P>
Classes derived from<B> SOMObject</B> can declare methods that take a pointer
to a block of memory containing a variable number of arguments, using a
final parameter of type<B> va_list</B>. The<B> va_list</B> must use the
parameter name "ap", as in the following example:
<PRE>   void MyMethod(in short numArgs, in va_list ap);
</PRE>

<P>
For<B> in</B> parameters of type<B> array</B>, C and C++ clients must pass
the address of the first element of the array. For<B> in</B> parameters
of type<B> struct</B>,<B>  union, sequence</B> or<B> any,</B> C/C++ clients
must pass the address of a variable of that type, rather than the variable
itself.
<P>
For all IDL types except<B> arrays</B>, if a parameter of a method is<B> out
</B>or<B> inout</B>, then C/C++ clients must pass the address of a variable
of that type (or the value of a pointer to that variable) rather than the
variable itself. (For example, to invoke method "meth1" above, a pointer
to a variable of type<B> float</B> must be passed in place of parameter
"f".) For<B> arrays</B>, C/C++ clients must pass the address of the first
element of the<B> array</B>.
<P>
If the return type of a method is a<B> struct, union, sequence</B>, or<B> any
</B>type, then for C/C++ clients, the method returns the value of the C/C++
struct representing the IDL<B> struct, union, sequence</B>, or<B> any</B>.
If the return type is<B> string,</B> then the method returns a pointer to
the first character of the<B> string</B>. If the return type is<B> array</B>,
then the method returns a pointer to the first element of the<B> array</B>.

<P>
The pointers implicit in the parameter types and return types for IDL method
declarations are made explicit in SOM's C and C++ bindings. Thus, the stub
procedure that the SOM Compiler generates for method "meth1", above, has
the following signature:
<PRE>   SOM_Scope short  SOMLINK meth1(char c, float *f)
</PRE>

<P>
For C and C++ clients, if a method has an<B> out</B> parameter of type<B>
string</B><B> sequence</B>, or<B> any</B>, then the method must allocate
the storage for the<B> string,</B> for the "_buffer" member of the struct
that represents the<B> sequence,</B> or for the "_value" member of the struct
that represents the<B> any</B>. It is then the responsibility of the client
program to free the storage when it is no longer needed. Similarly, if the
return type of a method is<B> string</B>,<B> sequence</B>,<B> array</B>,
or<B> any</B>, then storage must be allocated by the method, and it will
be the responsibility of the client program to subsequently free it.
<P>
Note: The foregoing description also applies for the<B> _get_</B> &lt;<I>attributeName</I>&gt;
method associated with an attribute of type<B> string, sequence, any,</B> or
<B>array.</B>  Hence, the attribute should be specified with a "noget" modifier
to override automatic implementation of the attribute's "get" method.  Then,
needed memory can be allocated by the developer's "get" method implementation
and subsequently deallocated by the caller.  (The "noget" modifier is described
under the topic "Modifier statements" later in this section.)
