<H1>SOMClass class object</H1><!-- entering slot 150 -->
<P>
Because SOM classes are run-time objects, and since all run-time objects
are instances of some class, it follows that a SOM class object must also
be an instance of some class. The class of a class is called a<U> metaclass</U>.
Hence, the instances of an ordinary class are individuals (nonclasses),
while the instances of a metaclass are class objects.
<P>
In the same way that the class of an object defines the "instance methods"
that the object can perform, the metaclass of a class defines the "class
methods" that the class itself can perform.<U> Class methods</U> (sometimes
called<I> factory methods</I> or<I> constructors</I>) are performed by class
objects. Class methods perform tasks such as creating new instances of a
class, maintaining a count of the number of instances of the class, and
other operations of a "supervisory" nature. Also, class methods facilitate
inheritance of instance methods from parent classes. For information on
the distinction between parent classes and metaclasses, see the section
"Parent Class vs. metaclass," later in this chapter.
<P>
<U><I>SOMClass</I></U> is the root class for all SOM<U> metaclasses</U>.
 That is, all SOM metaclasses must be subclasses of<B> SOMClass</B> or of
some metaclass derived from<B> SOMClass</B>.<B> SOMClass</B> defines the
essential behavior common to all SOM<U> class objects</U>.  In particular,
<B>SOMClass</B> provides:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Six class methods for creating new class instances:
<B>somNew, somNewNoInit, somRenew, somRenewNoInit, somRenewNoZero</B>  and
<B>somRenewNoInitNoZero</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A number of class methods that dynamically obtain
or update information about a class and its methods at run time, including:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><B>somInitMIClass,</B> for implementing multiple
inheritance from parent classes,<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><B>somOverrideSMethod,</B> for overriding inherited
methods, and<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><B>somAddStaticMethod</B> and<B> somAddDynamicMethod</B>,
for including new methods.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>SOMClass</B> is a subclass (or child) of<B> SOMObject</B>. Hence, SOM
<I>class objects</I> can also perform the same set of basic<I> instance
methods</I> common to all SOM objects. This is what allows SOM classes to
be real objects in the SOM run-time environment.<B> SOMClass</B> also has
the unique distinction of being its own metaclass (that is,<B> SOMClass
</B>defines its own class methods).
<P>
A user-defined class can designate as its metaclass either<B> SOMClass</B> or
another user-written metaclass descended from<B> SOMClass</B>. If a metaclass
is not explicitly specified, SOM determines one automatically.
