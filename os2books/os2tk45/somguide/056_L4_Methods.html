<H1>Methods</H1><!-- entering slot 73 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>somGetClass</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Gets the class object of a specified
object. The receiver of the method is the object whose class is desired.
The method returns a pointer to the object's corresponding class object.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>somGetClassName</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Obtains
the class name of an object. The receiver of the method is the object whose
class name is desired. The method returns a pointer to the name of the class
of which the specified object is an instance.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somGetSize
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Obtains the size of an object. The receiver
of the method is the object. The method returns the amount of contiguous
space, in bytes, that is needed to hold the object itself (not including
any additional space that the object may be using or managing outside of
this area).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somIsA</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Determines
whether an object is an instance of a given class or of one of its descendant
classes. The receiver of the method is the object to be tested. An additional
argument is the name of the class to which the object will be compared.
This method returns TRUE if the object is an instance of the specified class
or if (unlike<B> somIsInstanceOf</B>) it is an instance of any descendant
class of the given class; otherwise, the method returns FALSE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somIsInstanceOf
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Determines whether an object is an instance
of a specific class (but not of any descendant class).The receiver of the
method is the object. The argument is the name of the class to which the
object will be compared. The method returns TRUE if the object is an instance
of the specified class, or FALSE otherwise.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somRespondsTo
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Determines whether an object supports a given
method. The receiver of the method is the object. The argument is the<B> somId
</B>for the method in question. (A<B> somId</B> can be obtained from a string
by using the<B> somIdFromString</B> function.) The<B> somRespondsTo</B> method
returns TRUE if the object supports the method, or FALSE otherwise.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
