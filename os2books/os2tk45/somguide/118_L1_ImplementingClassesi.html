<H1>Implementing Classes in SOM</H1><!-- entering slot 146 -->
<P>
This chapter begins with a more in-depth discussion of SOM concepts and
the SOM run-time environment than was appropriate in <A HREF="015_L1_TutorialforImplement.html">Tutorial
for Implementing SOM Classes</A>. Subsequent sections then provide information
about completing an implementation template file, updating the template
file, compiling and linking, packaging classes in libraries, and other useful
topics for class implementors. During this process, you can refer to Chapter
4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler," if you want to read the reference information
or see the full syntax related to topics discussed in this chapter. The
current chapter ends with topics describing how to customize SOMobjects
execution in various ways.
