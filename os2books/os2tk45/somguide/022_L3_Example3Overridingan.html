<H1>Example 3-Overriding an Inherited Method</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
An important aspect of OOP programming is the ability of a subclass to replace
an inherited method implementation with a new implementation especially
appropriate to its instances.  This is called<I> overriding llo"q.</I>  a
method.  Sometimes, a class may introduce methods that every descendant
class is expected to override.  For example,<B> SOMobject  ves</B>  introduces
the<B> somPrintSelf</B> method, and a good SOM programmer will generally
override this method when implementing a new class.
<P>
The purpose of<B> somPrintSelf</B> is to print a brief description of an
object.  The method can be useful when debugging an application that deals
with a number of objects of the same class -assuming the class designer
has overridden<B> somPrintSelf</B> with a message that is useful in distinguishing
different objects of the class.  For example, the implementation of<B> somPrintSelf
</B>provided by<B> SOMobjects</B> simply prints the class of the object
and its address in memory. <B> SOMclass</B> overrides this method so that,
when<B> somPrintSelf</B> is invoked on a class object, the name of the class
will print.
<P>
This example illustrates how<B> somPrintSelf</B> might be overridden for
the "Hello" class.  An important identifying characteristic of "Hello" objects
is the message they hold; thus, the following steps illustrate how<B> somPrintSelf
</B>could be overridden in "Hello" to provide this information.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Modify the interface declaration in "hello.idl."

<P>
To override the<B> somPrintSelf</B> method in "Hello", additionalinformation
must be provided in "hello.idl" in the form of an<B> implementation</B> statement,
which gives extra information about the class, its methods and attributes,
and any instance variables.  (The previous examples omitted the optional
"implementation" statement, because it was not needed.)
<P>
In the current example, the "implementation" statement introduces the<I> modifiers
</I> for the "Hello" class, as follows.
<PRE>   #include &lt;somobj.idl&gt;

   interface Hello : SOMObject
   {
     void sayHello();

     attribute string msg;

     #ifdef __SOMIDL__
     <B>implementation</B>
     {
             //# Method Modifiers:
             <B>somPrintSelf: override;</B>
             // Override the inherited implementation of somPrintSelf.
     };
     #endif

     };
</PRE>

<P>
Here, "somPrintSelf:" introduces a list of<I> modifiers</I>  for the (inherited)
<B>somPrintSelf</B> method in the class "Hello".  Modifiers are like C/C
++ #pragma commands and give specific implementation details to the compiler.
This example uses only one modifier, "override." Because of the "override"
modifier, when<B> somPrintSelf</B> is invoked on an instance of class "Hello",
Hello's implementation of<B> somPrintSelf</B> (in the implementation file)
will be called, instead of the implementation inherited from the parent
class,<B> SOMObject</B>.
<P>
The "#ifdef__SOMIDL__" and "#endif" are standard C and C++ preprocessor
commands that cause the "implementation" statement to be read only when
using the SOM IDL compiler (and not some other IDL compiler).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Re-run the SOM Compiler on the updated .idl file,
as before.  The SOM Compiler extends the existing implementation file from
Example 2 to include new stub procedures as needed (in this case, for<B> somPrintSelf</B>).
Below is a shortened version of the C language implementation file as updated
by the SOM Compiler; C++ implementation files are similarly revised.  Notice
that the code previously added to the "sayHello" method is not disturbed
when the SOM Compiler updates the implementation file.
<PRE>   #include &lt;hello.ih&gt;

   SOM_Scope void   SOMLINK sayHello(Hello somSelf, Environment  *ev)
   {
       /* HelloData *somThis = HelloGetData(somSelf); */
       HelloMethodDebug("Hello","sayHello");

       printf("%s\n", __<!-- entering slot 30 -->get_msg(somSelf, ev));
   }

   SOM_Scope void   SOMLINK  <B>somPrintSelf(Hello somSelf)</B>
   {
       HelloData *somThis = HelloGetData(somSelf);
       HelloMethodDebug("hello","somPrintSelf");

         Hello_parent_SOMObject_somPrintSelf(somSelf);
   }
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the SOM Compiler added code allowing the "Hello" class to redefine
<B>somPrintSelf</B>.  The SOM Compiler provides a default implementation
for overriding the<B> somPrintSelf</B> method.  This default implementation
simply calls the "parent method" [the procedure that the parent class of
"Hello" (<B>SOMObject</B>) uses to implement the<B> somPrintSelf</B> method].
This parent method call is accomplished by the macro<B> Hello_parent_SOMObject_somPrintSelf
</B>defined in "hello.ih."
<P>
Notice that the stub procedure for overriding the<B> somPrintSelf</B> method
does not include an Environment parameter. This is because<B> somPrintSelf
</B>is introduced by<B> SOMObject</B>, which does not include the Environment
parameter in any of its methods (to ensure backward compatibility). The
signature for a method cannot change after it has been introduced.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Customize the implementation.
<P>
Within the new<B> somPrintSelf</B> method procedure, display a brief description
of the object, appropriate to "Hello" objects.  Note that the parent method
call is not needed, so it has been deleted.  Also, direct access to instance
data introduced by the "Hello" class is not required, so the assignment
to "somThis" has been commented out (see the first line of the procedure).

<PRE>   SOM_Scope void   SOMLINK somPrintSelf(Hello somSelf)
   {
       HelloData *somThis = HelloGetData(somSelf);
       HelloMethodDebug("Hello","somPrintSelf");

<B>     somPrintf("--a %s object at location %x with msg:s\n",
                   _somGetClassName(somSelf),
                   somSelf,
                   __get_msg(somSelf,0));
</B>   }
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

(also notice the new message text):
