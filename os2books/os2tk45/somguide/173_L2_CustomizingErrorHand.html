<H1>Customizing Error Handling</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
When an error occurs within any of the SOM-supplied methods or functions,
an error-handling procedure is invoked. The default error-handling procedure
supplied by SOM, pointed to by the global variable<B> SOMError</B>, has
the following signature:
<P>
<B>void  (*SOMError) (int</B><I> errorCode</I><B> ,  string</B><I> fileName</I><B>,
 int</B><I> lineNum</I><B> );</B>
<P>
The default error-handling procedure inspects the<I>  errorCode</I>  argument
and takes appropriate action, depending on the last decimal digit of<I> errorCode
</I>(see "Exceptions and error handling" in <A HREF="025_L1_UsingSOMClassesinCli.html">Using
SOM Classes in Client Programs</A> for a discussion of error classifications).
In the default error handler, fatal errors terminate the current process.
The remaining two arguments (<I>fileName</I> and<I> lineNum</I>), which
indicate the name of the file and the line number within the file where
the error occurred, are used to produce an error message.
<P>
An application programmer might wish to replace the default error handler
with a customized error-handling routine to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Record errors in a way appropriate to the particular
application,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inform the user through the application's user interface,
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Attempt application-level recovery by restarting at
a known point, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Shut down the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An application program would use code similar to the following to install
the replacement routine:
<PRE>#include &lt;som.h&gt;/* Define a replacement routine: */
void myErrorHandler (int errorCode, string fileName, int lineNum)
{
     (Customized code goes here)
}
...
/* After the next stmt all errors */
/* will be handled by the new routine   */
SOMError = myErrorHandler;
</PRE>

<P>
When any error condition originates within the classes supplied with SOM,
SOM is left in an internally consistent state. If appropriate, an application
program can trap errors with a customized error-handling procedure and then
resume with other processing. Application programmers should be aware, however,
that all methods within the SOM run-time library behave<I> atomically</I>.
That is, they either succeed or fail; but if they fail, partial effects
are undone wherever possible. This is done so that all SOM methods remain
usable and can be re-executed following an error.
