<H1>Context expression</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
The optional context expression ("context-expr") in a method declaration
indicates which elements of the client's context the method may consult.
A context expression is specified as follows:
<P>
<B>context (</B><I> identifier1</I><I>,</I><I> identifier2</I><I>,</I> ...
<B>)</B>
<P>
where each "identifier" is a string literal made up of alphanumeric characters,
periods, underscores, and asterisks. (The first character must be alphabetic,
and an asterisk can only appear as the last character, where it serves as
a wildcard matching any characters. If convenient, identifiers may consist
of period-separated valid identifier names, but that form is optional.)

<P>
The<B> Context</B> is a special object that is specified by the CORBA standard.
 It contains a properly list - a set of property-name/string-value pairs
that the client can use to store information about its environment that
methods may find useful.  It is used in much the same way as environment
variables.  It is passed as an additional (third) parameter to CORBA-compliant
methods that are defined as "context-sensitive" in IDL, along with the CORBA-defined
Environment structure.
<P>
The<B> context expression</B> of a mehod declaration in IDL specifies which
property names the method uses.  If these properties are present in the
<B>Context</B> object supplied by the client, they will be passed to the
object implementation, which can access them via the<B> get_values</B> method
of the<B> Context</B> object. However, the argument that is passed to the
method having a context expression is a<B> Context</B> object, not the names
of the properties.  The client program must either create a<B> Context</B> object
and use the<B> set_values</B> or<B> set_one_value</B> method of the<B> Context
</B>class to set the context properties, or use the<B> get_default_context
</B>method. The client program then passes the<B> Context</B> object in
the method invocation.  Note that the CORBA standard also allows properties
in addition to those in the<B> context</B> expression to be passed in the
<B>Context</B> object.
<P>
In Chapter 3, "Using SOM Classes in Client Programs," the topic "Invoking
Methods" describes the placement of a<B> context</B> parameter in a method
call. See also Chapter 6 of<I> The Common Object Request Broker: Architecture
and Specification</I> for a discussion of how clients associate values with
<B>context</B> identifiers. A description of the<B> Context</B> class and
its methods is contained in the<I> SOMobjects Developer Toolkit: Programmers
Reference Manual.</I>
