<H1>Uninitialization</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
An object should always be uninitialized before its storage is freed. This
is important because it also allows releasing resources and freeing storage
not contained within the body of the object.  SOMobjects handles uninitialization
in much the same way as for initializers: An uninitializer takes a control
argument and is supported with stub procedures in the implementation template
file in a manner similar to initializers.
<P>
Only a single uninitialization method is needed, so<B> SOMObject</B> introduces
the method that provides this function:<B> somDestruct.</B> As with the
default initializer method, a class designer who requires nothing special
in the way of uninitialization need not be concerned about modifying the
default<B> somDestruct</B> method procedure. However, your code will execute
faster if the .idl file overrides<B> somDestruct</B> so that a non-generic
stub-procedure code can be provided for the class. Note that<B> somDestruct
</B>was overridden by "Example1" and "Example2" above No specific IDL modifiers
other than<B> override</B> are required for this.
<P>
Like an initializer template, the stub procedure for<B> somDestruct</B> consists
of two sections: The first section is used by the programmer for performing
any "local" uninitialization that may be required. The second section (which
consists of a single<B> EndDestructor</B> macro invocation) invokes<B> somDestruct
</B>on ancestors The second section must not be modified or removed by the
programmer. It must be the final statement executed in the destructor.
