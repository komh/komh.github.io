<H1>The 'SOMMBeforeAfter' metaclass</H1><!-- entering slot 384 -->
<P>
<B>SOMMBeforeAfter</B> is a metaclass that allows the user to create a class
for which a particular method is invoked<I> before</I> each invocation of
every method, nd for which a second method is invoked<I> after</I> each
invocation.<B> SOMMBeforeAfter</B> defines two methods:<B> sommBeforeMethod
</B>and<B> sommAfterMethod.</B>  These two methods are intended to be overridden
in the child of<B> SOMMBeforeAfter</B> to define the particular "before"
and "after" methods needed for the client application.
<P>
For example, suppose a "Barking" metaclass (a subclass of<B> SOMMBeforeAfter
</B>overrides the<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> and<B> sommAfterMethod</B> with
a method that emits one bark when invoked. Thus, one can create the "BarkingDog"
class, whose instances (such as "Lassie") bark twice when "disturbed" by
a method invocation.

<P>
The<B> SOMMBeforeAfter</B> metaclass is designed to be subclassed; a subclass
(or child) of<B> SOMMBeforeAfter</B> is also a metaclass. The subclass overrides
<B>sommBeforeMethod</B> or<B> sommAfterMethod</B> or both. These (redefned)
methods are invoked before and after any method supported by instances of
the subclass (these methods are called primary methods). That is, they are
invoked before and after methods invoked on the ordinary objects that are
instances of the class objects that are instances of the subclass of<B> SOMMBeforeAfter.
</B>
<P>
The<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> returns a<B> boolean</B> value. This allows
the "before" method to control whether the "after" method and the primary
method get invoked. If<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> returns TRUE, normal processing
occurs. If FALSE is returned, neither the primary method nor the corresponding
<B>sommAfterMethod</B> is invoked. In addition, no more deeply nested before/after
methods are invoked (see "Composition of before/after metaclasses" below).
This facility can be used, for example, to allow a before/after metaclass
to provide secure access to an object. The implication of this convention
is that, if<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> is going to return FALSE, it must do
any post-processing that might otherwise be done in the "after" method.

<P>
Caution:<B> somInit</B> and<B> somFree</B> are among the methods that get
before/after behavior. This implies the following two obligations are imposed
on the programmer of a<B> SOMMBeforeAfter</B> class. First, the implementation
must guard against<B> sommBeforeMethod</B> being called before<B> somInit
</B>has executed, and the object is not yet fully initialized. Second, the
implementation must guard against<B> sommAfterMethod</B> being called after
<B>somFree,</B> at which time the object no longer exists (see the example
"C implementation for 'Barking' metaclass" below).
<P>
The following example shows the IDL needed to create a Barking metaclass.
Just run the appropriate emitter to get an implementation binding, and then
provide the appropriate "before" behavior and "after" behavior.

<B>SOM IDL for 'Barking' metaclass</B>
<PRE>#ifndef Barking_idl
#define Barking_idl

#include &lt;sombacls.idl&gt;
interface  Barking : SOMMBeforeAfter
{
#ifdef __SOMIDL__
implementation
{
  //# Class Modifiers
  filestem = barking;

  //# Method Modifiers
  sommBeforeMethod : override;
  sommAfterMethod : override;
};
#endif /* __SOMIDL__ */
};
#endif  /* Barking_idl */
</PRE>

<P>
The next example shows an implementation of the Barking metaclass in which
no barking occurs when<B> somFree</B> is invoked.
