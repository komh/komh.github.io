<H1>Constant, type, and exception declarations</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
The form of a<B> constant, type</B>, or<B> exception</B> declaration within
the body of an<B> interface</B> declaration is the same as described previously
in this chapter.<B>  Constants</B> and<B> types</B> defined within an<B> interface
</B>for a class are transferred by the SOM Compiler to the binding files
it generates for that class, whereas<B> constants</B> and<B> types</B> defined
outside of an<B> interface</B> are not.
<P>
Global types (such as, those defined outside of an interface and module)
can be emitted by surrounding them with the following<B> #pragmas</B>:
<PRE>   #pragma somemittypes on
        typedef sequence &lt;long,10&gt; vec10;
        exception BAD_FLAG { long ErrCode; char Reason[80]; };
        typedef long long_t;
   #pragma somemittypes off
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Types, constants,</B> and<B> exceptions</B> defined in a parent class
are also accessible to the child class. References to them, however, must
be unambiguous. Potential ambiguities can be resolved by prefacing a name
with the name of the class that defines it, separated by the characters
"::" as illustrated below:
<PRE>   MyParentClass::myType
</PRE>

<P>
The child class can redefine any of the<B> type, constant,</B> and<B> exception
</B>names that have been inherited, although this is not advised. The derived
class cannot, however, redefine<B> attributes</B> or<B> methods</B>. It
can only replace the implementation of<B> methods</B> through overriding
(as in example 3 of the Tutorial). To refer to a<B> constant, type,</B> or
<B>exception</B> "name" defined by a parent class and redefined by "class-name,"
use the "parent-name::name" syntax as before.
<P>
Note: A name reference such as MyParentClass::myType required in IDL syntax
is equivalent to MyParentClass_myType in C/C++. For a full discussion of
name recognition in SOM, see "Scoping and name resolution" later in this
chapter.
