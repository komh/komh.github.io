<H1>A note about metaclass programming</H1><!-- entering slot 382 -->
<P>
SOM metaclasses are carefully constructed so that they compose (see Section
8.1 below). If you need to create a metaclass, you can introduce new class
methods, and new class variables, but you should not override any of the
methods introduced by<B> SOMClass.</B> If you need more than this, request
access to the experimental Cooperative metaclass used to implement the Metaclass
Framework metaclasses described in this chapter.
