<H1>Server implementation definition</H1><!-- entering slot 270 -->
<P>
A<I> server's implementation definition</I> must be registered in the<I> Implementation
Repository</I> before a server can be used. When a client attempts to invoke
a method on a remote object, DSOM consults the Implementation Repository
to find the location of the target object's server.
<P>
An implementation definition is represented by an object of class<B> ImplementationDef,
</B>whose attributes describe a server's ID, user-assigned alias, host name,
program pathname, the class of its server object, whether or not it is multi-threaded,
and so forth. Implementation IDs uniquely identify servers within the Implementation
Repository, and are used as keys into the Implementation Repository when
retrieving the<B> ImplementationDef</B> for a particular server.
<P>
It is possible to change the implementation characteristics of a server,
even to the point of using a completely different server program on another
machine (with Workgroup DSOM). Thus, the implementation ID identifies a
logical server, and the<B> ImplementationDef</B> describes the current implementation
of that logical server.
<P>
See the topic "Registering Servers and Classes" in section 6.6 for details
on server registration. Two registration methods are described: "manual,"
(via the<B> regimpl</B>, the<B> wregimpl,</B> or the<B> pregimpl</B> utility)
and "programmatic,"<B> ImplRepository</B> methods.
<P>
When a server is initialized, it must retrieve a copy of its<B> ImplementationDef</B>,
and keep it in a global variable (<B>SOMD_ImplDefObject</B>).<I> This variable
is used by the DSOM run time</I>. (Client-only programs may leave the<B> SOMD_ImplDefObject
</B>variable set to NULL.)
