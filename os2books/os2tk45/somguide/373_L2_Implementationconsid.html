<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Only the AF_INET address family must be supported.
That is, the DSOM, Replication, and Event Manager frameworks all use Internet
addresses and port numbers to refer to specific sockets.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On OS/2, the SOMobjects run-time libraries were built
using the C Set/2 32-bit compiler. If the underlying subclass implementation
uses a 16-bit subroutine library, conversion of the method call arguments
may be required. (This mapping of arguments is often referred to as "thunking.")
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Sockets</B> subclasses to be used in multi-threaded
environments should be made thread-safe. That is, it is possible that concurrent
threads may make calls on the (single)<B> Sockets</B> object, so data structures
must be protected within critical regions, as appropriate.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Valid values for the<B> serrno</B> attribute are defined
in the file<B> soms.h</B>. The subclass implementation should map local
error numbers into the appropriate corresponding<B> Sockets</B> error numbers.
