<P>
SOM uses three routines that manage the loading and unloading of class libraries
(referred to here as DLLs). These routines are called by the<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B> as it dynamically loads and registers classes. If appropriate, the
rules that govern the loading and unloading of DLLs can be modified, by
replacing these functions with alternative implementations.
