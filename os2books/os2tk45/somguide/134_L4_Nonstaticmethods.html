<H1>Nonstatic methods</H1><!-- entering slot 164 -->
<P>
These methods are similar in concept to C++ nonstatic member functions (that
is, C++ functions that are not virtual member functions and are not static
member functions). Nonstatic methods are normally invoked using offset resolution,
but all three kinds of method resolution are applicable  to nonstatic methods.
When the SOMobjects language bindings are used to implement a class, the
SOM IDL<B> nonstatic</B> modifier is used to indicate that a given method
is nonstatic.
<P>
Like static methods, nonstatic methods are given individual positions in
method tables. However, nonstatic methods cannot be overridden. Instead,
descendants of a class that introduces a nonstatic method can use the SOM
IDL<B> reintroduce</B> modifier to "hide" the original nonstatic method
with another (nonstatic or static) method of the same name. When a nonstatic
method is resolved, selection of the specific method procedure is determined
by the interface that is used to access the method.
