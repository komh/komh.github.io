<P>
One of the principal advantages of SOM is that it makes "black box" (or
binary) reusability possible. Consequently, SOM classes are frequently packaged
and distributed as class libraries. A class library  holds the actual implementation
of one or more classes and can be dynamically loaded and unloaded as needed
by applications. Importantly, class libraries can also be replaced independently
of the applications  that use them and, provided that the class implementor
observes simple SOM guidelines for preserving binary compatibility, can
evolve and expand over time.
