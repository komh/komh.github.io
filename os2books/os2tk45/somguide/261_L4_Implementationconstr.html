<H1>Implementation constraints</H1><!-- entering slot 299 -->
<P>
The generic server program<B> (somdsvr)</B>, the<B> SOMOA</B>, and the<B> SOMDServer
</B>make it easy to use SOM classes with DSOM. However, if there are any
parts of the class implementation that were written expecting a single-process
environment, the class may have to be modified to behave properly in a client/server
environment. Some common implementation practices to<I> avoid</I> are listed
below<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Printing to standard output</B>. Any text printed
by a method will appear at the server, as opposed to the client. In fact,
the server may not be attached to a text display device or window, so the
text may be lost completely. It is preferred that any textual output generated
by a method be returned as an output string.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Passing textual output between the client program and the
called method via an "inout string" parameter is<I> strongly</I> discouraged.
As discussed in the CORBA 1.1 specification (page 94), the size of the output
string is constrained by the size of the input string. If there was no input
string value, the size of the output string would be constrained to 0 bytes.
Instead, it is preferred that textual data be returned either as an output
string (DSOM provides the storage), or by passing a character array buffer
(client provides the storage).<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Creating
and deleting objects.</B> Methods that create or delete objects may have
to be modified if the created objects are intended to be remote. The calls
to create local objects are different than the calls to create remote objects.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Using pointers to client-allocated
memory in instance variables.</B> Consider the following example: A class
has a method that accepts a pointer to a data value created by the client
(e.g., a string or a struct), and simply stores the pointer in an instance
variable or attribute. However, in DSOM, the called method is passed a pointer
to a copy of the value (in the request message body), but the copy is freed
at the end of the request. If the data value is meant to persist between
requests, the object is responsible for making its own copy of it. (The
implementation of the "_set_printerName" method in the topic "Wrapping a
printer API" later in this section is an example of a method performing
such a copy.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B>Using "procedure"
methods.</B> Methods having the<B> procedure</B> SOM IDL modifier cannot
be invoked remotely using DSOM.  This is because these "methods" are called
directly, rather than by the normal method resolution mechanisms on which
DSOM relies.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to those coding practices which simply do not "port" to a distributed
environment, there are a few other restrictions that are imposed by DSOM's
(current) implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Using parameter types not supported by DSOM.</B> DSOM
can make remote invocations only of methods whose parameter types are among
the following IDL types:  basic types<B> short, long, unsigned short, unsigned
long,float, double, char, boolean, octet), enum struct, union, sequence,
string, array, any,</B> and<B> object</B> (an interface name, designating
a pointer to an object that supports that interface).  The members of a
<B>struct, union, sequence,</B> or<B> array,</B> and the value of any<B> any,
</B>must<!-- entering slot 300 --> also be from the above list of supported
DSOM types.
<P>
In addition to the above types, DSOM also supports method parameters of
type<B> pointer</B> to one of the above types (for example,<B>  long*</B>).
 Pointers to pointers are not supported, however, and pointers embedded
within one of the above types (for example, a pointer within a struct) are
not supported.  The<B> "void*"</B> type is also not supported.  Currently,
DSOM has the limitation that NULL pointer values cannot be returned as<B> inout
</B>or<B> out</B> method arguments, although it is expected that this limitation
will be addressed in the future release.
<P>
Types declared as SOMFOREIGN types are not currently supported by DSOM.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Packing of structures used as method arguments.
</B>If a compiler option is used to pack or optimize storage of<B> structs
</B>(including reordering of struct members) or<B> unions</B>, it is important
to indicate the exact alignment of the structures using<I> alignment modifiers
</I>expressed in the implementation section of the IDL file. This information
must then be updated in the Interface Repository.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some applications may need to associate specific identification information
with an object, to support application-specific object location or activation.
In that case, an application server should create object references explicitly,
using the<B> create</B> or<B> create_constant</B> method in<B> SOMOA</B>.
A logical place to put these calls is in a subclass of<B> SOMDServer,</B> as
it is the server object that is responsible for producing/activating objects
from object references.
