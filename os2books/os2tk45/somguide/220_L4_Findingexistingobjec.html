<H1>Finding existing objects</H1><!-- entering slot 257 -->
<P>
The<B> SOMDObjectMgr</B> and<B> SOMDServer</B> classes support the methods
described above, which allow clients to create objects in servers. However,
it is also likely that clients will want to find and use objects that have
already been created, usually by the servers that implement them. For example,
a print service will create printer objects, and must then export them to
clients. In that case, the calls to<B> somdNewObject</B> or<B> somdCreateObj
</B>would be replaced with other "lookup" calls on some directory (server)
object which would take an object name or identifier and return a proxy
to a corresponding remote object. Likewise, the server that owns the object
would register the exported object in the directory.
<P>
It is important to understand that DSOM does not provide a directory service
such as the one described. But such a directory object could be implemented
by the application, where a table or collection object maps object names
to proxies. The string IDs for the proxies in the directory object could
be saved using a file (as above) or a persistent object (via the Persistence
Framework of SOMobject Developer Toolkit). A directory server implemented
using DSOM could be used to share the directory among processes.
<P>
Upon a lookup call, the directory server could find the corresponding proxy
(or its string ID) in the directory, and return it to the caller.
