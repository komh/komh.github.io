<H1>Providing 'alignment' information</H1><!-- entering slot 377 -->
<P>
In addition to the parameters in the<B> TypeCode</B>s that describe each
type, a SOM-unique extension to the<B> TypeCode</B> functionality allows
each<B> TypeCode</B> to carry alignment information as a "hidden" parameter.
Use the<B> TypeCode_alignment</B> function to access the alignment value.
The alignment value is a short integer that should evenly divide any memory
address where an instance of the type will occur.
<P>
If no alignment information is provided in your IDL source files, all<B> TypeCode</B>s
carry default alignment information. The default alignment for a type is
the natural boundary for the type, based on the natural boundary for the
basic types of which it may be composed. This information can vary from
one hardware platform to another. The<B>  TypeCode</B> will contain the
default alignment information appropriate to the platform where it was defined.

<P>
To provide alignment information for the types and instances of types in
your IDL source file, use the "align=N" modifier, where N is your specified
alignment. Use standard modifier syntax of the SOM Compiler to attach the
alignment information to a particular element in the IDL source file.<B></B> In
the following example,  align=1 (that is, unaligned or no alignment) is
attached to the struct "abc" and to one particular instance of struct "def"
(the instance data item "y").
<PRE>interface i {
    struct abc {
        long a;
        char b;
        long c;
    };
    struct def {
        char l;
        long m;
    };

    void foo ();

    implementation {

    //# instance data
        abc x;
        def y;
        def z;

    //# alignment modifiers
        abc: align=1;
        y: align=1;
    };
};
</PRE>

<P>
Be aware that assigning the required alignment information to a type does
<I>not </I> guarantee that instances of that type will actually be aligned
as indicated. To ensure that, you must find a way to instruct your compiler
to provide the desired alignment. In practice, this can be difficult except
in simple cases. Most compilers can be instructed to treat all data as aligned
(that is, default alignment) or as unaligned, by using a compile-time option
or #pragma. The more important consideration is to make certain that the
<B>TypeCode</B>s going into the Interface Repository actually reflect the
alignment that your compiler provides. This way, when programs (such as
the DSOM Framework) need to interpret the layout of data during their execution,
they will be able to accurately map your data structures. This happens automatically
when using the normal default alignment.
<P>
If you wish to use unaligned instance data when implementing a class, place
an "unattached" align=1 modifier in the implementation section. An unattached
align=N modifier is presumed to pertain to the class's instance data structure,
and will by implication be attached to all of the instance data items.
<P>
When designing your own public types, be aware that the best practice of
all (and the one that offers the best opportunity for language neutrality)
is to lay out your types carefully so that it will make no difference whether
they are compiled as aligned or unaligned!
