and improved performance for both SOM and DSOM. In addition, the Toolkit
now includes support for DirectToSOM (DTS) C++ compilers. New metaclasses
in the Metaclass Framework allow class implementors to define classes that
automatically possess certain convenience facilities. Also, TCP/IP support
is available for Windows users, and OS/2 users can choose 32-bit TCP/IP.
