<H1>Running the DSOM daemon (somdd)</H1><!-- entering slot 323 -->
<P>
To run a DSOM application, the DSOM daemon,<B> somdd,</B> must be started:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On AIX or OS/2, the daemon can be started manually
from the command line, or could be started automatically from a start-up
script run at boot time. It may be run in the background with the commands
<B>somdd&amp;</B> on AIX, and<B> start somdd</B> on OS/2. (The<B>somdd</B> command
has the following syntax:
<PRE><B>somdd [-q]</B>
</PRE>

<P>
where the optional<B> -q</B> flag signifies "quiet" mode.  By default,<B> somdd
</B>will produce a" ready" message when the DSOM daemon is ready to process
requests, and it will produce diagnostic messages as errors are encountered
if the SOMDDEBUG environment variable is set to 1. In quiet mode, however,
the "ready" message will not appear, and diagnostic messages will not appear
even if SOMDEBUG is set. Alternatively, if the SOMDMESSAGELOG environment
variable is set, diagnostic error messages will be sent directly to the
specified message log file, regardless of whether the<B> -q</B> flag is
specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On Windows, the daemon can be started with the<B> DSOM
Daemon</B> icon in the SOM icon group or started in Windows from the Run
option of the file menu.  The<B> DSOM Daemon</B> icon will change colors
to indicate that the daemon is ready, after which client and server programs
can be started.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> somdd</B> daemon is responsible for "binding" a client process to
a server process and will activate the desired server if necessary. The
binding procedure is such that the client will consult the Implementation
Repository to find out which machine contains a desired server, and will
then contact the DSOM daemon on the server's machine to retrieve the server's
communications address (a port). Servers are activated dynamically as separate
processes.
