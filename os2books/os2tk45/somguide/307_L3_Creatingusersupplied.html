<H1>Creating user-supplied proxies</H1><!-- entering slot 350 -->
<P>
DSOM uses a proxy object in the client's address space to represent the
remote object. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the proxy object encapsulates
the operations necessary to forward and invoke methods on the remote object
and return the results. By default, proxy generation is done automatically
by the DSOM run time. However, if desired, the programmer can cause a user-supplied
proxy class to be loaded instead of letting the run time dynamically generate
a default proxy class. User-supplied proxies can be useful in specialized
circumstances when local processing or data caching is desired.
<P>
To build a user-supplied proxy class, it is necessary to understand a bit
about how dynamic proxy classes are constructed by the DSOM run time. The
DSOM run time constructs a proxy class by creating an instance of a class
that inherits the interface and implementation of<B> SOMDClientProxy,</B> and
the interface (but not the implementation) of the target class. The methods
in the interface of the target object are all overridden to call the<B> somDispatch
</B>method (For more details, see "Object references and proxy objects"
in section 6.8.)
<P>
Every SOM object contains the<B> somDispatch</B> method, inherited from
<B>SOMObject.</B> This method is used to dynamically dispatch a method on
an object, and can be overridden with application-specific dispatching mechanisms.
In<B> SOMDClientProxy,</B> the<B> somDispatch</B> method is overridden to
forward method calls to the corresponding remote target object.
<P>
So, in effect, when a method is called on a default proxy object created
by the DSOM run time, it redispatches the method to the remote object using
DSOM's version of<B> somDispatch.</B>
<P>
Below is a simple example of a user-supplied proxy class. In this particular
example, the proxy object maintains a local, unshared copy of an attribute
("attribute_long") defined in the remote object ("Foo"), while forwarding
method invocations ("method1") on to the remote object. The result is that,
when multiple clients are talking to the same remote "Foo" object, each
client has a local copy of the attribute but all clients share the "Foo"
object's implementation of "method1".
<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is important to understand that simply setting the attribute
in one client's proxy does not affect the value of the attribute in other
proxies. Maintaining consistency of the cached data values, if desired,
is the responsibility of the user-supplied proxy class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Following is the IDL file for the "Foo" class:
<PRE>
// foo.idl


#include &lt;somdtype.idl&gt;
#include &lt;somobj.idl&gt;


interface Foo : SOMObject
{
        string  method1(out string a, inout long b,
                        in ReferenceData c);
        attribute long attribute_long;


  implementation
  {
     releaseorder: method1, _set_attribute_long,
                   _get_attribute_long;
     dllname="foo.dll";
     somDefaultInit: override;
  };
};
</PRE>

<P>
The user-supplied proxy class is created by using multiple inheritance between
<B>SOMDClientProxy</B> and the target object (in this case "Foo"). Thus,
the IDL file for the user-supplied proxy class "Foo__Proxy" (note the two
underscores) is as follows:
<PRE>
// fooproxy.idl


#include &lt;somdcprx.idl&gt;
#include &lt;foo.idl&gt;


interface Foo__Proxy : SOMDClientProxy, Foo
{
  implementation
  {
     dllname="fooproxy.dll";
     method1: override;
  };
};
</PRE>

<P>
When a dynamic proxy class is created by the DSOM run time, the methods
inherited from the target class are automatically overridden to use somDispatch.
When you build a user-supplied proxy, you need to do this explicitly. This
is why "method1" is overridden in the implementation section of the "fooproxy.idl"
file.
<P>
The implementation of "method1", which was added to the template produced
by the SOM Compiler, simply calls the<B> somDispatch</B> method on "somSelf"
Because "Foo__Proxy" has inherited the implementation of<B> SOMDClientProxy,
</B>calling<B> somDispatch</B> within "method1" sends the method to the
remote "Foo" object.
<PRE>/* fooproxy.c */

#include &lt;somdtype.h&gt;
#include &lt;fooproxy.ih&gt;

SOM_<!-- entering slot 351 -->Scope string  SOMLINK method1(Foo__Proxy somSelf,
                                  Environment *ev,
                                  string* a, long* b,
                                  ReferenceData* c)
{
    string ret_str;
    somId  methodId;


/*  Foo__ProxyData *somThis = Foo__ProxyGetData(somSelf); */
    Foo__ProxyMethodDebug("Foo__Proxy","method1");


    /* redispatch method, remotely */
    methodId = somIdFromString("method1");
    _somDispatch(somSelf, (void**)&amp;ret_str,
                 methodId, somSelf, ev, a, b, c);
    SOMFree(methodId);


    return ret_str;
}
</PRE>

<P>
In summary, to build a user-supplied proxy class:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create the .idl file with the proxy class inheriting
from both<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> and from the target class. Important: The
user-supplied proxy class must be named "&lt;targetClassName&gt;_ _Proxy"
(with two underscores in the name) and<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> must be the
<I>first class</I> in the list of parent classes; for example,
<PRE>
        interface Foo_ _Proxy : SOMDClientProxy, Foo

</PRE>

<P>
Putting<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> first ensures that its version of<B> somDispatch
</B>will be used to dispatch remote method calls.
<P>
In the implementation section of the .idl file, override all methods that
are to be invoked on the target class. Do not override methods that are
to be invoked on the local proxy.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Compile the .idl file. Be sure the Interface Repository
gets updated with the .idl file. In the implementation file, for each overridden
method, call<B> somDispatch</B> with the method name and parameters passed
into the overridden method. If the proxy class provides an implementation
for the<B> somInit</B> or<B> somDefaultInit</B> method, then it is important
to ensure that calling that method more than once on the same proxy object
has no negative effect.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Build the DLL and place it the LIBPATH for AIX and
OS/2, or listed in PATH for Windows. Before creating the default proxy,
the DSOM run time checks the LIBPATH for a DLL containing the class named
"&lt;targetClassName&gt;_<B> _Proxy"</B> If such a DLL is found, DSOM loads
it instead of dynamically generating a proxy class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
