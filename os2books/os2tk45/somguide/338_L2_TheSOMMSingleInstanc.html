<H1>The 'SOMMSingleInstance' Metaclass</H1><!-- entering slot 387 -->
<P>
Sometimes it is necessary to define a class for which only one instance
can be created. This is easily accomplished with the<B> SOMMSingleInstance
</B>metaclass. Suppose the class "Collie" is an instance of<B> SOMMSingleInstance.
</B>The first call to<B> CollieNew</B> creates the one possible instance
of "Collie"; hence, subsequent calls to<B> CollieNew</B> return the first
(and only) instance.
<P>
Any class whose metaclass is<B> SOMMSingleInstance</B> gets this requisite
behavior; nothing further needs to be done. The first instance created is
always returned by the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> maro.
<P>
Alternatively, the method<B> sommGetSingleInstance</B> does the same thing
as the &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> macro. This method invoked on
a class object (for example, "Collie") is useful because the call site explicitly
shows that something special is occurring and that a new object is not necessarily
being created. For this reason, one might prefer the second form of creating
a single-instance object to the first.
<P>
Instances of<B> SOMMSingleInstance</B> keep a count of the number of times
<B>somNew</B> and<B> sommGetSingleInstance</B> are invoked. Each invocation
of<B> somFree</B> decrements this count. An invocation of<B> somFree</B> does
not actually free the single instance until the count reaches zero.
<P>
<B>SOMMSingleInstance</B> overrides<B> somRenew, somRenewNoInit, somRenewNoInitNoZero,
</B>and<B> somRenewNoZero</B> so that a proxy is created in the space indicated
in the<B> somRenew*</B> call. This proxy redispatches all methods to the
single instance, which is always allocated in heap storage. Note that all
of these methods<B> (somRenew*)</B> increment the reference count; therefore,
<B>somFree</B> should be called on these objects, too. In this case,<B> somFree
</B>decrements the reference and frees the single instance (and, of course,
takes no action with respect to the storage indicated in the original<B> somRenew*
</B>call).
<P>
If a class is an instance of<B> SOMMSingleInstance,</B> all of its subclasse
are also instances of<B> SOMMSingleInstance.</B> Be aware that this also
means that each subclass is allowed to have only a single instance. (This
may seem obvious. However, it is a common mistake to create a framework
class that must have a single instance, while at the same time expecting
users of the framework to subclass the single instance class. The result
is that two single-instance objects are created: one for the framework class
and one for the subclass. One technique that can mitigate this scenario
is based on the use of<B> somSubstituteClass.</B> In this case, the creator
of the subclass must substitute the subclass for the framework class - before
the instance of the framework class is created.)
