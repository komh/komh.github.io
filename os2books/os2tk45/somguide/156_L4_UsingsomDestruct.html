<H1>Using 'somDestruct'</H1><!-- entering slot 190 -->
<P>
It is rarely necessary to invoke the<B> somDestruct</B> method explicitly
This is because object uninitialization is normally done just before freeing
an object's storage, and the mechanisms provided by SOMobjects for this
purpose will automatically invoke<B> somDestruct.</B> For example, if an
object were created using<B> somNew</B> or<B> somNewNoInit</B>, or by using
a convenience macro provided by the C languag bindings, then the<B> somFree
</B>method can be invoked on the object to delete the object. This automatically
calls<B> somDestruct</B> before freeing storage.
<P>
C++ users can simply use the<B> delete</B> operator provided by the C++
bindings. This destructor calls<B> somDestruct</B> before the C++<B> delete
</B> operator frees the object's storage.
<P>
On the other hand, if an object is initially created by allocating memory
in some special way and subsequently some<B> somRenew</B> methods are used,
<B>somFree</B> (or C++ delete) is probably not appropriate. Thus, the<B> somDestruct
</B>method should be explicitly called to uninitialize the object before
freeing memory.
