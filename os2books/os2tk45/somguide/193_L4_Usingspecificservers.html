<H1>Using specific servers</H1><!-- entering slot 230 -->
<P>
In DSOM, the process that manages a target object is called the object's
<I>server.</I> Servers are implemented as programs that use SOM classes.
 Server implementations are registered with DSOM in an Implementation Repository.
The<I> Implementation Repository</I> is a database queried by clients in
order to find desired servers, and queried by DSOM in order to activate
those servers upon demand.
<P>
The example above placed no constraints on the DSOM Object Manager as to
where the remote "Stack" object should be created. The<B> somdNewObject
</B>call creates a remote object of a specified class in an arbitrary server
that implements that class. However, the DSOM Object Manager provides methods
for finding specific servers.
<P>
For example, the client program above can be modified slightly to find a
specific server named "StackServer", which has already been registered in
DSOM's Implementation Repository.  (Note that the programmer knew or discovered
that the "StackServer" server implementation supports the "Stack" class.)
 The highlighted lines below show the changes that were made:
<PRE>#include &lt;somd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stack.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        Stack stk;
        Environment e;
        <B>SOMDServer server;</B>

        SOM_InitEnvironment(&amp;e);
        SOMD_Init(&amp;e);

        <B>server =
          _somdFindServerByName(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;e, "StackServer");
        stk = _somdCreateObj(server, &amp;e, "Stack", "");</B>

        _push(stk,&amp;e,100);
        _push(stk,&amp;e,200);
        _pop(stk,&amp;e);
        if (!_empty(stk,&amp;e)) somPrintf("Top: %d\n", _top(stk,&amp;e));

        <B>_somdDeleteObj(server, &amp;e, stk);
        _somdReleaseObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;e, stk);
        _somdReleaseObject(SOMD_ObjectMgr, &amp;e, server);</B>
        SOMD_Uninit(&amp;e);
        SOM_UninitEnvironment(&amp;e);

        return(0);
}
</PRE>

<P>
This version of the program replaces the<B> somdNewObject</B> operation
with calls to<B> somdFindServerByName</B> and<B> somdCreateObj</B>. The
<B>somdFindServerByName</B> method consults the Implementation Repository
to find the DSOM server implementation whose name is "StackServer", and
creates a<I> server proxy,</I> which provides a connection to that server.
Every DSOM server process has a<I> server object</I> that defines methods
to assist in the creation and management of objects in that server. Server
objects must be instances of<B> SOMDServer</B> or one of its subclasses.
The<B> somdFindServerByName</B> returns a proxy to the<B> SOMDServer</B> object
in the named server.
<P>
Once the client has the server proxy, it can create and destroy objects
in that server. The<B> somdCreateObj</B> call creates an object of the class
"Stack" in the server named "StackServer".
<P>
To free the remote "Stack" object, the example shows a<B> somdDeleteObj
</B>request on the stack object's server. Next,<B> somdReleaseObject</B> requests
are made on the DSOM Object Manager, to free the stack proxy and the server
proxy in the client. (Note that these three calls are equivalent to the
<B>somdDestroyObject</B> call in the previous example.)
