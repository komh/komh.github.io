<H1>Scooping and name resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 128 -->
<P>
A .idl file forms a<B> naming scope</B> (or<B> scope</B>).<B> Modules</B>,
<B>interface</B> statements,<B>  structures</B>,<B> unions</B>,<B> methods</B>,
and<B> exceptions</B> form<B> nested scopes</B>. An identifier can only
be defined once in a particular scope. Identifiers can be redefined in nested
scopes.
<P>
Names can be used in an unqualified form within a scope, and the name will
be resolved by successively searching the enclosing scopes. Once an unqualified
name is defined in an enclosing scope, that name cannot be redefined.
<P>
Fully qualified names are of the form:
<P>
<I>scoped-name</I><I>::</I><I>identifier</I>
<P>
For example, method name "meth" defined within interface "Test" of module
"M1" would have the fully qualified name:
<PRE>  M1::Test::meth
</PRE>

<P>
A qualified name is resolved by first resolving the "scoped-name" to a particular
scope S, then locating the definition of "identifier" within that scope.
Enclosing scopes of S are not searched.
<P>
Qualified names of the form:
<P>
<I>::</I><I>identifier</I>
<P>
These names are resolved by locating the definition of "identifier" within
the smallest enclosing module.
<P>
Every name defined in an IDL specification is given a global name, constructed
as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Before the SOM Compiler scans an .idl file, the name
of the current<I> root</I> and the name of the current<I> scope</I> are
empty. As each module is encountered, the string "::" and the module name
are appended to the name of the current root. At the end of the module,
they are removed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->As each interface, struct, union, or exception definition
is encountered, the string "::" and the associated name are appended to
the name of the current scope. At the end of the definition, they are removed.
While parameters of a method declaration are processed, a new unnamed scope
is entered so that parameter names can duplicate other identifiers.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The global name of an IDL definition is then the concatenation
of the current root, the current scope, a "::", and the local name for the
definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The names of types, constants, and exceptions defined by the parents of
a class are accessible in the child class. References to these names must
be unambiguous. Ambiguities can be resolved  by using a scoped name (prefacing
the name with the name of the class that defines it and the characters "::",
as in "parent-class::identifier). Scope names can also be used to refer
to a constant, type, or exception name defined by a parent class but redefined
by the child class.
