<H1>Compiling and linking</H1><!-- entering slot 68 -->
<P>
This section describes how to compile and link C and C++ client programs.
Compiling and linking a client program with a SOM class is done in one of
two ways, depending on how the class is packaged.
<P>
Note: If you are building an application that uses a combination of C and
C++ compiled object modules, then the C++ linker must be used to link them.

<P>
<U><I>If the class is not packaged as a library</I></U> (that is, the client
program has the implementation source code for the class, as in the examples
given in the SOM IDL tutorial), then the client program can be compiled
together with the class implementation file as follows. (This assumes that
the client program and the class are both implemented in the same language,
C or C++. If this is not the case, then each module must be compiled separately
to produce an object file and the resulting object files linked together
to form an executable.)
<P>
In the following examples, the environment variable<B> SOMBASE</B> refers
to the directory in which SOM has been installed. The examples also assume
that the header files and the import library for the "Hello" class reside
in the "include" and "lib" directories where SOM has been installed.  If
this is not the case, additional path information should be supplied for
these files. For client program "main" and class "Hello":
<P>
<B>Under AIX</B>, for<B> C</B> programmers:
<PRE>   &gt; xlc -I. -I$SOMBASE/include main.c hello.c -L$SOMBASE/lib -lsomtk \
         -o main
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Under AIX</B>, for<B> C++</B> programmers:
<PRE>   &gt; xlC -I. -I$SOMBASE/include main.C hello.C -L$SOMBASE/lib -lsomtk \
         -o main
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Under OS/2</B>, for<B> C</B> programmers:
<PRE>   &gt; set LIB=%SOMBASE%\lib;%LIB%
   &gt; icc -I. -I%SOMBASE%\include main.c hello.c somtk.lib
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Under OS/2</B>, for<B> C++</B> programmers:
<PRE>   &gt; set LIB=%SOMBASE%\lib;%LIB%
   &gt; icc -I. -I%SOMBASE%\include main.cpp hello.cpp somtk.lib
</PRE>

<P>
<U><I>If the class is packaged as a class library</I></U>, then the client
program, "main", is compiled as above, except that the class implementation
file is not part of the compilation. Instead, the "import library" provided
with the class library is used to resolve the symbolic references that appear
in "main". For example, to compile the C client program "main.c" that uses
class "Hello":
<P>
<B>Under AIX</B>:
<PRE>   &gt; xlc -I. -I$SOMBASE/include main.c -lc -L$SOMBASE/lib -lsomtk \
         -lhello -o main
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Under OS/2</B>:
<PRE>   &gt; set LIB=%SOMBASE%\lib;%LIB%
   &gt; icc -I. -I%SOMBASE%\include main.c somtk.lib hello.lib
</PRE>
