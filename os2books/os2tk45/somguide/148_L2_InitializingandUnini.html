<H1>Initializing and Uninitializing Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 179 -->
<P>
This section discusses the initialization and uninitialization of SOM objects.
Subsequent topics introduce the methods and capabilities that the SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit provides to facilitate this.
<P>
<I>Object creation</I> is the act that enables the execution of methods
on an object. In SOM, this means storing a pointer to a method table into
a word of memory. This single act converts raw memory into an (uninitialized)
SOM object that starts at the location of the method table pointer.
<P>
<I>Object initialization,</I> on the other hand, is a separate activity
from object creation in SOM. Initialization is a capability supported by
certain methods available on an object. An object's class determines the
implementation of the methods available on the object, and thus determines
its initialization behavior.
<P>
The instance variables encapsulated by a newly created object must be brought
into a consistent state before the object can be used. This is the purpose
of<I> initialization methods.</I> Because, in general, every ancestor of
an object's class contributes instance data to an object, it is appropriate
that each of these ancestors contribute to the initialization of the object.

<P>
SOM thus recognizes<I> initializers</I> as a special kind of method. One
advantage of this approach is that special metaclasses are not required
for defining constructors (class methods) that take arguments. Furthermore,
a class can define multiple initializer methods, thus enabling its different
objects to be initialized supporting different characteristics or capabilities.
This results in simpler designs and more efficient programs.
<P>
The SOMobjects Toolkit provides an overall framework that class designers
can easily exploit in order to implement default or customized initialization
of SOM objects. This framework is fully supported by the SOM Toolkit emitters
that produce the implementation template file. The following sections describe
the declaration, implementation, and use of initializer (and uninitializer)
methods.
<P>
<B>Important:</B> All code written prior to SOMobjects Release 2.1 using
documented guidelines for the earlier initialization approach based on the
somInit method (as well as all existing class binaries) continues to be
fully supported and useful.
