<H1>Managing IRs via the SOMIR environment variable</H1><!-- entering slot 367 -->
<P>
The SOMobjects Toolkit offers a more flexible approach to managing interface
repositories. The SOMIR environment variable can reference an ordered list
of separate IR files, which process from left to right. Taken as a whole,
however, this gives the appearance of a single, logical interface repository.
A programmer accessing the contents of "the interface repository" through
the SOM Interface Repository framework would not be aware of the division
of information across separate files. It would seem as though all of the
objects resided in a single interface repository file.
<P>
A typical way to utilize this capability is as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The first (leftmost) Interface Repository in the SOMIR
list would be "som.ir". This file contains the basic interfaces and types
needed in all SOM classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The second file in the list might contain interface
definitions that are used globally across a particular enterprise.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A third interface repository file would contain definitions
that are unique to a particular department, and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The final interface repository in the list should
be set aside to hold the interfaces needed for the project currently under
development.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Developers working on different projects would each set their SOMIR environment
variables to hold slightly different lists. For the most part, the leftmost
portions of these lists would be the same, but the rightmost interface repositories
would differ. When any given developer is ready to share his/her interface
definitions with other people outside of the immediate work group, that
person's interface repository can be promoted to inclusion in the master
list.
<P>
With this arrangement of IR files, the more stable repositories are found
at the left end of the list. For example, a developer should never need
to make any significant changes to "som.ir", because these interfaces are
defined by IBM and would only change with a new release of the SOMobjects
Toolkit.
<P>
The Interface Repository Framework only permits updates in the rightmost
file of the SOMIR interface repository list. That is, when the SOM Compiler
-u flag is used to update the Interface Repository, only the final file
on the IR list will be affected. The information in all preceding interface
repository files is treated as "read only".  Therefore, to change the definition
of an interface in one of the more global interface repository files, a
developer must overtly construct a special SOMIR list that omits all subsequent
(that is, further to the right) interface repository files, or else petition
the owner of that interface to make the change.
<P>
It is important the the rightmost filename in the SOMIR interface repository
list not appear elsewhere in the list.  For Example, the following setting
for SOMIR:
<PRE>     %SOMBASE5\ETC\SOM.IR;SOM.IR;C:\IR\COMPANY.IR;SOM.IR</PRE>

<P>
would cause problems when attempting to update the SOM.IR file, because
SOM.IR appears twice in the list.
<P>
Here is an example that illustrates the use of multiple IR files with the
SOMIR environment variable. In this example, the SOMBASE environment variable
represents the directory in which the SOMobjects Toolkit files have been
installed. Only the "myown.ir" interface repository file will be updated
with the interfaces found in files "myclass1.idl", "myclass2.idl", and "myclass3.idl".

<P>
For OS/2:
<PRE>set <!-- entering slot 368 -->BASE_IRLIST=%SOMBASE%\IR\SOM.IR;C:\IR\COMPANY.IR;C:\IR\DEPT10.IR
set SOMIR=%BASE_IRLIST%;D:\MYOWN.IR
set SMINCLUDE=.;%SOMBASE%\INCLUDE;C:\COMPANY\INCLUDE;C:\DEPT10\INCLUDE
sc -usir myclass1
sc -usir myclass2
sc -usir myclass3
</PRE>

<P>
For AIX:
<PRE>export BASE_IRLIST=$SOMBASE/ir/som.ir:/usr/local/ir/comany.ir:\
    /usr/local/ir/dept10.ir
export SOMIR=$BASE_IRLIST:~/myown.ir
export SMINCLUDE=.:$SOMBASE/INCLUDE:/usr/local/company/include:\
    /usr/local/dept10/include
sc -usir myclass1
sc -usir myclass2
sc -usir myclass3
</PRE>
