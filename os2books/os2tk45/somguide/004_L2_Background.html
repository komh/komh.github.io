<B>Object-oriented programming</B> (or<B> OOP</B>) is an important new programming
technology that offers expanded opportunities for software reuse and extensibility.
 Object-oriented programming shifts the emphasis of software development
away from functional decomposition and toward the recognition of units (called
objects) that encapsulate both code and data.  As a result, programs become
easier to maintain and enhance. Object-oriented programs are typically more
impervious to the "ripple effects" of subsequent design changes than their
non-object-oriented counterparts. This, in turn, leads to improvements in
programmer productivity.
<P>
Despite its promise, penetration of object-oriented technology to major
commercial software products has progressed slowly because of certain obstacles.
 This is particularly true of products that offer only a binary programming
interface to their internal object classes (Example: products that do not
allow access to source code).
<P>
The first obstacle that developers must confront is the choice of an object-oriented
programming language.
<P>
So-called"pure" object-oriented language (such as Smalltalk) presume a complete
run-time environment (sometimes known as a virtual machine), because their
semantics represent a major departure from traditional, procedure-oriented
system architectures.  So long as the developer works within the supplied
environment, everything works smoothly and consistently.  When the need
arises to interact with foreign environment, however (for example, to make
an external procedure call), the pure-object paradigm ends, and objects
must be reduced to data structures for external manipulation.  Unfortunately,
data structures do not retain the advantage that objects offer with regard
to encapsulation and code reuse.
<P>
"Hybrid" languages such as C++<A HREF="380_L0_.html">(**)</A> on the other
hand, require less run-time support, but sometimes result in tight bindings
between programs that implement objects (called "class libraries") and their
clients (the programs that use them). That is, implementation detail is
often unavoidably compiled into the client programs.  Tight binding between
class libraries and their clients means that client programs often must
be recompiled whenever simple changes are made in the library.  Furthermore,
no binary standard exists for C++ objects, so the C++ class libraries produced
by one C++ compiler cannot (in general) be used from C++ programs built
with a different C++ compiler.
<P>
The second obstacle developers of object-oriented software must confront
is that, because different object-oriented languages and toolkits embrace
incompatible models of what objects are and how they work, software developed
using a particular language or toolkit is naturally limited in scope.  Classes
implemented in one language cannot be readily used from another.  A C++
programmer, for example, cannot easily use classes developed in Smalltalk,
nor can a Smalltalk programmer make effective use of C++ classes. Object-oriented
language and toolkit boundaries become, in effect, barriers to interoperability.

<P>
Ironically, no such barrier exists for ordinary procedure libraries. Software
developers routinely<!-- entering slot 5 --> construct procedure libraries
that can be shared across a variety of languages, by adhering to standard
linkage conventions.  Object-oriented class libraries are inherently different
in that no binary standards or conventions exist to derive a new class from
an existing one,  or even to invoke a method in a standard way.  Procedure
libraries also have the benefit that their implementations can be freely
changed without requiring client programs to be recompiled, unlike the situation
for C++ class libraries.
<P>
For developers who need to provide binary class libraries, these are serious
obstacles. In an era of open systems and heterogeneous networking, a single-language
solution is frequently not broad enough.  Certainly, mandating a specific
compiler from a specific vendor in order to use a class library might be
grounds not to include the class library with an operating system or other
general-purpose product.
<P>
The<B> System Object Model (SOM)</B> is IBM's solution to these problems.
