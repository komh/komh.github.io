<H1>Extensions and limitations</H1><!-- entering slot 336 -->
<P>
The DSOM implementation has the following extensions and limitations in
its implementation of the CORBA specification:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->As just described, the current release of DSOM supports
a simple server activation policy, which is equivalent to the "shared" and
"persistent" policies defined by CORBA. DSOM does not explicitly support
the "unshared" or "server-per-method" server activation policies. Policies
other than the basic activation scheme must be implemented by the application.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DSOM provides null implementations for the<B> object_is_ready
</B>or<B> deactivate_obj</B> methods, defined by the BOA interface for the
unshared server activation policy.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DSOM does not support the<B> change_implementation
</B>method, defined by the<B> BOA</B>interface to allow an application to
change the implementation definition associated with an object. In DSOM,
the<B> ImplementationDef</B> identifies the server which implements an object.
 In these terms, changing an object's<B> ImplementationDef</B> would result
in a change in the object's server ID. Any existing object references that
have the old server ID would be rendered invalid.
<P>
It is possible, however, to change the program which implements an object's
server, or change the class library which implements an object's class.
To modify the program associated with an<B> ImplementationDef,</B> use the
<B>update_impldef</B> method defined on<B> ImplRepository.</B> To change
the implementation of an object's class, replace the corresponding class
library with a new (upward-compatible) one.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The OUT_list_MEMORY, IN_COPY_VALUE, and DEPENDENT_LIST
flags, used with the Dynamic Invocation Interface, are not yet supported.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The SOM Object Adapter<B> (SOMOA)</B> provides a method
<B>(change_id)</B> to update the<B> ReferenceData</B>  associated with an
object reference created by the<B> create</B> call This is useful if the
information which describes the object must be changed without invalidating
copies of the existing object reference. CORBA defines no such method; <B> change_id
</B>is an extension to the standard<B> BOA</B> methods.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> SOMOA</B> provides some specialized object
reference types which, in certain situations, are more efficient or easier-to-use
than standard object references.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->DSOM supports the SOM extension to IDL that allows
method parameters that are pointers. Structure, sequence, and array parameters
may only contain pointers to objects (not arbitrary types).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> Context::get_values</B> method currently does
not support the CTX_RESTRICT_SCOPE flag.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
