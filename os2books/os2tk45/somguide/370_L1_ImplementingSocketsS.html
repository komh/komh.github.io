<H1>Implementing Sockets Subclasses</H1><!-- entering slot 421 -->
<P>
Distributed SOM (DSOM) and the Replication Framework require basic message
services for inter-process communications. The Event Management Framework
must be integrated with the same communication services in order to handle
communications events.
<P>
To maximize their portability to a wide variety of local area network transport
protocols, the DSOM, Replication, and Event Management Frameworks have been
written to use a<I> common communications interface</I>, which is implemented
by one or more SOM class libraries using available local protocols.
<P>
The common communications interface is based on the "sockets" interface
used with TCP/IP, since its interface and semantics are fairly widespread
and well understood. The IDL interface is named<B> Sockets</B>. There is
no implementation associated with the<B> Sockets</B> interface by default;
specific protocol implementations are supplied by subclass implementations.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<B> Sockets</B> classes supplied with the SOMobjects Developer
Toolkit and run-time packages are<I> only</I> intended to support the DSOM,
Replication, and Event Management Frameworks. These class implementations
are<U> not</U> intended for general application usage.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
Available<B> Sockets</B> subclasses by SOMobjects product are as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For AIX:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>
<BR>
<B>TCPIPSockets</B> class for TCP/IP,<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<B>IPXSockets</B> class for Netware IPX/SPX, and<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<B>NBSockets</B> class for NetBIOS.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>For OS/2 and Windows:<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL><B> TCPIPSockets
</B>class (a) for TCP/IP for Windows or (b) for TCP/IP 1.2.1 on OS/2,<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<B>TCPIPSockets32</B> class for TCP/IP 2.0 on OS/2 only (see Note below),
<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<B>IPXSockets</B> class for NetWare IPX/SPX, and<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<BR>
<B>NBSockets</B> class for NetBIOS.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The<B> TCPIPSocket32</B> class gives greater performance over
the<B> TCPIPSockets</B> class on OS/2, but requires the 32-bit version of
TCPP/IP (version 2.0) rather than the 16-bit version of TCP/IP (version
1.2.1).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
Application developers may need to develop their own<B> Sockets</B>  subclass
if the desired transport protocol or product version is not one of those
supported by the SOMobjects run-time packages. This appendix explains how
to approach the implementation of a<B> Sockets</B> subclass, if necessary.

<P>
Warning: this may be a non-trivial exercise!
