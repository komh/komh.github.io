<P>
Interactive applications need special attention when coupled with EMan.
Once control is turned over to EMan by calling<B> someProcessEvents</B>,
a single-threaded application (for example, on AIX) has no way of responding
to keyboard input. The user must register interest in "stdin" with EMan
and provide a callback function that handles keyboard input. In a multi-threaded
environment (for example, OS/2), this problem can be solved by spawning
a thread to execute<B> someProcessEvents</B> and another to handle keyboard
input. (These two options are illustrated in the sample program shipped
with the Event Management Framework.)
