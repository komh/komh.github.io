<H1>Using SOM Classes in Client Programs</H1><!-- entering slot 34 -->
<P>
This chapter discusses how to use SOM classes that have already been fully
implemented. That is, these topics describe the steps that a programmer
uses to instantiate an object and invoke some method(s) on it from within
an application program.
<P>
Who should read this chapter?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Programmers who wish to use SOM classes that were
originally developed by someone else will need to know the information in
this chapter. These programmers often may not need the information from
any subsequent chapters.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->By contrast, class implementers who are creating their
own SOM classes should continue with Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler,"
and Chapter 5, "Implementing Classes in SOM "for complete information on
the SOM Interface Definition Language (SOM IDL) syntax and other details
of class implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Programs that use a class are referred to as<I> client programs</I>. A client
program can be written in  C, in C++, or in another language. As noted,
this chapter describes how client programs can use SOM classes (classes
defined using SOM, as described in Chapter 2, "Tutorial for Implementing
SOM Classes" and in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler"and Chapter
5 "Implementing Classes in SOM"). Using a SOM class involves creating instances
of a class, invoking methods on objects, and so forth. All of the methods,
functions, and macros described here can also be used by class implementers
within the implementation file for a class.
<P>
Note: "Using a SOM class," as described in this chapter, does<I> not</I> include
subclassing the class in a client program. In particular, the C++ compatible
SOM classes made available in the .xh binding file can<I> not</I> be subclassed
in C++ to create new C++ or SOM classes.
<P>
Some of the macros and functions described here are supplied as part of
SOM's C and C++<I> usage bindings</I>. These bindings are functions and
macros defined in header files to be included in client programs. The usage
bindings make it more convenient for C and C++ programmers to create and
use instances of SOM classes. SOM classes can be also used without the C
or C++ bindings, however. For example, users of other programming languages
can use SOM classes, and C and C++ programmers can use a SOM class without
using its language bindings. The language bindings simply offer a more convenient
programmer's interface to SOM. Vendors of other languages may also offer
SOM bindings; check with your language vendor for possible SOM support.

<P>
To use the C or C++ bindings for a class, a client program must include
a header file for the class (using the<B> #include</B> preprocessor directive).
For a C language client program, the file &lt;<I>classFileStem</I>&gt;.h
must be included. For a C++ language client program, the file &lt;<I>classFileStem</I>&gt;.xh
must be included. The SOM Compiler generates these header files from an
IDL interface definition. The header files contain definitions of the macros
and functions that make up the C or C++ bindings for the class. Whether
the header files include bindings for the class's private methods and attributes
(in addition to the public methods and attributes) depends on the IDL interface
definition available to the user, and on how the SOM Compiler was invoked
when generating bindings.
<P>
Usage binding headers automatically include any other bindings upon which
they may rely. Client programs not using the C or C++ bindings for any particular
class of SOM object (for example, a client program that does not know at
compile time what classes it will be using) should simply include the SOM-supplied
bindings for<B>  SOMObject</B>, provided in the header file "somobj.h" (for
C programs) or"somobj.xh" (for C++ programs).
<P>
For each task that a user of a SOM class might want to perform, this chapter
shows how the task would be accomplished by:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a C programmer using the C bindings,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>a
C++ programmer using the C++ bindings, or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>a programmer not using SOM's C or C++ language
bindings.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If neither of the first two approaches is applicable, the third approach
can always be used.
