<H1>Creation of remote objects</H1><!-- entering slot 330 -->
<P>
The OMG has standardized an "object lifecycle service," built on top of
the ORB, for creating and destroying remote objects.  Currently, DSOM provides
its own interface for creating and destroying objects (see "Basic Client
Programming"), but a future release may provide an OMG-compliant lifecycle
service as well.
