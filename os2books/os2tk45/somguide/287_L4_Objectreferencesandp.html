<H1>Object references and proxy objects</H1><!-- entering slot 329 -->
<P>
CORBA 1.1 defines the notion of an<I> object reference</I>, which is the
information needed to specify an object in the ORB. An object is defined
by its<B> ImplementationDef, InterfaceDef,</B> and application-specific
"reference data" used to identify or describe the object. An object reference
is used as a handle to a remote object in method calls. When a server wants
to export a reference to an object it implements, it supplies the object's
<B>ImplementationDef, InterfaceDef,</B> and reference data to the Object
Adapter, which returns the reference.
<P>
The structure of an object reference is opaque to the application, leaving
its representation up to the ORB.
<P>
In DSOM, an object reference is represented as an object that can simply
be used to identify the object on that server. The DSOM class that implements
simple object references is called<B> SOMDObject</B> (corresponding to<B> Object
</B>in CORBA 1.1.) However, in a client's address space, DSOM represents
the remote object with a<I> proxy object</I> in order to allow the client
to invoke methods on the target object as if it were local. When an object
reference is passed from a server to a client, DSOM<I> dynamically</I> and
<I>automatically</I> creates a proxy in the client for the remote object.
Proxies are specialized forms of<B> SOMDObject;</B> accordingly, the base
proxy class in DSOM<B> SOMDClientProxy,</B> is derived from<B> SOMDObject.
</B>
<P>
In order to create a proxy object, DSOM must first build a proxy class.
It does so automatically using SOM facilities for building classes at run
time. The proxy class is constructed using multiple inheritance: the proxy
object functionality is inherited from<B> SOMDClientProxy,</B> while just
the<I> interface</I> of the target class is inherited.
<P>
In the newly derived proxy class, DSOM overrides each method inherited from
the target class with a "remote dispatch" method that forwards an invocation
request to the remote object. Consequently, the proxy object provides location
transparency, and the client code invokes operations (methods) on the remote
object using the same language bindings as if it were a local target object.

<P>
For example, recall the "Stack" class used in the tutorial example given
earlier. When a server returns a reference to a remote "Stack" object to
the client, DSOM builds a "Stack_ _Proxy" class (note two underscores in
the name), derived from<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> and "Stack", and creates
a proxy object from that class.  When the client invokes the "push" method
on the proxy,
<PRE>
_push(stk, &amp;ev, 100);

</PRE>

<P>
the method is redispatched using the remote-dispatch method of the SOMDClientProxy
class, and the method is forwarded to the target object.
<P>
CORBA defines several special operations on object references that operate
on the local references (proxies) themselves, rather than on the remote
objects. These operations are defined by the classes<B> SOMOA</B> (SOM Object
Adapter),<B> SOMDObject</B> (which is DSOM's implementation of CORBA's<B> Object
</B>"pseudo-class" and<B> ORB</B> (Object Request Broker class). Some of
these operations are listed below, expressed in terms of their IDL definitions.
