<H1>SOM-derived metaclasses</H1><!-- entering slot 153 -->
<P>
As previously discussed, a class object can perform any of the class methods
that its metaclass defines. New metaclasses are typically created to modify
existing class methods or introduce new class method(s). Chapter 8, "Metaclass
Framework," discusses metaclass programming.
<P>
Three factors are essential for effective use of metaclasses in SOM:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, every class in SOM is an object that is implemented
by a metaclass.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, programmers can define and name new metaclasses,
and can use these metaclasses when defining new SOM classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finally, and most importantly, metaclasses cannot
interfere with the fundamental guarantee required of every OOP system: specifically,
any code that executes without method-resolution error on instances of a
given class will also execute without method-resolution errors on instances
of any subclass of this class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Surprisingly, SOM is currently the only OOP system that can make this final
guarantee while also allowing programmers to explicitly define and use named
metaclasses. This is possible because SOM automatically determines an appropriate
metaclass that supports this guarantee, automatically deriving new metaclasses
by subclassing at run time when this is necessary. As an example, suppose
class "A" is an instance of metaclass "AMeta".
<P>
Assume that "AMeta" supports a method "bar" and that "A" supports a method
"foo" that uses the expression "_bar( _somGetClass(somSelf ) )." That is,
method "foo" invokes "bar" on the class of the object on which "foo" is
invoked. For example, when method "foo" is invoked on an instance of class
"A" (say, object "O{1}"), this in turn invokes "bar" on class "A" itself.

<P>
Now consider what happens if class "A" were subclassed by "B," a class that
has the explicit metaclass "BMeta" declared in its SOM IDL source file (and
assuming "BMeta" is not derived from "AMeta"). Also assume that object "O{2}"
is an instance of class "B."
<P>
Recall that "AMeta" supports method "bar" and that class "A" supports method
"foo" (which incorporates "bar" in its definition). Given the hierarchy
described above, an invocation of "foo" on "O {2}" would fail, because metaclass
"BMeta" does not support the "bar" method. ExampleofMetaclassIncompatibility

<P>

<P>
There is only one way that "BMeta" can support this specific method-by inheriting
it from "AMeta" ("BMeta" could introduce another method named "bar", but
this would be a<I> different</I> method from the one introduced by "AMeta").
Therefore, in this example, because "BMeta" is not a subclass of "AMeta",
"BMeta" cannot be allowed to be the metaclass of "B". That is, "BMeta" is
not compatible with the requirements placed on "B" by the fundamental principle
of OOP referred to above. This situation is referred to as<I> metaclass
incompatibility</I>.
<P>
SOM does not allow hierarchies with metaclass incompatibilities. Instead,
SOM automatically builds<I> derived metaclasses</I> when this is necessary.
For example, SOM would create a "DerivedMeta" metaclass that has both "AMeta"
and "BMeta" as parents. This ensures that the invocation of method "foo"
on instances of class "B" will not fail, and also ensures that the desired
class methods provided by "BMeta" will be available on class "B".

Example of a Derived Metaclass

<P>
There are three important aspects of SOM's approach to derived metaclasses:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First, the creation of SOM-derived metaclasses is
integrated with programmer-specified metaclasses. If a programmer-specified
metaclass already supports all the class methods and variables needed by
a new class, then the programmer-specified metaclass will be used as is.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second, if SOM must derive a different metaclass than
the one explicitly indicated by the programmer (in order to support all
the necessary class methods and variables), then the SOM-derived metaclass
inherits from the explicitly indicated metaclass first. As a result, the
method procedures defined by the specified metaclass take precedence over
other possibilities (see the following section on<!-- entering slot 154 --> inheritance
and the discussion of resolution of ambiguity in the case of multiple inheritance).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Finally, the class methods defined by the derived
metaclass invoke the appropriate initialization methods of its parents to
ensure that the class variables of its instances are correctly initialized.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
As further explanation for the automatic derivation of metaclasses, consider
the following multiple-inheritance example. Class "C" (derived from classes
"A" and "B") does not have an explicit metaclass declaration in its SOM
IDL, yet its parents "A" and "B" do. As a result, class "C" requires a derived
metaclass. (If you still have trouble following the reasoning behind derived
metaclasses, ask yourself the following question: What class should "C"
be an instance of? After a bit of reflection, you will conclude that, if
SOM did not build the derived metaclass, you would have to do so yourself.)

<P>
In summary, SOM allows and encourages the definition and explicit use of
named metaclasses. With named metaclasses, programmers can not only affect
the behavior of class instances by choosing the parents of classes, but
they can also affect the behavior of the classes themselves by choosing
their metaclasses.  Because the behavior of classes in SOM includes the
implementation of inheritance itself, metaclasses in SOM provide an extremely
flexible and powerful capability allowing classes to package solutions to
problems that are otherwise very difficult to address within an OOP context.

<P>
At the same time, SOM is unique in that it relieves programmers of the responsibility
for avoiding metaclass incompatibility when defining a new class. At first
glance, this might seem to be merely a useful (though very important) convenience.
But, in fact, it is absolutely essential, because SOM is predicated on binary
compatibility with respect to changes in class implementations.
<P>
A programmer might, at one point in time, know the metaclasses of all ancestor
classes of a new subclass, and, as a result, be able to explicitly derive
an appropriate metaclass for the new class. Nevertheless, SOM must guarantee
that this new class will still execute and perform correctly when any of
its ancestor class's implementations are changed (which could even include
specifying different metaclasses). Derived metaclasses allow SOM to make
this guarantee.  A SOM programmer need never worry about the problem of
metaclass incompatibility; SOM does this for the programmer. Instead, explicit
metaclasses can simply be used to "add in" whatever behavior is desired
for a new class. SOM automatically handles anything else that is needed.
Chapter 10 provides useful examples of such metaclasses. A SOM programmer
should find numerous applications for the techniques that are illustrated
there.
