<P>
The CORBA specification defines a Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) that
can be used to dynamically build requests on remote objects. This interface
is described in section 6 (page 105) of the CORBA 1.1 document, and is implemented
in DSOM. The DSOM implementation of the DII is described later in this chapter,
in the topic entitled "Dynamic Invocation Interface" under Section 6.9 "Advanced
topics." Note that, in DSOM,<B> somDispatch</B> is overridden so that method
invocations on proxy objects are forwarded to the remote target object.
SOM applications can use the SOM<B> somDispatch</B> method for dynamic method
calls whether the object is local or remote.
