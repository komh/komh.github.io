<H1>Initiating a Request</H1><!-- entering slot 348 -->
<P>
There are two ways to initiate a request, using either the<B> invoke</B> or
<B>send</B> method defined by the<B> Request</B> class. The IDL prototypes
for these two operations ar as follows:
<PRE>
ORBStatus <B>invoke</B>(
                in Flags        invoke_flags );

ORBStatus <B>send</B>(
                in Flags        send_flags );
</PRE>

<P>
The<B> invoke</B> method calls the ORB, which handles the remote method
invocation and returns the result. This method will block while awaiting
return of the result.
<P>
The<B> send</B> method calls the ORB but does not wait for the operation
to complete before returning. To determine when the operation is complete,
the client must call the<B> get_response</B> method (also defined by the
<B>Request</B> class), which has this IDL prototype:
<PRE>
ORBStatus <B>get_response</B>(
                in Flags        response_flags );
</PRE>

<P>
The following flag is defined for<B> get_response:</B>
<BR>
RESP_NO_WAIT       Means that the caller does not want to wait for a   
             response.
<BR>

<P>
<B>get_response</B> determines whether a request has competed. If the RESP_NO_WAIT
flag is set,<B> get_response</B> returns immediately even if the request
is still in progress. If RESP_NO_WAIT is not set,<B> get_response</B> waits
until the request is done before returning.
