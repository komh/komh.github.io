<H1>Interface declarations</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
The IDL specification for a class of objects must contain a declaration
of the<B> interface</B> these objects will support. Because, in SOM, objects
are implemented using classes, the interface name is always used as a class
name as well. Therefore, an interface declaration can be understood to specify
a class name, and its parent (direct base) class names. This is the approach
used in the following description of an interface declaration. In addition
to the class name and its parents names, an interface indicates new methods
(operations), and any constants, type definitions, and exception structures
that the interface exports. An interface declaration has the following syntax:
<B>interface class-name</B> [: parent-class1, parent-class2, ...]
<BR>
{
<BR>
<I>constant declarations</I>       (optional)
<BR>
<I>type declarations</I>         (optional)
<BR>
<I>exception declarations</I>      (optional)
<BR>
<I>attribute declarations</I>      (optional)
<BR>
<I>method declarations</I>        (optional)
<BR>
<I>implementation statement</I>     (optional)
<BR>
};
<BR>

<P>
Many class implementers distinguish a "class-name" by using an initial capital
letter, but that is optional. The "parent-class" (or base-class) names specify
the interfaces from which the interface of "class-name" instances is derived.
Parent-class names are required only for the immediate parent(s). Each parent
class must have its own IDL specification (which must be<I> #include</I>d
in the subclass's .idl file). A parent class cannot be named more than once
in the<B> interface</B> statement header.
<P>
Note: In general, an "<B>interface</B> class-name" header must precede any
subsequent implementation that references "class-name." For more discussion
of multiple<B> interface</B> statements, refer to the later topic "Module
declarations to define multiple interfaces in an .idl file."
<P>
The following topics describe the various declarations/statements that can
be specified within the body of an<B> interface</B> declaration. The order
in which these declarations are specified is usually optional, and declarations
of different kinds can be intermixed. Although all of the declarations/statements
are listed above as "optional," in some cases using one of them may mandate
another. For example, if a<B> method</B> raises an<B> exception</B>, the
exception structure must be defined beforehand. In general,<B> types, constants,
</B>and<B> exceptions,</B> as well as<B> interface</B> declarations, must
be defined before they are referenced, as in C/C++.
