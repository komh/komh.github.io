<H1>Obtaining a method's procedure pointer</H1><!-- entering slot 55 -->
<P>
<I>Method resolution</I> is the process of obtaining a pointer to the procedure
that implements a particular method for a particular object at run time.
 The method is then invoked subsequently by calling that procedure, passing
the method's intended receiver, the<B> Environment</B> pointer (if needed),
the<B> context</B> argument (if needed), and the method's other arguments,
if any. C and C++ programmers may wish to obtain a pointer to a method's
procedure for efficient repeated invocations.
<P>
Obtaining a pointer to a method's procedure is achieved in one of two ways,
depending on whether the method is to be resolved using<B> offset</B> resolution
or<B> name-lookup</B> resolution. Obtaining a method's procedure pointer
via offset resolution is faster, but it requires that the name of the class
that introduces the method and the name of the method be known at compile
time.  It also requires that the method be defined as part of that class's
interface in the IDL specification of the class. (See the topic "Method
Resolution" in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler" for more information
on offset and name-lookup method resolution.)
