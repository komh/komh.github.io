<H1>Destroying objects via a server object</H1><!-- entering slot 254 -->
<P>
The<B> somdDestroyObject</B> method described above sends a request to delete
a remote object to the object's server. It does so to ensure that the server
has an opportunity to participate in, if not perform, the deletion. The
method defined on the<B> SOMDServer</B> class for destroying objects is
<B>somdDeleteObj</B>. If the client has a proxy for the server object, it
can also invoke<B> somdDeleteObj</B> directly, instead of calling<B> somdDestroyObject</B>.

<P>
Destroying objects via the server object, rather than asking the object
itself (as in<B> somFree</B> or<B> somdTargetFree</B>), allows the server
object do any clean-up that is needed. For simple applications, this may
not be necessary, but for applications that provide their own application-tailored
server objects, it may be critical. See, for example, the persistent server
example in section 6.4, entitled "Basic Server Programming."
