<H1>Implementations and servers</H1><!-- entering slot 334 -->
<P>
The CORBA specification defines the term<I> implementation</I> as the code
that implements an object. The implementation usually consists of a program
and class libraries.
<P>
<I>Servers</I> are processes that execute object implementations. CORBA
1.1 defines four activation policies for server implementations: shared,
unshared, server-per-method, and persistent, as follows.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A<I> shared</I> server implements multiple objects
(of arbitrary classes the same time, and allows multiple methods to be invoked
at the same time.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An<I> unshared</I>  server, conversely, implements
only a single object and  handles one request at a time.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> server-per-method</I>  policy requires a separate
process to be created for each request on an object and, usually, a separate
program implements each method.
<P>
Under the shared, unshared, and server-per-method activation policies, servers
are activated automatically (on demand).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A<I> persistent</I>  server, by contrast, is a shared
server that is activated "by hand" (for example, from the command shell
or from a startup script), vs. being activated automatically when the first
method is dispatched to it.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The term "persistent server" refers to the relative lifetime of the server:
it is "always running" when DSOM is running. (CORBA implies that persistent
servers are usually started at ORB boot time.) It should not be assumed,
however, that a "persistent" server necessarily implements persistent objects
(that persist between ORB reboots).
<P>
In DSOM, specific process models are implemented by the server program.
That is, DSOM simply starts a specified program when a client attempts to
connect to a server. The four CORBA activation policies, or any other policies,
can be implemented by the application as necessary. For example,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->an object that requires a server-per-method implementation
could itself spawn a process at the beginning of each method execution.
Alternatively, the server object in the "main" server can spawn a process
before each method dispatch.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->a dedicated server could be registered for each object
that requires an unshared server implementation (separate process). This
may be done dynamically (see the topic "Programmatic interface to the Implementation
Repository" earlier in this chapter).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An<B> ImplementationDef</B> object, as defined by the CORBA specification,
describes the characteristics of a particular implementation. In DSOM, an
<B>ImplementationDef</B> identifies an implementation's unique ID, the program
name, its location, and so forth. The<B> ImplementationDef</B> objects are
stored in an<I> Implementation Repository,</I> which is represented in DSOM
by an<B> ImplRepository</B> object.
<P>
A CORBA-compliant ORB must provide the mechanisms for a server program to
register itself with the ORB. To "register itself with the ORB" simply means
to tell the ORB enough information about the server process so that the
ORB will be able to locate, activate, deactivate, and dispatch methods to
the server process. DSOM supports these mechanisms, so that server programs
written in arbitrary languages can be used with DSOM. (See also the next
topic, "Object Adapters.")
<P>
In addition to the generic registration mechanisms provided by all CORBA-compliant
ORBs, DSOM provides extra support for using SOM-class DLLs. DSOM provides
a generic server  program that automatically registers itself with DSOM,
loads SOM-class DLLs on demand, and dispatches incoming requests on SOM
objects. Thus, by using the generic server program (when appropriate), a
user may be able to avoid writing any server program code.
