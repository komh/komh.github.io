or<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
even if the programming language does not directly support object-oriented
programming.
<P>
The discussions in this book are expressed in the commonly used terminology
of object-oriented programming. A number of important terms are everyday
English words that take on specialized meanings. These terms appear in the
Glossary at the back of this book. You may find it worth consulting the
Glossary if the unusual significance attached to an otherwise ordinary word
puzzles you.
<P>
This book assumes that you are an experienced programmer and that you have
a general familiarity with the basic notions of object-oriented programming.
Practical experience using an object-oriented programming language is helpful,
but not essential.
<P>
If you would like a good introduction to object-oriented programming or
a general survey of the many aspects of the topic, you might enjoy reading
