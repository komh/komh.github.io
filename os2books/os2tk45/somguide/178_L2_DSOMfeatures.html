<H1>DSOM features</H1><!-- entering slot 214 -->
<P>
Here is a quick summary of some of DSOM's more important features:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Uses the standard SOM Compiler, Interface Repository,
language bindings, and class libraries.  Thus, DSOM provides a growth path
for non-distributed SOM applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Allows an application program to access a mix of local
and remote objects. The fact that an object is remote is transparent to
the program.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides run-time services for creating, destroying,
identifying, locating, and dispatching methods on remote objects. These
services can be overridden or augmented to suit the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Uses existing interprocess communication (IPC) facilities
for Workstation communication, and common local area network (LAN) transport
facilities for Workgroup communications. Support for TCP/IP, Netware IPX/SPX,
and NetBios is provided. DSOM communications is extensible in that an application
can provide its own transport.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides support for writing multi-threaded servers
and event-driven programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Provides a default object server program, which can
be easily used to<B> create</B> SOM objects and make those objects accessible
to one or more client programs. If the default server program is used, SOM
class libraries are loaded upon demand, so no server programming or compiling
is necessary.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Complies with the CORBA 1.1 specification, which is
important for application portability.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
