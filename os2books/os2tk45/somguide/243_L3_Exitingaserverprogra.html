<H1>Exiting a server program</H1><!-- entering slot 280 -->
<P>
When a server program exits, it should notify the DSOM run time that it
is no longer accepting requests. This should be done whether the program
exits normally, or as the result of an error. If this is not done,<B> somdd
</B>will continue to think that the server program is active, allowing clients
to attempt to connect to it, as well as preventing a new copy of that server
from being activated.
<P>
To notify DSOM when the server program is exiting, the<B> deactivate_impl
</B>method defined on SOMOA should be called. For example,
<PRE> /* tell DSOM (via SOMOA) that server is now terminating */
    _deactivate_impl(SOMD_SOMOAObject, &amp;ev, SOMD_ImplDefObject);
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> For robustness, it would be worthwhile to add appropriate
"exit handlers" or "signal handlers" to your application servers that call
the<B> deactivate_impl</B> method upon abnormal program termination. This
ensures the the DSOM daemon is made aware of the server's termination, so
that client connections are no longer allowed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Finally, at the end of a server program, the<B> SOMD_Uninit</B> procedure
must be called to free DSOM run-time objects, and to release semaphores,
shared memory segments, and any other system resources.
<P>
For example, the exit code in the server program might look like this:
<PRE>    ...
    SOMD_Uninit(&amp;e);
    SOM_UninitEnvironment(&amp;e);
}

</PRE>

<P>
Observe also the<B> SOM_UninitEnvironment</B> call, which frees any memory
associated with the specified<B> Environment</B> structure.
<P>
When a Windows DSOM server application receives a WM_QUIT message while
processing incoming requests, the<B> execute_request_loop</B> method will
return SOMDERROR_WMQUIT.  When the server receives SOMDERROR_WMQUIT, it
should perform its usual clean up and termination procedures.
