<H1>The SOM  IR file "som.ir"</H1><!-- entering slot 366 -->
<P>
The SOMobjects Toolkit includes an Interface Repository file ("som.ir")
that contains objects describing all of the types, classes, and methods
provided by the various frameworks of the SOMobjects Toolkit. Since all
new classes will ultimately be derived from these predefined SOM classes,
some of this information also needs to be included in a programmer's own
interface repository files.
<P>
For example, suppose a new class, called "MyClass", is derived from<B> SOMObject</B>.
When the SOM Compiler builds an Interface Repository for "MyClass", that
IR will also include all of the information associated with the<B> SOMObject
</B>class. This happens because the<B> SOMObject</B> class definition is
inherited by each new class; thus, all of the<B> SOMObject</B> methods and
typedefs are implicitly contained in the new class as well.
<P>
Eventually, the process of deriving new classes from existing ones would
lead to a great deal of duplication of information in separate interface
repository files. This would be inefficient, wasteful of space, and extremely
difficult to manage. For example, to make an evolutionary change to some
class interface, a programmer would need to know about and subsequently
update all of the interface repository files where information about that
interface occurred.
<P>
One way to avoid this dilemma would be to keep all interface definitions
in a single interface repository (such as "som.ir"). This is not recommended,
however. A single interface repository would soon grow to be unwieldy in
size and become a source of frequent access contention. Everyone involved
in developing class definitions would need update access to this one file,
and simultaneous uses might result in longer compile times.
