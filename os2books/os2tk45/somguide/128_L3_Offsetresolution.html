<H1>Offset resolution</H1><!-- entering slot 158 -->
<P>
When using SOM's C and C++ language bindings, offset resolution is the default
way of resolving methods, because it is the fastest. For those familiar
with C++, it is roughly equivalent to the C++ "virtual function" concept.

<P>
Although offset resolution is the fastest technique for method resolution,
it is also the most constrained. Specifically, using offset resolution requires
these constraints:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the method to be invoked must be known
at compile time,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The name of the class that introduces the method must
be known at compile time (although not necessarily by the programmer), and
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The method to be invoked must be part of the introducing
class's static (IDL) interface definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
To perform offset method resolution, SOM first obtains a<I> method token
</I>from a global data structure associated with the class that introduced
the method. This data structure is called the<I> ClassData structure</I>.
It includes a method token for each method the class introduces. The method
token is then used as an "index" into the receiver's<I> method table,</I> to
access the appropriate method procedure. Because it is known at compile
time which class introduces the method and where in that class's ClassData
structure the method's token is stored, offset resolution is quite efficient.
The cost of offset method resolution is currently about twice the cost of
calling a C function using a pointer loaded with the function address.
<P>
An object's method table is a table of pointers to the procedures that implement
the methods that the object supports. This table is constructed by the object's
class and is shared among the class instances. The method table built by
class (for its instances) is referred to as the class's<I> instance method
table</I>. This is useful terminology, since, in SOM, a class is itself
an object with a method table (created by its metaclass) used to support
method calls on the class.
<P>
Usually, offset method resolution is sufficient; however, in some cases,
the more flexible name-lookup resolution is required.
