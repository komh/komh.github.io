As mentioned previously, DSOM provides a simple, "generic" server program
that performs all of these tasks. All the server programmer needs to provide
are the application class library(ies) DLL that the implementer wants to
distribute. Optionally, the programmer can also supply an application#specific
server class, derived from<B> SOMDServer</B>. (The<B> SOMDServer</B> class
can be used by default.) The server program does the rest automatically.

<P>
The "generic" server program is called<B> somdsvr</B> and can be found in
/usr/lpp/som/bin/somdsvr on AIX and in %SOMBASE%\bin\somdsvr.exe on OS/2.

<P>
Some applications may require additional flexibility or functionality than
what is provided by the generic server program. In that case, application-specific
server programs can be developed. This section discusses the steps involved
in writing such a server program.
<P>
To create a server program, a server writer needs to know what services
the DSOM run-time environment will provide and how to use those services
to perform the duties (listed above) of a server. The DSOM run-time environment
provides several key objects that can be used to perform server tasks. These
objects and the services they provide will be discussed in this section.
Examples showing how to use the run-time objects to write a server are also
shown.
