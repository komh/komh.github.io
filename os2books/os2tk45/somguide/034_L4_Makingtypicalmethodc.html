<H1>Making typical method calls</H1><!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
<U><I>For C programmers with usage bindings:</I></U> To invoke a method
in C, use the macro:
<P>
_&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver, args)</I>
<P>
(that is, an underscore followed by the method name). Arguments to the macro
are the receiver of the method followed by all of the arguments to the method.
For example:
<PRE>   _foo(obj, somGetGlobalEnvironment(), x, y)
</PRE>

<P>
This invokes method "foo" on "obj" (the remaining arguments are arguments
to the method "foo"). This expression can be used anywhere that a standard
function call can be used in C.
<P>
<B>Required arguments</B>
<P>
In C, calls to methods defined using IDL require at least two arguments-
a pointer to the<I> receiving object</I> (the object responding to the method)
and a value of type (<B>Environment *</B>). The<B> Environment</B> data
structure is specified by CORBA, and is used to pass environmental information
between a caller and a called method. For example, it is used to return
exceptions. (For more information on how to supply and use the<B> Environment
</B>structure, see the later section entitled "Exceptions and error handling.")

<P>
In the IDL definition of a method, by contrast, the receiver and the<B> Environment
</B>pointer are<I> not</I> listed as parameters to the method. (Unlike the
receiver, the<B> Environment</B> pointer is considered a method parameter,
even though it is never explicitly specified in IDL. For this reason, it
is called an<I> implicit</I> method parameter.) For example, if a method
is defined in a .idl file with two parameters, as in:
<PRE>   int foo (in char c, in float f);
</PRE>

<P>
then, with the C usage bindings, the method would be invoked with four arguments,
as in:
<PRE>   intvar = _foo(obj, somGetGlobalEnvironment(), x, y);
</PRE>

<P>
where "obj" is the object responding to the method and "x" and "y" are the
arguments corresponding to "c" and "f", above.
<P>
If the IDL specification of the method includes a<I> context</I> specification,
then the method has an additional (implicit)<B> context</B> parameter. Thus,
when invoking the method, this argument must follow immediately after the
<U><I>Environment</I></U> pointer argument.  (None of the SOM-supplied methods
require<B> context</B> arguments.)  The<B> Environment</B>  and<B> context
</B>method parameters are prescribed by the CORBA standard.
<P>
If the IDL specification of the class that introduces the method includes
the<B> callstyle=oidl</B> modifier, then the (<B>Environment*</B>) and<B> context
</B>arguments should not be supplied when invoking the method. That is,
the receiver of the method call is followed immediately by the arguments
to the method (if any). Some of the classes supplied in the SOMobjects Toolkit
(including<B> SOMObject, SOMClass</B>, and<B> SOMClassMgr</B>) are defined
in this way, to ensure compatibility with the previous release of SOM. The
<I>System Object Model Programming Reference</I> specifies for each method
whether these arguments are used.
<P>
If you use a C expression to compute the first argument to a method call
(the receiver), you must use an expression without side effects, because
the first argument is evaluated twice by the _&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt;
macro expansion. In particular, a<B> somNew</B> method call or a macro call
of &lt;<I>className</I>&gt;<B>New</B> can<I> not</I> be used as the first
argument to a C method call, because doing so would create two new class
instances rather than one.
<P>
Following the initial, required arguments to a method (the receiving object,
the<B> Environment,</B> if any, and the context, if any), you enter any
additional arguments required by that method, as specified in IDL.  For
a discussion of how IDL<B> in/out/inout</B> argument types may to C/C++
data types, see the topic "Parameter list" in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the
SOM Compiler."
<P>
<B>Short form vs long form</B>
<P>
If a client program uses the bindings for two different classes that introduce
or inherit two different methods of the same name, then the _&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt;
macro described above (called the<I> short form</I>) will not be provided
by the bindings, because the macro would be ambiguous in that circumstance.
The following<I> long form</I> macro,<!-- entering slot 45 --> however,
is always provided by the usage bindings for each class that supports the
method:
<P>
&lt;<I>className</I>&gt;_&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>receiver, args</I>)

<P>
For example, method "foo" supported by class "Bar" can be invoked as:   Bar_foo(obj,
somGetGlobalEnvironment(), x, y)   (in C)
<BR>

<P>
where "obj"  has type "Bar" and "x" and "y" are the arguments to method
"foo".
<P>
In most cases (where there is no ambiguity, and where the method is not
a<B> va_list</B> method, as described in the subsequent subtopic "Using
'va_list' methods"), a C programmer may use either the short or the long
form of a method invocation macro interchangeably. However,<U> only</U> the
long form complies with the CORBA standard for C usage bindings.  If you
wish to write code that can be easily ported to other vendor platforms that
support the CORBA standard, use the long form exclusively. The long form
is always available for every method that a class supports. The short form
is provided both as a programming convenience and for source code compatibility
with release 1 of SOM.
<P>
In order to use the long form, a programmer will usually know what type
an object is expected to have.  If this is not known, but the different
methods have the same signature, the method can be invoked using name-lookup
resolution, as described in a following subtopic of this section.
<P>
<U><I>For C++  programmers with usage bindings</I></U>:  To invoke a method,
use the standard C++ form shown below:
<P>
obj-&gt;&lt;<I>methodName</I>&gt; (<I>args</I>)
<P>
where<I> args</I> are the arguments to the method. For instance, the following
example invokes method "foo" on "obj":
<PRE>   obj-&gt;foo(somGetGlobalEnvironment(), x, y)
</PRE>
<B>Required arguments</B>
<P>
All methods introduced by classes declared using IDL (except those having
the SOM IDL<B> callstyle=oidl</B> modifier) have at least one parameter-a
value of type (<B>Environment *</B>). The<B> Environment</B> data structure
is used to pass environmental information between a caller and a called
method. For example, it is used to return exceptions. For more information
on how to supply and use the<B> Environment</B> structure, see the later
section entitled "Exceptions and error handling."
<P>
The<B> Environment</B> pointer is an implicit parameter; in the IDL definition
of a method, the<B> Environment</B> pointer is<I> not</I> explicitly listed
as a parameter to the method. For example, if a method is defined in IDL
with two explicit parameters, as in:
<PRE>   int foo (in char c, in float f);
</PRE>

<P>
then the method would be invoked from C++ bindings with three arguments,
as in:
<PRE>   intvar = obj-&gt;foo(somGetGlobalEnvironment(), x, y);
</PRE>

<P>
where "obj" is the object responding to the method and "x" and "y" are the
arguments corresponding to "c" and "f", above.
<P>
If the IDL specification of the method includes a<I> context</I> specification,
then the method has a second implicit parameter, of type<B> context</B>,
and the method must be invoked with an additional<B> context</B> argument.
 This argument must follow immediately after the<U><I> Environment</I></U> pointer
argument.  (No SOM-supplied methods require<B> context</B> arguments.)  The
<B>Environment</B> and<B> context</B> method parameters are prescribed by
the CORBA standard.
<P>
If the IDL specification of the class that introduces the method includes
the<B> callstyle=oidl</B> modifier, then the (<B>Environment</B><B>  *</B>)
and<B> context</B> arguments should not be supplied when the method is invoked.
Some of the classes supplied in the SOMobjects Toolkit (including<B> SOMObject,
SOMClass</B>, and<B> SOMClassMgr</B>) are defined in this way, to ensure
compatibility with the previous release of SOM. The<I> System Object Model
Programming Reference</I> specifies for each method whether these arguments
are used.
<P>
Following the initial, required arguments to a method (the receiving object,
the<B> Environment,</B> if any, and the<B> context,</B> if any), you<!-- entering slot 46 --> enter
any additional arguments required by that method, as specified in IDL.  For
a discussion of how IDL<B> in/out/inout</B> argument types map to C/C++
data types, see the topic "Parameter list" in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the
SOM Compiler."
<P>
<U><I>For non-C/C++ programmers</I></U>:  To invoke a<I> static method</I>
(that is, a method declared when defining an OIDL or IDL object interface)
without using the C or C++ usage bindings, a programmer can use the<B> somResolve
</B>procedure. The<B> somResolve</B>  procedure takes as arguments a pointer
to the object on which the method is to be invoked and a<I> method token
</I>for the desired method. It returns a pointer to the method's procedure
(or raises a fatal error if the object does not support the method). Depending
on the language and system, it may be necessary to cast this procedure pointer
to the appropriate type; the way this is done is language-specific.
<P>
The method is then invoked by calling the procedure returned by<B> somResolve
</B>(the means for calling a procedure, given a pointer to it, is language-specific),
passing the method's receiver, the<B> Environment</B> pointer (if necessary),
the<B> context</B> argument (if necessary) and the remainder of the method's
arguments, if any. (See the section above for C programmers; the arguments
to a method procedure are the same as the arguments passed using the long
form of the C-language method-invocation macro for that method.)
<P>
Using<B> somResolve</B> requires the programmer to know where to find the
<I>method token</I> for the desired method. Method tokens are available
from class objects that support the method (via the method<B> somGetMethodToken</B>),
or from a global data structure, called the<I> ClassData structure,</I>
corresponding to the class that introduces the method. In C and C++ programs
with access to the definitions for ClassData structures provided by usage
bindings, the method token for method<I> methodName</I> introduced by class
<I>className</I> may be accessed by the following expression:
<P>
&lt;<I>className&gt;</I><B>ClassData.</B><I>&lt;methodName</I> &gt;
<P>
For example, the method token for method "sayHello"introduced by class "Hello"
is stored at location HelloClassData.sayHello, for C and C++ programmers.
 The way method tokens are accessed in other languages is language-specific.

<P>
As an  example of using offset resolution to invoke methods from a programming
language other than C/C++, one would do the following to create an instance
of a SOM Class<I> X</I> in Smalltalk:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initialize the SOM run-time environment, if it
has not previously been initialized, using the<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> function.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If the class object for class<I> X</I> has not
yet been created, use<B> somResolve</B> with arguments<B> SOMClassMgrObject
</B>(returned by<B> somEnvironmentNew</B> in step 1) and the method token
for the<B> somFindClass</B> method<I>,</I>  to obtain a method procedure
pointer for the<B> somFindClass</B> method. Use the method procedure for
<B>somFindClass</B> to create the class object for class<I> X</I>:  Call
the procedure with arguments<B> SOMClassMgrObject</B>, the result of calling
the<B> somIdFromString</B> function with argument<I> "X",</I> and the major
and minor version numbers for class<I> X</I> (or zero). The procedure returns
the class object for class<I> X</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use<B> somResolve</B> with arguments representing
the class object for<I> X</I> (returned by<B> somFindClass</B> in step 2)
and the method token for the<B> somNew</B> method, to obtain a method procedure
pointer for method<B> somNew</B>. (The<B> somNew</B> method is used to create
instances of class<I> X</I>.)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Call the method procedure for<B> somNew</B> (using
the method procedure pointer obtained in step 3) with the class object for
<I>X</I> (returned by<B> somFindClass</B> in step 3) as the argument. The
procedure returns a new instance of class<I> X</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In addition to<B> somResolve</B>, SOM also supplies the<B> somClassResolve
</B>procedure. Instead of an object, the<B> somClassResolve</B> procedure
takes a class as its first argument, and then selects a method procedure
from the instance method table of the passed class. (The<B> somResolve</B> procedure,
by contrast, selects a method procedure from the instance method table of
the class of which the passed object is an instance.) The<B> somClassResolve
</B>procedure therefore supports<I> casted</I>  method resolution. See the
<I>System Object Model Programming Reference</I> for more information on
<B>somResolve</B>  and<B> somClassResolve</B>.
<P>
If the programmer does not know at compile time which class introduces the
method to be invoked, or if the programmer cannot directly access method
tokens, then the procedure<B> somResolveByName</B> can be used to obtain
a method procedure using name-lookup resolution, as described in the next
section.
<P>
If the signature of the method to be invoked is not known at compile time,
but can be<!-- entering slot 47 --> discovered at run time, use<B> somResolve
</B>or<B> somResolveByName</B>  to get a pointer to the<B> somDispatch</B> method
procedure, then use it to invoke the specific method, as described below
under "Method name or signature not known at compile time."
