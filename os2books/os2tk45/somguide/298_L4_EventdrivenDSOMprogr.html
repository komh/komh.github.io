<H1>Event-driven DSOM programs using EMan</H1><!-- entering slot 340 -->
<P>
EMan (see Chapter 9 on "The Event Management Framework") is not a replacement
for threads, but it supports processing of asynchronous requests. EMan allows
a program to handle events from multiple input sources; but the handlers
run on a single thread, under control of EMan's main loop.
<P>
DSOM provides a runtime function,<B> SOMD_RegisterCallback</B>, which is
used by DSOM to associate user-supplied event handlers with DSOM's communications
sockets and message queues with EMan. Example code is shown below.
<P>
DSOM server programs which use EMan must be very careful not to get into
deadlock situations. This is quite easy to do with DSOM, since method calls
are synchronous. If two cooperating processes simultaneously make calls
on each other, a deadlock could result. Likewise, if a method call on remote
object B from A requires a method call back to A, a deadlock cycle will
exist. (Of course, the number of processes and objects which create the
cyclic dependency could be greater than two.)
<P>
The application developer must be careful to avoid situations where cooperating
processes are likely to make calls upon each other, creating a cyclic dependency.
Some applications may find it appropriate to use oneway messages to avoid
deadlock cycles, since oneway messages do not cause a process to block.
It may also be possible for an application to defer the actual processing
of a method that may "call back" an originating process, by scheduling work
using EMan client events.
