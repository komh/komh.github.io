<H1>Memory management</H1><!-- entering slot 262 -->
<P>
DSOM programs must manage four different kinds of memory resources: objects,
object references, Environment structures, and blocks of memory. There are
different techniques for allocating and releasing each kind of resource.

<P>
<B>Objects and object references</B>
<P>
Creating and destroying remote objects was discussed previously in this
section (see "Creating remote objects" and "Destroying remote objects").
Creating and destroying local objects is described in section 3.2, "Using
SOM Classes - the Basics," in Chapter 3, "Using SOM Classes in Client Programs."
 Object references are typically created automatically by DSOM as needed
by the client program. They are also released in the client program by using
either the<B> release</B> method or the<B> somdProxyFree</B> method. (The
two methods are equivalent.)
<P>
<B>Environment structures</B>
<P>
When a client invokes a method and the method returns an exception in the
Environment structure, it is the client's responsibility to free the exception.
This is done by calling either<B> exception_free</B> or<B> somdExceptionFree
</B>on the Envirnmen structure in which the exception was returned. (The
two functions are equivalent.) A similar function,<B> somExceptionFree,
</B>is available for SOM programmers however DSOM programmers can use<B> somdExceptionFree
</B>to free all exceptions (regardless of whether they were returned from
a local or remote method call).
<P>
<B>Blocks of memory</B>
<P>
For allocating and releasing blocks of memory within a client program, SOM
provides the<B> SOMMalloc</B> and<B> SOMFree</B> functions (analogous to
the C "mallo" and "free" functions). The "Memory Management" section of
Chapter 3 describes these functions. To release memory allocated by DSOM
in response to a remote method call, however, DSOM client programs should
use the<B> ORBfree</B> function
<P>
For example, when a method is invoked that returns a result of type string,
sequence, or array, DSOM will allocate memory for the result in the client's
address space. Ownership of this memory becomes the responsibility of the
client program. When finished using this memory, the client program should
free it using the<B> ORBfree</B> function, rather than<B> free</B> or<B> SOMFree</B>.
This is because the memory has been allocated by DSOM using special memory-management
techniques; therefore, the client should ask DSOM to also free the memory.
If the storage is freed using<B> SOMFree</B> rather than<B> ORBfree,</B> then
memory leaks will result.
<P>
The differences between the<B> SOMFree</B> and<B> ORBfree</B> functions
are twofold:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->First,<B> SOMFree</B> should only be used to
free memory not allocated by DSO(for example, memory the client program
allocated itself using<B> SOMMalloc</B>), while<B> ORBfree</B> should be
used to free memory allocated by DSOM in response to a remote method call.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Second,<B> SOMFee</B> only frees a single block
of memory (in the same way that the C "free" function does), while<B> ORBfree
</B>will free an entire data structure, including any allocated blocks of
memory within in. For example, if a remote method call returns a sequence
of structs, and each struct contains a string,<B> ORBfree</B> will free,
with a single call, not only the sequence's "_buffer" member, but also each
struct and all the strings within the structs. Freeing a similar data structure
using<B> SOMFree</B> would require multiple calls (one for each call to
<B>SOMMalloc</B> used to build the data structure).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some programmers may wish to use a single function to free blocks of memory,
regardless of whether they were allocated locally or by DSOM in response
to a remote method call. For these programmers, DSOM provides a function,
<B>SOMD_NoORBfree,</B> which can be called just after calling<B> SOMD_Init
</B>in the client program. (It requires no arguments and returns no value.)
This function specifies that the client program will free all memory blocks
using<B> SOMFree,</B> rather than<B> ORBfree.</B> In response to this call,
DSOM will not keep track of the memory it allocates for the client. Instead,
it assumes that the client program will be responsible for walking all data
structures returned from remote method calls, while calling<B> SOMFree</B> for
each block of memory within.
