<H1>What is Distributed SOM?</H1><!-- entering slot 213 -->
<P>
Whereas the power of SOM technology comes from the fact that SOM insulates
the client of an object from the object's implementation, the power of DSOM
lies in the fact that DSOM insulates the client of an object from the object's
location.
<P>
Distributed SOM (or DSOM) provides a framework that allows application programs
to access objects across address spaces. That is, application programs can
access objects in other processes, even on different machines. Both the
location and implementation of an object are hidden from a client, and the
client accesses the object (by way of method calls) in the same manner regardless
of its location.
<P>
DSOM currently supports two types of distribution:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->distribution among processes on the same machine
(referred to as Workstation DSOM)<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->and distribution among a network of machines
(referred to as Workgroup DSOM).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>DSOM runs on the AIX (Release 3.2.5 and above) and OS/2 (Release 2.0
and above) operating systems. A Workstation DSOM application can run on
a machine in either environment using core capabilities of the SOMobjects
system. Under the full capability SOMobjects Developer Toolkit, Workgroup
DSOM supports distribution across local area networks comprised of both
OS/2 and AIX systems. Future releases of DSOM may support large, enterprise-wide
networks.
<P>
Support for TCP/IP and NewWare IPX/SPX is provided on AIX, OS/2, and Windows.
 NetBIOS support is provided for OS/2 and Windows. DSOM communications is
extensible in that an application can provide its own transport (see Appendix
C of the SOMobjects Base Toolkit Users Guide).
<P>
DSOM can be viewed in two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->As a System Object Model extension that allows
a program to invoke methods on SOM objects in other processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->As an Object Request Broker (ORB); that is, a
standardized "transport" for distributed object interaction. In this respect,
DSOM complies with the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
specification, published by the Object Management Group (OMG) and x/Open.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This chapter describes DSOM from both perspectives.
