<H1>Using other object implementations</H1><!-- entering slot 301 -->
<P>
As an Object Request Broker, DSOM must support a wide range of object implementations,
including non-SOM implementations. For example, in a print spooler application,
the implementation of a print queue object may be provided by the operating
system, where the methods on the print queue are executable programs or
system commands. As another example, consider an application that uses a
large, existing class library that is not implemented using SOM. Finally,
consider a class library where persistence is implemented by something other
than the Persistence Framework.
<P>
In each of these examples, the application must participate  in object identification,
activation, initialization, and request dispatching. Each server supplies
a server object (derived from<B> SOMDServer</B>) that works in conjunction
with the<B> SOMOA</B> for this purpose.
