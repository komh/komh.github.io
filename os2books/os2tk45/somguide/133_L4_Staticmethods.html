<H1>Static methods</H1><!-- entering slot 163 -->
<P>
These are similar in concept to C++ virtual functions. Static methods are
normally invoked using offset resolution via a method table, as described
above, but all three kinds of method resolution are applicable to static
methods. Each different static method available on an object is given a
different slot in the object's method table. When SOMobjects Toolkit language
bindings are used to implement a class, the SOM IDL<B> method</B> modifier
can be specified to indicate that a given method is static; however, this
modifier is rarely used since it is the default for SOM methods.
<P>
Static methods introduced by a class can be overridden (redefined) by any
descendant classes of the class. When SOMobjects language bindings are used
to implement a class, the SOM IDL<B> override</B> modifier is specified
to indicate that a class overrides a given inherited method. When a static
method is resolved using offset resolution, it is not important which interface
is accessing the method - the actual class of the object determines the
method procedure that is selected.
<P>
Note:  All SOM IDL modifiers are described in the topic "Modifier statements"
in Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler."
