<H1>Creation and destruction of SOM objects</H1><!-- entering slot 285 -->
<P>
The<B> SOMDServer</B> class defines methods for the basic creation of SOM
objects in the server process<B> (somdCreateObj),</B> and for finding the
SOM class object for a specified class<B> (somdGetClassObj).</B> With<B> somdGetClassObj</B>,
a client can get a proxy to a class object on the server, so that methods
introduced in the class's metaclass (for example, class-specific constructors,
etc.) may be invoked directly on the class object. Examples of client use
of these two methods were presented earlier in Sections 6.2 and 6.3.
<P>
With<B> somdDeleteObj</B>, the client can involve the server object in object
destruction. (The methods<B> somdTargetFree</B> and<B> somFree</B> are defined
on the object themselves and do not involve the server object.) Involving
the server object in object creation and destruction can be important for
applications that need more control over how objects are created and destroyed,
or if the application needs to keep track of an object's creation and destruction.
