<H1>A word about memory management</H1><!-- entering slot 374 -->
<P>
Several conventions are built into the SOM Interface Repository with regard
to memory management. You will need to understand these conventions to know
when it is safe and appropriate to free memory references and also when
it is your responsibility to do so.
<P>
All methods that access attributes (such as, the _get_&lt;attribute&gt;
methods) always return either simple values or direct references to data
within the target object. This is necessary because these methods are heavily
used and must be fast and efficient. Consequently, you should never free
any of the memory references obtained through attributes. This memory will
be released automatically when the object that contains it is freed.
<P>
For all methods that give out object references (there are five:<B> within,
contents, lookup_name, lookup_id,</B> and<B> describe_contents</B>), when
finished with the object, you are expected to release the object reference
by invoking the<U><I> somFree</I></U> method. (This is illustrated in the
sample program that accesses all Interface Repository objects.) Do not release
the object reference until you have either copied or finished using all
of the information obtained from the object.
<P>
The<B> describe</B> methods (<B>describe, describe_contents,</B> and<B> describe_interface</B>)
return structures and sequences that contain information. The actual structures
returned by these methods are passed by value (and hence should only be
freed if you have allocated the memory used to receive them). However, you
may be required to free some of the information contained in the returned
structures when you are finished. Consult the specific method in the<I> SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit: Programmers Reference Manual</I> for more details about
what to free.
<P>
During execution of the<B> describe</B> and<B> lookup</B> methods, sometimes
intermediate objects are activated automatically. These objects are kept
in an internal cache of objects that are in use, but for which no explicit
object references have been returned as results. Consequently, there is
no way to identify or free these objects individually. However, whenever
your program is finished using all of the information obtained thus far
from the Interface Repository, invoking the<U><I> release_cache</I></U> method
causes the Interface Repository to purge its internal cache of these implicitly
referenced objects. This cache will replenish itself automatically if the
need to do so subsequently arises.
