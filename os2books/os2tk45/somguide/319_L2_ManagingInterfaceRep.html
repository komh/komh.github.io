<H1>Managing Interface Repository files</H1><!-- entering slot 365 -->
<P>
Just as the number of interface definitions contained in a single IDL source
file is optional, similarly, the number of IDL files compiled into one interface
repository file is also at the programmer's discretion. Commonly, however,
all interfaces needed for a single project or class framework are kept in
one interface repository.
