<H1>Generating output</H1><!-- entering slot 70 -->
<P>
The following functions and methods are used to generate output, including
descriptions of SOM objects. They all produce their output using the character-output
procedure held by the global variable<B> SOMOutCharRoutine</B>. The default
procedure for character output simply writes the character to<I> stdout</I>,
but it can be replaced to change the output destination of the methods and
functions below. (See Chapter 5 for more information on customizing SOM.)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>somDumpSelf</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> (method) writes a detailed description
of an object, including its class, its location, and its instance data.
The receiver of the method is the object to be dumped. An additional argument
is the "nesting level" for the description. [All lines in the description
will be indented by (2 * level) spaces.]<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somPrintSelf
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>(method) Writes a brief description of an object,
including its class and location in memory. The receiver of the method is
the object to be printed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somPrintf</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> (function)
SOM's version of the C "printf" function. It generates character stream
output via<B> SOMOutCharRoutine</B>. It has the same interface as the C
"printf" function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somVprintf</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> (function)
Represents the "vprint" form of<B> somPrintf</B>. Its arguments are a formatting
string and a<B> va_list</B> holding the remaining arguments.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somPrefixLevel
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>(function) Generates (via<B> somPrintf</B>)
spaces to prefix a line at the indicated level. The return type is<B> void</B>.
The argument is an integer specifying the level. The number of spaces generated
is (2 * level).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B> somLPrintf</B> <!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> (function)
Combines<B> somPrefixLevel</B> and<B> somPrintf.</B> The first argument
is the level of the description (as for<B> somPrefixLevel</B>) and the remaining
arguments are as for<B> somPrintf</B> (or for the C "printf" function).
