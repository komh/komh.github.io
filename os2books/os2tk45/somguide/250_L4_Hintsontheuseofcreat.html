<H1>Hints on the use of create vs. create_constant</H1><!-- entering slot 287 -->
<P>
Enough context now exists so that the following question may be answered:
"If object references constructed with<B> create</B> support changeable
<B>ReferenceData</B>, but object references constructed with<B> create_constant
</B>do not, why would I ever want to use<B> create_constant</B>?"
<P>
Invocations of<B> create</B> add entries to a table called the<I> ReferenceData
Table.</I> The ReferenceData Table is persistent; that is,<B> ReferenceData
</B>saved in it persists between server activations. Two calls to<B> create
</B>with the same arguments do not return the same<B> SOMDObject</B> (per
CORBA 1.1 specifications) That is, if create is called twice with the same
arguments, two entries in the ReferenceData Table will be created. If a
server using<B> create</B> wishes to avoid cluttering up the ReferenceData
Table with multiple references to the same object, it must maintain a table
of its own to keep track of the references it has created to avoid calling
<B>create</B> twice with the same arguments.
<P>
The<B> create_constant</B> method stores the<B> ReferenceData</B> as part
of the<B> SOMDObject's</B> state; that is, it does not add entries to the
ReferenceData Table. The<B> create_constant</B> method, then, might be used
by a server that does not want to maintain a table of references nor pay
the penalty of cluttering up the ReferenceData Table with multiple entries.
