<P>
To implement a method, add code to the body of the stub procedure.  In addition
to standard C or C++ code, class implementers can also use any of the functions,
methods, and macros SOM provides for manipulating classes and objects. Chapter
3, "Using SOM Classes in Client Programs," discusses these functions, methods,
and macros.
<P>
In addition to the functions, methods, and macros SOM provides for both
class clients and class implementers, SOM provides two facilities especially
for class implementers. They are for (1) accessing instance variables of
the object responding to the method and (2) making parent method calls,
as follows.
