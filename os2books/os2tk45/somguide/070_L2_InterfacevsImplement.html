<H1>Interface vs Implementation</H1><!-- entering slot 87 -->
<P>
The<I> interface</I> to a class of objects contains the information that
a client must know to use an object-namely, the names of its attributes
and the signatures of its methods.  The interface is described in a formal
language independent of the programming language used to implement the object's
methods. In SOM, the formal language used to define object interfaces is
the<B> Interface Definition Language</B> (IDL), standardized by CORBA.
<P>
The<I> implementation</I> of a class of objects (that is, the procedures
that implement methods) is written in the implementer's preferred programming
language. This language can be object-oriented (for instance, C++) or procedural
(for instance, C).
<P>
A completely implemented class definition, then, consists of two main files:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An IDL specification of the interface to instances
of the class (the<I> interface definition file</I> (or .idl file) and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Method procedures written in the implementer's language
of choice (the<I> implementation file</I>).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The interface definition file has an .idl extension, as noted. The implementation
file, however, has an extension specific to the language in which it is
written. For example, implementations written in C have a .c extension,
and implementations written in C++ have a .C (for AIX) or .cpp (for OS/2)
extension.
<P>
To assist users in implementing SOM classes, the SOMobjects Toolkit provides
a SOM Compiler. The SOM Compiler takes as input an object interface definition
file  (the .idl file) and produces a set of<I> binding files</I> that make
it convenient to implement and use a SOM class whose instances are objects
that support the defined interface. The binding files and their purposes
are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An<I> implementation template</I> that serves as a
guide for how the implementation file for the class should look. The class
implementer fills in this template file with language-specific code to implement
the methods that are available on the class' instances.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>Header files</I> to be included (a) in the class's
implementation file and (b) in client programs that use the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These binding files produced by the SOM Compiler bridge the gap between
 SOM and the object model used in object-oriented languages (such as C++),
and they allow SOM to be used with non-object-oriented languages (such as
C). The SOM Compiler currently produces binding files for the C and C++
programming languages. SOM can also be used with other programming languages;
the bindings simply offer a more convenient programmer's interface to SOM.
Vendors of other languages may also offer SOM bindings; check with your
language vendor for possible SOM support.
<P>
The subsequent sections of this chapter provide full syntax for SOM IDL
and the SOM Compiler.
