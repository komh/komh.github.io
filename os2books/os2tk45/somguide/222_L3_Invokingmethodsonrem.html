<H1>Invoking methods on remote objects</H1><!-- entering slot 259 -->
<P>
As described earlier, DSOM proxies are local representatives of remote objects,
and as such, they can be treated like the target objects themselves. Method
calls are invoked in exactly the same manner as if the object is local.
This is true both for method calls using the<I> static bindings</I> (as
most of our examples have shown), as well as for<I> dynamic dispatching
</I>calls, where SOM facilities (such as the somDispatch method) are used
to construct method calls at run time.
<P>
CORBA 1.1 also defines a dynamic invocation interface that is implemented
by DSOM. It is described later in section 6.9, "Advanced Topics".
<P>
The DSOM run time is responsible for transporting any input method argument
values supplied by the caller (defined by legal IDL types) to the target
object in a remote call. Likewise, the DSOM run time transports the return
value and any output argument values back to the caller following the method
call.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> DSOM uses the Interface Repository (IR) to discover the "signature"
of a method (that is, the method's prototype). It is important that the
contents of the IR match the method bindings used by the application program
(i.e. the same IDL file is used to update the IR and to generate bindings).

<P>
DSOM can make remote invocations only of methods whose parameter types are
among the following IDL types:  basic types<B> (short, long, unsigned short,
unsigned long, float, double, char, boolean, octet), enum, struct, union,
sequence, string, array, any,</B> and<B> object.</B> The members of a<B> struct,
union, sequence,</B> or<B> array</B> and the value of an<B> any,</B> must
also be from the above list of supported DSOM types.
<P>
In addition to the preceding types, DSOM also supports method parameters
of type<B> pointer</B> to one of the above types (for example,<B> long*</B>)
Pointers to<B> pointers</B> are not supported, however, and<B> pointers
</B>embedded within one of the above types (for example, a<B> pointer</B> within
a<B> struct</B>) are not supported The<B> "void *"</B> type is also not
supported. Currently, DSOM has the limitation that NULL<B> pointer</B> values
cannot be returned as<B> inout</B> or<B> out</B> method arguments although
it is expected that this limitation will be addressed in a future release.

<P>
Types declared as SOMFOREIGN types are not currently supported by DSOM.
Because the SOM<B> somI</B> is declared as a SOMFOREIGN type, this implies
that any method having a parameter of type<B> somId</B> cannot be invoked
remotely using DSOM. This restriction includes the  SOM methods:<B> somRespondsTo,
somSupportsMethod, somGetMethodDescriptor, somGetMethodIndex,</B> and<B> somGetNthMethodInfo.
</B>
<P>
When a method parameter is an<B> object</B> type (that is, an instance of
<B>SOMObject</B> or some class derived from<B> SOMObject</B>), a client
program making a remote invocation of that method must pass an object reference
for that parameter, rather than passing a local<B> SOMObject</B>, unless
the client program is also DSOM server program, in which case DSOM will
automatically convert the local object into an object reference.
<P>
Methods having the<B> procedure</B> SOM IDL modifier cannot be invoked remotely
using DSOM.  This is because these "methods" are called directly, rather
than via the normal method resolution mechanisms on which DSOM relies.
