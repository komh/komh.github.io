<H1>Identifying the source of a request</H1><!-- entering slot 292 -->
<P>
CORBA 1.1 specifies that a Basic Object Adapter should provide a facility
for identifying the<I> principal</I> (or user) on whose behalf a request
is being performed. The<B> get_principal</B> method, defined by<B> BOA</B> and
impleented by<B> SOMOA</B> returns a<B> Principal</B> object, which identifies
the caller of a particular method. From this information, an application
can perform access control checking.
<P>
In CORBA 1.1, the interface to<B> Principal</B> is not defined, and is left
up to the ORB implementation. In the current release of DSOM, a<B> Principal
</B>object is defined to have two attributes:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
userName (string)<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Identifies the name of the user
who invoked a request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> hostName (string)<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Identifies
the name of the host from which the request originated.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Currently, the value of the<B> UserName</B> attribute is obtained from the
USER environment variable in the calling process. Likewise, the<B> hostName
</B>attribute is obtained from the HOSTNAME environment variable. This facility
is intended to provide basic information about the source of a request,
and currently, is<I> not</I> based on any specific authentication (i.e.,
"login") scheme. More rigorous authentication and security mechanisms will
be considered for future DSOM implementations.
<P>
The IDL prototype for the<B> get_principal</B> method, defined on<B> BOA
(SOMOA)</B> is as follows:
<PRE>Principal  <B>get_principal</B> (in SOMDObject obj,                           in Environment *req_ev);
</PRE>

<P>
This call will typically be made either by the target object or by the server
object, when a method call is received. The<B> get_principal</B> method
uses the Environment structure associated with the request, and an object
reference for the target object, to produce a<B> Principal</B> object that
define the request initiator.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> CORBA 1.1 defines a "tk_Principal"<B> TypeCode</B> which is
used to identify the type of<B> Principal</B> object arguments in requests,
in case special handling is needed when building the request. Currently,
DSOM does not provide any special handling of objects of type "tk_Principal";
they are treated like any other object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
