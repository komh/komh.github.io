<H1>Verifying the DSOM environment with 'somdchk'</H1><!-- entering slot 318 -->
<P>
The<B> somdchk</B> program evaluates the environment to verify whether DSOM
can operate correctly. As described in the preceding topic s of Sections
6.5 "Implementing Classes" and 6.6 "Configuring DSOM Applications," to  operate
correctly DSOM must be able to find the appropriate libraries (DLLs), the
Interface Repository, and the Implementation Repository. The settings of
various environment variables help DSOM find the path to the libraries and
repositories.
<P>
The<B> somdchk</B> program generates messages that evaluate the DSOM environment.
It determines whether the necessary SOM DLLs can be located, whether DSOM
is enabled for workgroup (cross-machine) communication, whether Interface
and Implementation Repositories can be located, and it displays the settings
of important environment variables. In its "verbose" mode,<B> somdchk</B> gives
the default settings for DSOM environment variables and explains how DSOM
uses them.
<P>
On AIX or OS/2, the program is invoked from the command line using the syntax
given below. The optional verbose setting can be turned on by including
the<B> -v</B> option with the command:
<PRE><B>somdchk  [-v]</B>
</PRE>

<P>
On Windows, the<B> somdchk</B> program can be invoked by double clicking
on the SOMDCHK icon. The resulting messages will appear in the message window.

<P>
The following example shows sample output from the<B> somdchk -v</B>  command
on AIX. Output on other platforms would look similar.

SOMBASE = /usr/lpp/som
SOMBASE should not be set to the base directory of the SOMObjects Toolkit Enablers.

Searching for important DLLs.....
/usr/lpp/som/lib/som.dll found.
/usr/lpp/som/lib/somd.dll found.
/usr/lpp/som/lib/soms.dll found.
/usr/lpp/som/lib/somst.dll found.

/usr/lpp/som/lib/somd.dll IS Workgroup Enabled.
Workgroup Enabled DLL permits inter-machine communication.

SOMSOCKETS  = TCPIPSockets
SOMSOCKETS must be set. Valid settings are:
   TCPIPSockets for TCPIP.
   IPXSockets for NetWare.

SOMDDIR    = /u/raviv/impl_rep/
Valid Implementation Repository found in /u/raviv/impl_rep/
SOMDDIR may be set to a valid directory in which the Implementation Repository
resides.
   Default is /usr/lpp/som/etc/dsom


SOMIR    = /u/raviv/raviv.ir
SOMIR may be set to a list of file names which together form the Interface
Repository.
   Default is ./som.ir
/u/raviv/raviv.ir found.

SOMDPORT   = 3001
SOMDPORT may be set to a 'well-known port'. Default value is 9393.

SOMDTIMEOUT  = (null).
SOMDTIMEOUT may be set to the number of seconds to timeout.
   Default value is 600.

SOMDDEBUG    = 2
SOMDDEBUG may be set to 1 to enable runtime error messages.
   Default value is 0.

SOMDMESSAGELOG    = (null).
SOMDMESSAGELOG may be set to the name of a file where messages may be logged.
   Default is stdout.
