<H1>Passing object references in method calls</H1><!-- entering slot 261 -->
<P>
When pointers to objects are returned as method output values (as in the
previous examples), DSOM automatically converts the object pointers (in
the server) to object proxies in the client.
<P>
Likewise, when a client passes object (proxy) pointers as input arguments
to a method, DSOM automatically converts the proxy argument in the client
to an appropriate object reference in the server.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the proxy is for an object that is in the same server as
the target object, DSOM gives the object reference to the server object
for resolution to a SOM object pointer. Otherwise, DSOM leaves the proxy
alone, since the proxy must refer to an object in some process other than
the target's server.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
