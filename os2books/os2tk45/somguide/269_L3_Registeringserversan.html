<P>
<B>Implementation definitions:</B>
<P>
The Implementation Repository holds<B> ImplementationDef</B> objects The
<B>ImplementationDef</B> class defines attributes necessary for the<B> SOMOA
</B>to find and activate the implementation of an object. Details of the
<B>ImplementationDef</B> object are not currently defined in the CORBA 1.1
specification; the attributes that have been defined are required by DSOM.

<P>
Listed below is each available attribute, with its corresponding type in
parentheses, followed by a description of its purpose:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
impl_id (string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains the DSOM-generated identifier
for a server implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_alias (string)
<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL>Contains the "alias" (user-friendly name) for a
server implementation.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_program (string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains
the name of the program or command file which will be executed when a process
for this server is started automatically by somdd. If the full pathname
is not specified, the directories specified in the  PATH environment variable
will be searched for the named program or command file.
<P>
Optionally, the server program can be run under control of a "shell" or
debugger, by specifying the shell or debugger name first, followed by the
name of the server program. (A space separates the two program names.)  For
example,
<PRE>                dbx myprogram
</PRE>

<P>
will start the program "myprogram" under control of "dbx".
<P>
Servers that are started automatically by somdd will always be passed their
impl_id as the first parameter, in order to retrieve their ImplementationDef
(if desired).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_flags (Flags)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains
a bit-vector of flags used to identify server options (for example, the
IMPLDEF_MULTI_THREAD flag indicates multi-threading). See the impldef.idl
file for the complete set of valid<B> ImplementationDef</B> flags. Unused
flag bits are reserved for future use by IBM.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_server_class
(string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains the name of the<B> SOMDServer
</B>class or subclass created by the server process.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_refdata_file
(string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains the full pathname of the file
used to store<B> ReferenceData</B> for the server.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_refdata_bkup
(string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains the full pathname of the backup
mirror file used to store<B> ReferenceData</B> for the server. This file
can be used to restore a copy of the primary file in case it becomes corrupted.
(It would be a good idea to keep the primary and backup files in different
disk volumes.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> impl_hostname (string)<!-- lm: 0x2 31 -->
<UL> Contains
the hostname of the machine where the server is located.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
