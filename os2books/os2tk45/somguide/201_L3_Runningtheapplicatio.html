<P>
Before running a DSOM application, the DSOM daemon,<B> somdd</B>, must be
started.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On AIX or OS/2, the daemon can be started manually
from the command line, or it could be started automatically from a start-up
script run at boot time. It may be run in the background with the commands
<B>somdd&amp;</B> on AIX and<B> start somdd</B> on OS/2. (The<B> somdd</B> program
requires no parameters. An optional<B> -q</B> parameter can be used to set
"quiet" mode, to suppress messages.)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On Windows, the daemon can be started with the<B> DSOM
Daemon</B> icon in the SOM icon group or started in Windows from the Run
option of the file menu.  The<B> DSOM Daemon</B> icon will change colors
to indicate the daemon is ready,  after which client and server programs
can be started.
<P>
The<B> somdd</B> daemon is responsible for establishing a "binding" (that
is, a connection) between a client process and a server.  It will activate
the desired server automatically, if necessary. The server can also be started
manually prior to starting the client program, using the command<B> dsom
start stackServer</B>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
<B><I>Running the client</B></I>
<P>
Once the DSOM daemon is running, the application may be started. This is
accomplished by running the client program. If the StackServer is not running,
it will be started automatically by the DSOM daemon when the client attempts
to invoke a method on one of its objects. After the client program ends,
the server will continue to run, accepting connections from new clients.
To terminate the server, use the command<B> dsom stop stackServer</B>.
