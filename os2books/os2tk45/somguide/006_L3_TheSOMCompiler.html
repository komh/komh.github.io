<H1>The SOM Compiler</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
The<B> SOMobjects Toolkit</B> contains a tool, called the<B> SOM Compiler,
</B>that helps implementers build classes in which interface and implementation
are decoupled. The SOM Compiler reads the IDL definition of a class interface
and generates:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->an implementation skeleton for the class,<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->bindings for implementers, and<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->bindings for client programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<I>Bindings</I> are language-specific macros and procedures  that make implementing
and using SOM classes more convenient. These bindings offer a convenient
interface to SOM that is tailored to a particular programming language.
 For instance, C programmers can invoke methods in the same way they make
ordinary procedure calls. The C++ bindings "wrap" SOM objects as C++ objects,
so that C++ programmers can invoke methods on SOM objects in the same way
they invoke methods on C++ objects. In addition, SOM objects receive full
C++ typechecking, just as C++ objects do.  Currently, the SOM Compiler can
generate both C and C++ language bindings for a class. The C and C++ bindings
will work with a variety of commercial products available from IBM and others.
Vendors of other programming languages may also offer SOM bindings.  Check
with your language vendor about possible SOM support.
