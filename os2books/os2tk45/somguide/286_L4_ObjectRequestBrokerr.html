<H1>Object Request Broker run-time interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 327 -->
<P>
In the previous sections, the<B> SOMDObjectMgr</B> and<B> SOMDServer</B> classes
were introduced. These are classes defined by DSOM to provide basic support
in managing objects in a distributed application. These classes are built
upon Object Request Broker interfaces defined  by  CORBA for building and
dispatching requests on objects. The ORB interfaces,<B> SOMDObjectMgr</B> and
<B>SOMDServer,</B> together provide the support for implementing distributed
applications in DSOM.
<P>
CORBA 1.1 defines the interfaces to the ORB components in IDL. In DSOM,
the ORB components are implemented as SOM classes whose interfaces are expressed
using the same CORBA 1.1 IDL. Thus, an application can make calls to the
DSOM run time using the SOM language bindings of its choice.
<P>
Interfaces for the following ORB run-time components are defined in CORBA
1.1, and are implemented in DSOM. They are introduced briefly here, and
discussed in more detail throughout this chapter. (See the<I> SOMobjects
Developer Toolkit: Programmers Reference Manual</I> for the complete interface
definitions.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Object<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL> The<B> Object</B> interface defines operations
on an "object reference", which is the information needed to specify an
object within the ORB.
<P>
In DSOM, the class<B> SOMDObject</B> implements the CORBA 1.1<B> Object
</B>interface. (The<B>"SOMD"</B> prefix was added to distinguish this class
from<B> SOMObject.)</B> The subclass<B> SOMDClientProxy</B> extends<B> SOMDObject
</B>with support for proxy objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ORB<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL> (Object
Request Broker) The ORB interface defines utility routines for building
requests and saving references to distributed objects. The global variable
<B>SOMD_ORBObject</B> is initialized by<B> SOMD_Init</B> and provides the
reference to the ORB object.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ImplementationDef<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL> An
<B>ImplementationDef</B> object is used to describe an object's implementation.
Typically, the<B> ImplementationDef</B> describes the program that implements
an object's server, how the program is activated, and so on.
<P>
(CORBA 1.1 introduces<B> ImplementationDef</B> as the name of the interface,
but leaves the remainder of the IDL specification to the particular ORB.
DSOM defines an interface for<B> ImplementationDef.)</B>
<P>
<B>ImplementationDef</B> objects are stored in the Implementation Repository
(defined in DSOM by the<B> ImplRepository</B> class).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> InterfaceDef
<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL>An<B> InterfaceDef</B> object is used to describe
an IDL interface in a manner that can be queried and manipulated at run
time when building requests dynamically, for example.
<P>
<B>InterfaceDef</B> objects are stored in the Interface Repository (described
fully in Chapter 7, "The Interface Repository Framework").<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Request
<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL>A<B> Request</B> object represents a specific request
on an object, constructed at run-time. The<B> Request</B> object contains
the target object reference, operation (method) name, a list of input and
output arguments. A<B> Request</B> can be invoked synchronously (wait for
the response), asynchronously (initiate the call, and later, get the response),
or as a "oneway" call (no response expected).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> NVList
<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL>An<B> NVList</B> is a list of<B> NamedValue</B> structures,
used primarily in building<B> Request</B> objects. A<B> NamedValue</B> structure
consists of a name, typed value, and some flags indicating how to interpret
the value, how to allocate/free the value's memory, and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Context
<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL>A<B> Context</B> object contains a list of "properties"
that represent information about an application process's environment. Each
<B>Context</B> property consists of a &lt;name,string_value&gt; pair,and
is used by application programs or methods much like the "environment variables"
commonly found in operating systems like AIX and OS/2 and Windows. IDL method
interfaces can explicitly list which properties are queried by a method,
and the ORB will pass those property values to a remote target object when
making a request.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Principal<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL> A
<B>Principal</B> object identifies the<!-- entering slot 328 --> principal
("user") on whose behalf a request is being performed.
<P>
(CORBA 1.1 introduces the name of the interface,<B> Principal,</B> but leaves
the remainder of the IDL specification to the particular ORB. DSOM defines
an interface for<B> Principal.)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> BOA<!-- lm: 0x2 22 -->
<UL> (Basic
Object Adapter) An Object Adapter provides the primary interface between
an implementation and the ORB "core". An ORB may have a number of Object
Adapters, with interfaces that are appropriate for specific kinds of objects.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<B> Basic Object Adapter</B> is intended to be a general-purpose Object
Adapter available on all CORBA-compliant Object Request Brokers. The<B> BOA
</B>interface provides support for generation of object references, identification
of the principal making a call, activation and deactivation of objects and
implementations, and method invocation on objects.
<P>
In DSOM,<B> BOA</B> is defined as an abstract class. The<B> SOMOA</B> (SOM
Object Adapter) class, derived from<B> BOA,</B> is DSOM's primary Object
Adapter implementation. The<B> SOMOA</B> interface extends the<B> BOA</B> interface
with several of its own methods that are not defined by CORBA 1.1.
