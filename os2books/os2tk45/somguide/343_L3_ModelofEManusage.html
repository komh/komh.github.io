<H1>Model of EMan usage</H1><!-- entering slot 392 -->
<P>
The programming model of EMan is similar to that of many GUI toolkits. The
main program initializes EMan and then registers interest in various types
of events. The main program ends by calling a non-returning function of
EMan that waits for events and dispatches them as and when they occur. In
short, the model includes steps that:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initialize the Event Manager,<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Register with EMan for all events of interest,
and<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Hand over control to EMan to loop forever and
to dispatch events.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Event Manager is a SOM object and is an instance of the<B> SOMEEMan
</B>class. Since any application requires only one instance of this object,
the<B> SOMEEMan</B> class is an instance of the<B> SOMMSingleInstance</B> class.
Creation and initialization of the Event Manager is accomplished by a function
call to<B> SOMEEmanNew</B>.
<P>
Currently, EMan supports the four kinds of events described in the following
topic. An application can register or unregister for events in a callback
routine (explained below) even after control has been turned over to EMan.
