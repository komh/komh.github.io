<H1>Initializing the DSOM run-time environment</H1><!-- entering slot 275 -->
<P>
The first thing the server program should do is to initialize the DSOM run
time by calling the<B> SOMD_Init</B> function. This causes the various DSOM
run-time objects to be created and initialized, including the Implementation
Repository (accessible via the global variable<B> SOMD_ImplRepObject</B>),
which is used in the next initialization step.
