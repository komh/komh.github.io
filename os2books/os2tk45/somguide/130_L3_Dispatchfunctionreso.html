<P>
Dispatch-function resolution is the slowest, but most flexible, of the three
method-resolution techniques. Dispatch functions permit method resolution
to be based on arbitrary rules associated with the class of which the receiving
object is an instance. Thus, a class implementor has complete freedom in
determining how methods invoked on its instances are resolved.
<P>
With both offset and name-lookup resolution, the net effect is the same-the
method procedure that is ultimately selected is the one supported by the
class of which the receiver is an instance. For example, if the receiver
is an instance of class "Dog", then Dog's method procedure will be selected;
but if the receiver is an instance of class "BigDog", then BigDog's method
procedure will be selected.
<P>
By contrast, dispatch-function resolution allows a class of instances to
be defined such that the method procedure is selected using some other criteria.
For example, the method procedure could be selected on the basis of the
arguments to the method call, rather than on the receiver. For more information
on dispatch-function resolution, see the description and examples for the
