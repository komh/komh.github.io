<H1>Inheritance</H1><!-- entering slot 155 -->
<P>
One of the defining aspects of an object model is its characterization of
inheritance. This section describes SOM's model for inheritance.
<P>
A class in SOM defines an implementation for objects that support a specific
interface:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> interface</I> defines the methods supported
by objects of the class, and is specified using SOM IDL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> implementation</I>  defines what instance variables
implement an object's state and what procedures implement its methods.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
New classes are derived (by subclassing) from previously existing classes
through inheritance, specialization, and addition.  Subclasses inherit interface
from their parent classes: any method available on instances of a class
is also available on instances of any class derived from it (either directly
or indirectly).  Subclasses also inherit implementation (the procedures
that implement the methods) from their parent classes<I> unless</I> the
methods are<I> overridden</I> (redefined or specialized). In addition, a
subclass may introduce new instance methods and instance variables that
will be inherited by other classes derived from it.
<P>
SOM also supports<I> multiple inheritance</I>. That is, a class may be derived
from (and may inherit interface and implementation from) multiple parent
classes. Note: Multiple inheritance is available only to SOM classes whose
interfaces are specified in IDL, and not to SOM classes whose interfaces
are specified in SOM's earlier interface definition language, OIDL. See
Appendix B for information on how to automatically convert existing OIDL
files to IDL.
<P>
It is possible under multiple inheritance to encounter potential conflicts
or ambiguities with respect to inheritance. All multiple inheritance models
must face these issues, and resolve the ambiguities in some way. For example,
when multiple inheritance is allowed, it is possible that a class will inherit
the same method or instance variable from different parents (because each
of these parents has some common ancestor that introduces the method or
instance variable). In this situation, a SOM subclass inherits only one
implementation of the method or instance variable. (The implementation of
an instance variable within an object is just the location where it is stored.
The implementation of a method is a procedure pointer, stored within a method
table.) The following illustration addresses the question of which method
implementation would be inherited.
<P>
Consider this situation: Class "W" defines a method "foo", implemented by
procedure "proc1". Class "W" has two subclasses, "X" and "Y". Subclass "Y"
overrides the implementation of "foo" with procedure "proc2". Subclass "X"
does not override "foo"<I>.</I> In addition, classes "X" and "Y" share a
common subclass, "Z". That is, the IDL interface statement for class "Z"
lists its parents as "X" and "Y" in that order. (These relationships form
a diamond shape, with class "W" at the top.)
<P>
The question is thus: which implementation of method "foo" does class "Z"
inherit-procedure "proc1" defined by class "W", or procedure "proc2" defined
by class "Y"? The procedure for performing inheritance that is defined by
SOMClass resolves this ambiguity by using the<I> left path precedence</I> rule:
when the same method is inherited from multiple ancestors, the procedure
used to support the method is the one used by the<U> leftmost ancestor</U> from
which the method is inherited. (The ordering of parent classes is determined
by the order in which the class implementor lists the parents in the IDL
specification for the class.)
<P>
Class "Z" inherits the implementation of method "foo" defined by class "W"
(procedure "proc1"), rather than the implementation defined by class "Y"
(procedure "proc2"), because "X" is the leftmost ancestor of "Z" from which
the method "foo" is inherited. This rule may be interpreted as giving priority
to classes whose instance interfaces are mentioned first in IDL interface
definitions.
<P>
If a class implementor decides that the default inherited implementation
is not appropriate (for example, procedure "proc2" is desired), then SOM
IDL allows the class designer to select the parent whose implementation
is desired. For more information concerning this approach, see the<B> Select
</B>modifier, which is documented in the topic "Modifier statements" in
Chapter 4, "SOM IDL and the SOM Compiler."
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Alternatively, an explicit metaclass for "Z" could be introduced
to change the way methods are inherited.<!-- entering slot 156 --> However,
this would be a fairly serious step to take-it would also affect the semantics
of inheritance for all of Z's descendant classes.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
Another conflict that may arise with the use of multiple inheritance is
when two ancestors of a class define different methods (in general, with
different signatures) of the same name. For example, suppose Class "X" defines
a method "bar" with type<I> T1</I>, and class "Y" defines a method "bar"
with type<I> T2</I>. Class "Z" is derived from both "X" and "Y", and "Z"
does not override method "bar".
<P>
This example illustrates a method name that is "overloaded"-that is, used
to name two entirely different methods (note that overloading is completely
unrelated to overriding). This is not necessarily a difficult problem to
handle. Indeed, the run-time SOM API allows the construction of a class
that supports the two different "bar" methods. (They are implemented using
two different method-table entries, each of which is associated with its
introducing class.)
<P>
However, the interface to instances of such classes can<U> not</U> be defined
using IDL. IDL specifically forbids the definition of interfaces in which
method names are overloaded.  Furthermore, within SOM itself, the use of
such classes can lead to anomalous behavior unless care is taken to avoid
the use of name-lookup method resolution (discussed in the following section),
since, in this case, a method name alone does not identify a unique method.
For this reason, (statically declared) multiple-inheritance classes in SOM
are currently restricted to those whose instance interfaces can be defined
using IDL. Thus, the above example cannot be constructed with the aid of
the SOM Compiler.
