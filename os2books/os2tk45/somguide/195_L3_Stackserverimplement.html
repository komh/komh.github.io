<H1>"Stack" server implementation</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->
<P>
A server consists of three parts. First, a "main" program, when run, provides
an address space for the objects it manages, and one or more process "threads"
that can execute method calls. (Windows and AIX currently do not have multi-thread
support, while OS/2 and AIX 4.1 do.) Second, a server object, derived from
the<B> SOMDServer</B> class, provides methods used to manage objects in
the server process. Third, one or more class libraries provide object implementations.
Usually these libraries are constructed as<I> dynamically linked libraries
</I>(DLLs), so they can be loaded and linked by a server program dynamically.

<P>
In this simple example, we can use the default DSOM server program, which
is already compiled and linked. The default server behaves as a simple server,
in that it simply receives and executes requests continuously. The default
server creates its server object from the class,<B> SOMDServer</B>. The
default server will load any class libraries it needs upon demand.
<P>
The "Stack" class library, "stack.dll", can be used without modification
in the distributed application. This is possible because the "Stack" class
is "well formed"; in other words,<I> there are no methods that implicitly
assume the client and the object are in the same address space.</I>
<P>
Thus, by using the default server and the existing class library, a simple
"Stack" server can be provided without any additional programming!
<P>
An application may require more functionality in the server program or the
server object than the default implementations provide. A discussion on
how to implement server programs and server objects is found later in this
chapter, in section 6.4, "Basic Server Programming".
