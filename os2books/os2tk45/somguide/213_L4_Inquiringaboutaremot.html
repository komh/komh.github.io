<H1>Inquiring about a remote object's implementation</H1><!-- entering slot 250 -->
<P>
A client may wish to inquire about the (server) implementation of a remote
object. All objects in a server, including the "server object", share the
same implementation definition. This is common when using the<B> somdFindServersByClass
</B>call, where a sequence of server proxies is returned, and some choice
must be made about which to use.
<P>
When a proxy is obtained by a client, the client can inquire about the underlying
server implementation by obtaining its corresponding<B> ImplementationDef</B>.
An<B> ImplementationDef</B> object  contains a set of attributes that describe
a server implementation. To get the<B> ImplementationDef</B> associated
with a remote object, the<B> get_implementation</B> method (implemented
on<B> SOMDObject</B> and inherited by<B> SOMDClientProxy</B>) can be called.

<P>
For example, if a program has a proxy for a remote server object, it can
get the ImplementationDef for the server with method calls similar to the
following:
<PRE>
    ImplementationDef implDef;
    SOMDServer server;

    ...
    implDef = _get_implementation(server, &amp;ev);

</PRE>

<P>
Once the<B> ImplementationDef</B> has been obtained, the application can
access its attributes using the<B> _get_impl_xxx</B> methods.
<P>
The<B> ImplementationDef</B> class is discussed further in section 6.6,
"Configuring DSOM."
