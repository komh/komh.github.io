<P>
The Event Management framework can be used from C++ just like any other
framework in the SOMobjects Toolkit. You must ensure that the C++ usage
bindings (that is, the .xh files) are available for the Event Management
Framework classes. These .xh files are generated by the SOM Compiler in
the SOMobjects Toolkit when the<B> -s</B> option includes an xh emitter.
