<H1>Compatibility with DPI 1.x Base Code</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
If you have DPI 1.x based code, you may choose to keep using the old DPI
1.x dpi\snmp_dpi.h include file and the old DPI 1.x functions as provided
in DPI32DLL.LIB and DPI32DLL.DLL.  You will be able to communicate with
the OS/2 SNMP agent which implements DPI 2.0.
<P>
In <A HREF="075_L1_MigratingYourSNMPDPI.html">Migrating Your DPI Subagent
to DPI 2.0</A>, the changes that you must make to your DPI 1.x source are
presented.  If you take a few minutes to look at it, you will see that this
is not too big a task.
