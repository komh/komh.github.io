<P>
A subagent can send an ARE_YOU_THERE packet to the agent.  This may be useful
to do if you have a DPI "connection" over an unreliable transport protocol,
such as UDP.
<P>
If the "connection" is in a healthy state, the agent responds with a RESPONSE
packet with SNMP_ERROR_DPI_noError.  If the "connection" is not in a healthy
state, the agent may respond with a RESPONSE packet with an error indication,
but the agent might not react at all.  In this situation, you would timeout
while waiting for a response.
