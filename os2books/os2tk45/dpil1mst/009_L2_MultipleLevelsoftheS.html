<H1>Multiple Levels of the SNMP DPI API</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
For the SNMP DPI 2.0 API, some functions are implemented as macros, because
the older DPI Version 1.x had the same function names with different parameters.
 The new implementation has new function names, which are not always the
most intuitive.  By defining the macros with the more natural names for
the functions, the non-intuitive names are hidden.  This was done because
the macros have the same names as the functions were named in DPI Version
1.  It is thus possible to provide either the DPI 1.x or the DPI 2.x API
by properly defining the macros.
