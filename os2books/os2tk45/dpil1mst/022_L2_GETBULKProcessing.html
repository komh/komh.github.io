<P>
You can ask the agent to translate GETBULK requests into multiple GETNEXT
requests.  This is basically the default and is specified in the DPI REGISTER
packet.  In principle, we expect the majority of DPI subagents to run on
the same machine as the agent, or on the same physical network.  Therefore,
repetitive GETNEXT requests remain local and, in general, should not be
a problem.
<P>
Otherwise, the subagent can tell the agent to pass on a DPI GETBULK packet.

<P>
When a GETBULK request is received, the subagent must process the request
and send a RESPONSE that sends back as many varBinds as requested by the
request, as long as they fit within the buffers.
<P>
The GETBULK requires similar processing as a GETNEXT with regard to endOfMibView
handling.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A subagent cannot select GETBULK on OS/2.  It will always
be translated into multiple GETNEXT requests.
