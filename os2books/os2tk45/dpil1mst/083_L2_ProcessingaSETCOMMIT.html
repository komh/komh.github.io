<H1>Processing a SET/COMMIT/UNDO Request</H1><!-- entering slot 90 -->
<P>
These three requests can come in one of these sequences:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SET, COMMIT<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SET, UNDO<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SET, COMMIT, UNDO<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The normal sequence is SET and then COMMIT.  When we receive a SET request,
we must make preparations to accept the new value.  For example, check that
it is for an existing object and instance, check the value type and contents
to be valid, allocate memory, but we must not yet make the change.
<P>
If there are no SET errors, the next request we receive will be a COMMIT
request.  It is then that we must make the change, but we must also keep
enough information such that we can UNDO the change later if we get a subsequent
UNDO request.  The latter may happen if the agent discovers any errors with
other subagents while processing requests that belong to the same original
SNMP SET packet.  All the varBinds in the same SNMP request PDU must be
processed "as if atomic".
<P>
When the DPI packet is parsed, the snmp_dpi_hdr structure shows in the<I> packet_type
</I>that this is an SNMP_DPI_SET, SNMP_DPI_COMMIT, or SNMP_DPI_UNDO packet.
 In that case, the packet_body contains a pointer to a SET-varBind, represented
in an snmp_dpi_get_packet structure.  COMMIT and UNDO have same varBind
data as SET upon which they follow:
<PRE>struct dpi_set_packet {  char                   *object_p;   /* ptr to OIDstring     */
  char                   *group_p;    /* ptr to sub-tree      */
  char                   *instance_p; /* ptr to rest of OID   */
  unsigned char           value_type; /* SNMP_TYPE_xxxx       */
  unsigned short          value_len;  /* value length         */
  char                   *value_p;    /* ptr to value itself  */
  struct dpi_set_packet  *next_p;     /* ptr to next in chain */
};
typedef struct dpi_set_packet        snmp_dpi_set_packet;
#define snmp_dpi_set_packet_NULL_p   ((snmp_dpi_set_packet *)0)
</PRE>

<P>
Assuming we have registered example sub-tree dpiSimpleMIB and a GET request
comes in for one variable dpiSimpleString.0 so that is object 1 instance
0 in our sub-tree, and also assuming that the agent knows about our compiled
dpiSimpleMIB so that it knows this is a DisplayString as opposed to just
an arbitrary OCTET_STRING, the pointers in the snmp_dpi_set_packet structure
would have pointers and values like:
<PRE>object_p    -&gt;  "1.3.6.1.4.1.2.2.1.5.2.0"
group_p     -&gt;  "1.3.6.1.4.1.2.2.1.5."
instance_p  -&gt;  "2.0"
value_type  -&gt;  SNMP_TYPE_DisplayString
value_len   -&gt;  8
value_p     -&gt;  pointer to the value to be set
next_p      -&gt;  snmp_dpi_get_packet_NULL_p
</PRE>

<P>
If there are multiple varBinds in a SET request, each one is represented
in a snmp_dpi_set_packet structure and all the snmp_dpi_set_packet structures
are chained via the next pointer.  As long as the next pointer is not the
snmp_dpi_set_packet_NULL_p pointer, there are more varBinds in the list.

<P>
Now we can analyze the varBind structure for whatever checking we want to
do.  Once we are ready to make a response that contains the value of the
variable, we may prepare a new SET-varBind.  However, by definition, the
response to a successful SET is exactly the same as the SET request.  So
there is no need to return any varBinds. A response with SNMP_ERROR_noError
and an index of zero will do.  If there is an error, a response with the
SNMP_ERROR_xxxx error code and an index pointing to the varBind in error
(counting starts at 1) will do.
<P>
The following code example returns a response.  We assume that there are
no errors in the request, but proper code should do the checking for that.
 We also do not check if the varBind in the COMMIT and/or UNDO is the same
as that in the SET request.  A proper agent would make sure that is the
case, but a proper subagent may want to verify that for itself.  We only
do one check that this is dpiSimpleString.0, and if it is not, we return
a noCreation.  This may not be correct, the mainline<!-- entering slot 91 --> does
not even return a response.
