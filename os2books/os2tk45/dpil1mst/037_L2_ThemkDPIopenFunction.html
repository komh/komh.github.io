<B>Syntax</B>
<PRE>#include &lt;snmp_dpi.h&gt;

unsigned char *mkDPIopen(       /* Make a DPI open packet     */
  char          *oid_p,         /* subagent Identifier (OID) */
  char          *description_p, /* subagent descriptive name */
  unsigned long  timeout,       /* requested default timeout  */

<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
oid_p<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A pointer to a NULL terminated character string
representing the OBJECT IDENTIFIER which uniquely identifies the subagent.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>description_p<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A pointer
to a NULL terminated character string, which is a descriptive name for the
subagent.  This can be any DisplayString, which basically is an octet string
containing only characters from the ASCII NVT set.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> timeout
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The requested timeout for this subagent.  An agent
often has a limit for this value and it will use that limit if this value
is larger.  A timeout of zero has a special meaning in the sense that the
agent will use its own default timeout value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> max_varBinds
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The maximum number of varBinds per DPI packet that
the subagent is prepared to handle.  It must be a positive number or zero.
 If a value greater than 1 is specified, the agent will try to combine as
many varBinds which belong to the same sub-tree per DPI packet as possible
up to this value.
<P>
If a value of zero is specified, the agent will try to combine up to as
many varBinds as are present in the SNMP packet and belong to the same sub-tree.
 For example, a value of zero means no limit.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> character_set
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>The character set that you want to use for string-based
data fields in the DPI packets and structures.  The choices are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
DPI_NATIVE_CSET<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Specifies that you want to use the
native character set of the platform on which the agent that you connect
to is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> DPI_ASCII_CSET<!-- lm: 0x2 30 -->
<UL> Specifies
that you want to use the ASCII character set.  The agent will translate
between ASCII and the native character set as required.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> See
<A HREF="063_L1_CharacterSetSelectio.html">Character Set Selection</A> for
more information.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> password_len<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> The
length in octets of an optional password.  It depends on the agent implementation
if a password is needed.  If not, a zero length may be specified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> password_p
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>A pointer to an octet string representing the password
for this subagent.  A password may include any character value, including
the NULL character.  If the password_len is zero, this can be a NULL pointer.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Return Values</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
If successful, a pointer to a static DPI packet buffer is returned.  The
first two bytes of the buffer in network byte order contain the length of
the remaining packet.  The macro DPI_PACKET_LEN can be used to calculate
the total length of the DPI packet.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If failure, a NULL pointer is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The static buffer for the DPI packet is shared by other mkDPIxxxx()
functions that create a serialized DPI packet.
<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
The mkDPIopen() function creates a serialized DPI OPEN packet that can then
be sent to the DPI peer which is a DPI capable SNMP agent.
<P>
Normally you will want to use the native character set, which is the easiest
for the subagent programmer.  However, if the agent and subagent each run
on their own platform and those platforms use different native character
sets, you must select the ASCII character set, so that you both know exactly
how to represent string-based data that is being send back and forth.
<P>
Currently you do not need to specify a password to connect to the OS/2 SNMP
agent.  Therefore, you can pass a length of zero and a NULL pointer for
the password.

<B>Examples</B>
<PRE>  #include &lt;snmp_dpi.h&gt;  unsigned char *pack_p;

  pack_p = mkDPIopen(<!-- entering slot 38 -->"1.3.6.1.2.3.4.5",
                "Sample DPI subagent"
                0L,2L, DPI_NATIVE_CSET, /* max 2 varBinds */
                0,(char *)0);
  if (pack_p) {
     /* send packet to the agent */
  } /* endif */
