<P>
The DPI GET packet holds one or more varBinds that the subagent has taken
responsibility for.
<P>
If the subagent encounters an error while processing the request, it creates
a DPI RESPONSE packet with an appropriate error indication in the error_code
field and sets the error_index to the position of the varBind at which the
error occurs.  The first varBind is index 1, the second varBind is index
2, and so on.  No name, type, length, or value information needs to be provided
in the packet because, by definition, the varBind information is the same
as in the request to which this is a response and the agent still has that
information.
<P>
If there are no errors, the subagent creates a DPI RESPONSE packet in which
the error_code is set to SNMP_ERROR_noError (zero) and error_index is set
to zero.  The packet must also include the name, type, length, and value
of each varBind requested.
<P>
When you get a request for a non-existing object or a non-existing instance
of an object, you must return a NULL value with a type of SNMP_TYPE_noSuchObject
or SNMP_TYPE_noSuchInstance respectively.  These two values are not considered
errors, so the error_code and error_index should be zero.
<P>
The DPI RESPONSE packet is then sent back to the agent.
