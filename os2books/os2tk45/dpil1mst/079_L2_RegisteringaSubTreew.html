<H1>Registering a Sub-Tree with the Agent</H1><!-- entering slot 83 -->
<P>
After we have set up a connection to the agent and after we have identified
ourselves, we must register one or more MIB sub-trees for which we want
to be responsible to handle all SNMP requests.
<P>
To do so, the subagent must create a DPI-REGISTER packet and send it to
the agent.  The agent will then send a response to indicate success or failure
of the register request.
<P>
To create a DPI-REGISTER packet, the subagent uses a call to the mkDPIregister()
function, which expects these parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A timeout value in seconds for this sub-tree.  If
you specify zero, your overall timeout value that was specified in DPI-OPEN
is used.  You can specify a different value if you expect longer processing
time for a specific sub-tree.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A requested priority.  Multiple subagents may register
the same sub-tree at different priorities.  For example, 0 is better than
1 and so on.  The agent considers the subagent with the best priority to
be the active subagent for the sub-tree.  If you specify -1, you are asking
for the best priority available.  If you specify 0, you are asking for a
better priority than any existing subagent may already have.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The MIB sub-tree which you want to control.  You must
specify this parameter with a trailing dot.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Your choice of GETBULK processing.  You can ask the
agent to map a GETBULK into multiple GETNEXT packets or to pass the GETBULK
to you.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The function returns a pointer to a static buffer holding the DPI packet
if successful.  If it fails, it returns a NULL pointer.
<P>
Now we must send this DPI-REGISTER packet to the agent with the DPIsend_packet_to_agent()
function.  This is similar to sending the DPI_OPEN packet.  We then wait
for a response from the agent.  Again, we use the DPIawait_packet_from_agent()
function in the same way as we awaited a response on the DPI-OPEN request.
 Once we have received the response, we must check the return code to ensure
that registration was successful.
<P>
The following code example demonstrates how to register one MIB sub-tree
with the agent.
<PRE>#include &lt;snmp_dpi.h&gt;             /* DPI 2.0 API definitions */static int handle;                /* handle has global scope */

{
   unsigned char *packet_p;
   int            rc;
   unsigned long  length;
   snmp_dpi_hdr  *hdr_p;

   packet_p = mkDPIregister(          /* Make DPI register    */
                3,                    /* timeout in seconds   */
                0,                    /* requested priority   */
                DPI_SIMPLE_MIB,       /* ptr to the sub-tree  */
                DPI_BULK_NO);         /* GetBulk into GetNext */

   if (!packet_p) exit(1);            /* If it failed, exit   */

   rc  = DPIsend_packet_to_agent(     /* send REGISTER packet */
            handle,                   /* on this connection   */
            packet_p,                 /* this is the packet   */
            DPI_PACKET_LEN(packet_p));/* this is its length   */

   if (rc != DPI_RC_OK) exit(1);      /* If it failed, exit   */

   rc  = DPIawait_packet_from_agent(  /* wait for response    */
            handle,                   /* on this connection   */
            3,                        /* timeout in seconds   */
            &amp;packet_p,                /* gets ptr to packet   */
            &amp;length);                 /* gets packet length   */

   if (rc != DPI_RC_OK) exit(1);      /* If it failed, exit   */

   hdr_p = pDPIpacket(packet_p);      /* parse DPI packet     */
   if (hdr_p == snmp_dpi_hdr_NULL_p)  /* Failed to parse it   */
      exit(1);                        /* so exit              */

   if (hdr_p-&gt;packet_type != SNMP_DPI_RESPONSE) exit(1);

   rc = hdr_p-&gt;data_u.resp_p-&gt;error_code;
   if (rc != SNMP_ERROR_DPI_noError) exit(1);
} /* end of do_register() */
