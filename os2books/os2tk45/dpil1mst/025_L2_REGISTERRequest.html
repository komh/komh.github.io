<H1>REGISTER Request</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
Before a subagent will receive any requests for MIB variables, it must first
register the variables or sub-tree it supports with the SNMP agent.  The
subagent must specify a number of parameters in the REGISTER request:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The sub-tree to be registered.  This is a null terminated
string in the selected character set.  The sub-tree must have a trailing
dot.
<P>
For example: "1.3.6.1.2.3.4.5."<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The requested priority for the registration.  The
values are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->Request for the best available priority.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->Request for the next best available priority than
the highest (best) priority currently registered for this sub-tree.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
NNN<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> Any other positive value requests that specific
priority if available or the next worse priority that is available.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
maximum timeout value in seconds.  The agent is requested to wait this long
for a response to any request for an object in this sub-tree.  The agent
may have an absolute maximum timeout value which will be used if the subagents
asks for too large a timeout value.  A value of zero can be used to indicate
that the DPI OPEN value should be used for timeout.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A
specification if the subagent wants to do view selection.  If it does, the
community name from SNMP Version 1 packets will be passed in the DPI GET,
GETNEXT, and SET packets.  This is not supported on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> 
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A specification if the subagent wants to receive
GETBULK packets or if it just prefers that the agent converts a GETBULK
into multiple GETNEXT requests.  This is not supported on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Once a subagent has sent a DPI REGISTER packet to the agent, it should expect
a DPI RESPONSE packet that informs the subagent about the result of the
request.  The packet ID of the RESPONSE packet should be the same as that
of the REGISTER packet to which the RESPONSE packet is the response.
<P>
If the response is successful, the error_index field in the RESPONSE packet
contains the priority that the agent assigned to the sub-tree registration.
 See <A HREF="067_L2_DPIRESPONSEErrorCode.html">DPI RESPONSE Error Codes
</A>for a list of valid codes that may be expected.
<P>
<B>Error Code: higherPriorityRegistered</B>
<P>
The response to a REGISTER request may return the error code "higherPriorityRegistered".
 This may be caused by:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Another subagent already registered the same sub-tree
at a better priority than what you are requesting.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Another subagent already registered a sub-tree at
a higher level (at any priority). For instance, if a registration already
exists for sub-tree 1.2.3.4.5.6 and you try to register for sub-tree 1.2.3.4.5.6.&lt;anything&gt;
then you will get "higherPriorityRegistered" error code.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If you receive this error code, your sub-tree will be registered, but you
will not see any requests for the sub-tree.  They will be passed to the
sub-agent which registered with a better priority.  If you stay connected,
and the other sub-agent goes away, then you will get control over the sub-tree
at that point in time.
