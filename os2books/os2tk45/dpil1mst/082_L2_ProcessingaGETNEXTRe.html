<H1>Processing a GETNEXT Request</H1><!-- entering slot 87 -->
<P>
When a DPI packet is parsed, the snmp_dpi_hdr structure shows in the packet_type
that this is a SNMP_DPI_GETNEXT packet, and so the packet_body contains
a pointer to a GETNEXT-varBind, which is represented in an snmp_dpi_next_packet
structure:
<PRE>struct dpi_next_packet {
  char                   *object_p;    /* ptr to OIDstring    */
  char                   *group_p;     /* ptr to sub-tree     */
  char                   *instance_p;  /* ptr to rest of OID  */
  struct dpi_next_packet *next_p;      /* ptr to next in chain*/
};
typedef struct dpi_next_packet      snmp_dpi_next_packet;
#define snmp_dpi_next_packet_NULL_p ((snmp_dpi_next_packet *)0)
</PRE>

<P>
In the interest of simplicity and easier understanding we will discuss the
GETNEXT for a scalar object, which only has one instance. For columnar objects,
which may have multiple instances, the process is more complex. However,
the DPI subagent programmer should be able to handle that once the basics
of GETNEXT processing in a DPI subagent is understood.
<P>
Assuming we have registered example sub-tree dpiSimpleMIB and a GETNEXT
arrives for one variable, dpiSimpleInteger.0, so that is object 1 instance
0 in our sub-tree, the fields in the snmp_dpi_get_packet structure would
have pointers to:
<PRE>object_p    -&gt;  "1.3.6.1.4.1.2.2.1.5.1.0"
group_p     -&gt;  "1.3.6.1.4.1.2.2.1.5."
instance_p  -&gt;  "1.0"
next_p      -&gt;  snmp_dpi_next_packet_NULL_p
</PRE>

<P>
If there are multiple varBinds in a GETNEXT request, each one is represented
in a snmp_dpi_get_packet structure and all the snmp_dpi_get_packet structures
are chained via the next pointer.  As long as the next pointer is not the
snmp_dpi_next_packet_NULL_p pointer, there are more varBinds in the list.

<P>
Now we can analyze the varBind structure for whatever checking we want to
do.  We must find out which OID is the one that lexicographically follows
the one in the request.  It is that OID with its value that we must return
as a response.  Therefore, we must now also set the proper OID in the response.
 Once we are ready to make a response that contains the new OID and the
value of that variable, we must prepare a SET-varBind which is represented
in an snmp_dpi_set_packet:
<PRE>struct dpi_set_packet {
  char                   *object_p;   /* ptr to OIDstring     */
  char                   *group_p;    /* ptr to sub-tree      */
  char                   *instance_p; /* ptr to rest of OID   */
  unsigned char           value_type; /* SNMP_TYPE_xxxx       */
  unsigned short          value_len;  /* value length         */
  char                   *value_p;    /* ptr to value itself  */
  struct dpi_set_packet  *next_p;     /* ptr to next in chain */
};
typedef struct dpi_set_packet        snmp_dpi_set_packet;
#define snmp_dpi_set_packet_NULL_p   ((snmp_dpi_set_packet *)0)
</PRE>

<P>
We can use the mkDPIset() function to prepare such a structure. This function
expects the following parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to an existing snmp_dpi_set_packet structure
if the new varBind must be added to an existing chain of varBinds.  If this
is the first or only varBind in the chain, we pass the snmp_dpi_set_packet_NULL_p
pointer to indicate this.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to the sub-tree that we registered.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to the rest of the OID, in other words the
piece that follows the sub-tree.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The value type of the value to be bound to the variable
name.  This is must be one of the SNMP_TYPE_xxxx values as defined in the
snmp_dpi.h include file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The length of the value for integer type values.  This
must be a length of 4.  So we always work with 32-bit signed or unsigned
integers except for the Counter64 type.  For Counter 64 type, we must point
to a snmp_dpi_u64 structure and pass the length of that structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to the value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Memory for the varBind is dynamically allocated and the data itself is copied.
 Upon return, we can dispose of our own pointers and allocated memory as
we please.  If the call is successful, a pointer is returned as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A new snmp_dpi_set_packet if it is the first or only
varBind.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The existing snmp_dpi_set_packet that we passed on
the call.  In this case, the new packed has been chained to the end of the
varBind list.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the mkDPIset() call fails, a NULL pointer is returned.
<P>
Once we have prepared the SET-varBind data, we can create a DPI RESPONSE
packet using the mkDPIresponse() function, which expects these parameters:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to an snmp_dpi_hdr.  We should use the<!-- entering slot 88 --> header
of the parsed incoming packet.  It is used to copy the packet_id from the
request into the response, such that the agent can correlate the response
to a request.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A return code which is an SNMP error code.  If successful,
this should be SNMP_ERROR_noError (value zero).  If failure, it must be
one of the SNMP_ERROR_xxxx values as defined in the snmp_dpi.h include file.

<P>
A request for a non-existing object or instance is not considered an error.
 Instead, we must pass the OID and value of the first OID that lexicographically
follows the non-existing object and/or instance.
<P>
Reaching the end of our sub-tree is not considered an error.  For example,
if there is no NEXT OID, this is not an error.  In this situation we must
return the original OID as received in the request and a value_type of SNMP_TYPE_endOfMibView.
 This value_type has an implicit value of NULL, so we can pass a zero length
and a NULL pointer for the value.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The index of the first varBind in error starts counting
at 1.  Pass zero if no error occurred, or pass the proper index of the first
varBind for which an error was detected.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to a chain of snmp_dpi_set_packet(s) (varBinds)
to be returned as response to the GETNEXT request.  If an error was detected,
an snmp_dpi_set_packet_NULL_p pointer may be passed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following code example returns a response.  We assume that there are
no errors in the request, but proper code should do the checking for that.
 We do proper checking for lexicographic next object, but we do no checking
for ULONG_MAX, or making sure that the instance ID is indeed valid (digits
and dots).  If we get to the end of our dpiSimpleMIB, we must return an
endOfMibView as defined by the SNMP Version 2 rules.
