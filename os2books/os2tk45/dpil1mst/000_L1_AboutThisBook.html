<P>
This book is designed as a programmer's guide for the IBM SystemView Agent
Version 1.4 program (hereafter referred to as SystemView Agent). The SystemView
Agent provides the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent distributed
protocol interface (DPI). The SNMP DPI permits users to dynamically add,
delete, or replace management variables in the local Management Information
Base (MIB) without requiring you to recompile the SNMP agent.
