<P>
<B>Parameters</B><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
timeout<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> The requested timeout in seconds.  An agent
often has a limit for this value and it will use that limit if this value
is larger.  The value zero has special meaning in the sense that it tells
the agent to use the timeout value that was specified in the DPI OPEN packet.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>priority<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> The requested priority.
 This field may contain any of these values:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->Requests the best available priority.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->Requests a better priority than the highest priority
currently registered.  Use this value to obtain the SNMP DPI Version 1 behavior.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
nnn<!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> Any positive value.  You will receive that priority
if available, otherwise the next best priority that is available.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> group_p
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>A pointer to a NULL terminated character string
that represents the sub-tree to be registered.  This group ID must have
a trailing dot.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> bulk_select<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> Specifies
if you want the agent to pass GETBULK on to the subagent or to map them
into multiple GETNEXT requests.  The choices are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
DPI_BULK_NO<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL> Do not pass any GETBULK requests, but
instead map a GETBULK request into multiple GETNEXT requests.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> DPI_BULK_YES
<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL>Do pass a GETBULK request to the subagent.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Return Values</B><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
If successful, a pointer to a static DPI packet buffer is returned.  The
first two bytes of the buffer in network byte order contain the length of
the remaining packet.  The macro DPI_PACKET_LEN can be used to calculate
the total length of the DPI packet.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
If failure, a NULL pointer is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The static buffer for the DPI packet is shared by other mkDPIxxxx()
functions that create a serialized DPI packet.
<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
The mkDPIregister() function creates a serialized DPI REGISTER packet that
can then be sent to the DPI peer which is a DPI capable SNMP agent.
<P>
The<I> bulk_select</I> can be used to ask the agent to map an SNMP GETBULK
request into multiple GETNEXT requests.  This makes it easier for the DPI
subagent programmer because GETBULK processing doesn't need implementing.

<P>
However, if one expects that a single GETBULK might improve the performance
a lot, one can tell the agent to pass such requests.  This might be the
case if one expects a GETBULK to arrive often for a table for which one
needs to do a kernel dive.  Using GETBULK, one might be able to do just
one dive instead of many.  Although one could anticipate the dive with a
GETNEXT also, and therefore obtain and cache the table upon the first GETNEXT
request.
<P>
According to the DPI 2.0 RFC, not all agents need to support DPI_BULK_YES.
These agents will return an appropriate error code in the DPI RESPONSE though
if such is the case.
<P>
<!-- entering slot 40 -->Normally the SNMP agent sends a DPI RESPONSE packet
back.  This packet identifies if the register was successful or not.
<P>
<B>Examples</B>
<PRE>  #include &lt;snmp_dpi.h&gt;  unsigned char *pack_p;

  pack_p = mkDPIregister(0,0L,"1.3.6.1.2.3.4.5."
                         DPI_BULK_NO);
  if (pack_p) {
     /* send packet to agent and await response */
  } /* endif */
