<H1>SNMP DPI API Version 2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 10 -->
<P>
By default, when you include the snmp_dpi.h include file, you will be exposed
to the DPI 2.0 API.  For a list of the functions provided, see <A HREF="073_L2_Thesnmp_dpihIncludeF.html">The
snmp_dpi.h Include File</A>. This is the recommended use of the SNMP DPI
API.  When you link-edit your object code into an executable file, you must
use the new DPI functions as provided in the DPI20DLL.LIB and DPI20DLL.DLL
files.
<P>
Waiting for a DPI packet also depends on the platform and how the chosen
transport protocol is exactly implemented.  In addition, some subagents
want to control sending of and waiting for packets themselves, because they
may need to be driven by other interrupts as well.
<P>
There is a set of DPI transport-related functions that are implemented on
all platforms to hide the platform dependent issues for those subagents
that do not need detailed control about the transport themselves.
