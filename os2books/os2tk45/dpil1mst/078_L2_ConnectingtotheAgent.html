<H1>Connecting to the Agent</H1><!-- entering slot 81 -->
<P>
Before a subagent can receive or send any DPI packets from/to the SNMP DPI
capable agent, it must "connect" to the agent and identify itself to the
agent.
<P>
The following example code returns a response.  We assume that there are
no errors in the request, but proper code should do the checking for that.
 We do proper checking for lexicographic next object, but we do no checking
for ULONG_MAX, or making sure that the instance ID is indeed valid (digits
and dots).  If we get to the end of our dpiSimpleMIB, we must return an
endOfMibView as defined by the SNMP Version 2 rules.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A host name or IP address in dot notation that specifies
where the agent is running.  Often the name "loopback" or "localhost" can
be used if the subagent runs on the same system as the agent.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A community name which is used to obtain the DPI TCP
port from the agent.  Internally that is done by sending a regular SNMP
GET request to the agent.  In an open environment, we probably can use the
well know community name "public".<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The function returns a negative error code if an error occurs.  If the connection
setup is successful, it returns a handle which represents the connection
and which we must use on subsequent calls to send or await DPI packets.

<P>
The second step is to identify the subagent to the agent.  This is done
by making a DPI-OPEN packet, sending it to the agent, and then awaiting
the response from the agent.  The agent may accept or deny the OPEN request.
 Making a DPI-OPEN packet is done by calling mkDPIopen() which expects the
following parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A unique subagent identification (an Object Identifier).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A description which can be the NULL string ("").<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Overall subagent timeout in seconds.  The agent uses
this value as a timeout value for a response when it sends a request to
the subagent.  The agent may have a maximum value for this timeout that
will be used if you exceed it.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The maximum number of varBinds per DPI packet that
the subagent is willing or is able to handle.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The character set we want to use.  In most cases you
want to use the native character set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Length of a password.  A zero means no password.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Pointer to the password or NULL if no password.  It
depends on the agent if subagents must specify a password to open up a connection.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The function returns a pointer to a static buffer holding the DPI packet
if successful.  If it fails, it returns a NULL pointer.
<P>
Once the DPI-OPEN packet has been created, you must send it to the agent.
 You can use the DPIsend_packet_to_agent() function which expects the following
parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The handle of a connection from DPIconnect_to_agent_TCP.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to the DPI packet from mkDPIopen.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The length of the packet.  The snmp_dpi.h include
file provides a macro DPI_PACKET_LEN that calculates the packet length of
a DPI packet.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This function returns DPI_RC_OK (value zero) if successful. Otherwise, an
appropriate DPI_RC_xxxx error code as defined in snmp_dpi.h is returned.

<P>
Now we must wait for a response to the DPI-OPEN.  To await such a response,
you call the DPIawait_packet_from_agent() function which expects the following
parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The handle of a connection from DPIconnect_to_agent_TCP.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A timeout in seconds, which is the maximum time to
wait for response.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to a pointer, which will receive a pointer
to a static buffer containing the awaited DPI packet.  If the system fails
to receive a packet, a NULL pointer is stored.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pointer to a long integer (32-bit), which will receive
the length of the awaited packet.  If it fails, it will be set to zero.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This function returns DPI_RC_OK (value zero) if successful. Otherwise, an
appropriate DPI_RC_xxxx error code as defined in snmp_dpi.h is returned.

<P>
The last step is to ensure that we received a DPI-RESPONSE back from the
agent.  If we did, then we must ensure that the agent accepted us as a valid
subagent.  This will be shown by the error_code field in the DPI response
packet.
<P>
The following example code establishes a connection and "opens" it by identifying
<!-- entering slot 82 -->yourself to the agent.
