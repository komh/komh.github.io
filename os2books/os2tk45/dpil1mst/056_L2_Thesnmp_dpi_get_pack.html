object_p<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A pointer to a NULL terminated character
string that represents the full OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the variable instance
that is being accessed.  It basically is a concatenation of the fields<I> group_p
</I>and<I> instance_p</I>.  Using this field is not recommended because
it is only included for DPI Version 1 compatibility and it maybe withdrawn
in a later version.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> group_p<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A
pointer to a NULL terminated character string that represents the registered
sub-tree that caused this GET request to be passed to this DPI subagent.
 The sub-tree must have a trailing dot.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> instance_p
<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>A pointer to a NULL terminated character string
that represents the rest which is the piece following the sub-tree part
of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the variable instance being accessed.
<P>
Use of the term<I> instance_p</I> here should not be confused with an OBJECT
instance because this string may consist of a piece of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
plus the INSTANCE IDENTIFIER.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> next_p<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> A
pointer to a possible next snmp_dpi_get_packet structure.  If this next
field contains the NULL pointer, this is the end of the chain.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Description</B>
<P>
The snmp_dpi_get_packet structure represents a parse tree for a DPI GET
packet.
<P>
At the subagent side, the snmp_dpi_get_packet structure is normally created
as a result of a call to pDPIpacket().  This is the case if the DPI packet
is of type SNMP_DPI_GET.  The snmp_dpi_hdr structure then contains a pointer
to a chain of one or more snmp_dpi_get_packet structures.
<P>
The DPI subagent programmer uses this structure to find out which variables
instances are to be returned in a DPI RESPONSE.
