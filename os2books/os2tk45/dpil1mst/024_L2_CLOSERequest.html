<P>
When a subagent is finished and wants to end processing, it should first
UNREGISTER its sub-trees and then close the "connection" with the agent.
 To do so, it must send a DPI CLOSE packet, which specifies a reason for
the closing.  See <A HREF="065_L2_DPICLOSEReasonCodes.html">DPI CLOSE Reason
Codes</A> for a list of valid codes.  You should not expect a response to
the CLOSE request.
<P>
A subagent should also be prepared to handle an incoming DPI CLOSE packet
from the agent.  In this case, the packet will contain a reason code for
the CLOSE request.  A subagent does not have to send a response to a CLOSE
request.  The agent just assumes that the subagent will handle it appropriately.
 The close takes place regardless of what the subagent does with it.
