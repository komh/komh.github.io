<H1>Multithreading Programming Considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
The DPI Version 2.0 DLL for OS/2 (DPI20DLL.DLL file) has been compiled with
the /Gm+ compiler flag.  This enables it to be used by both single and multithreaded
subagents.  However, even a single threaded subagent must be compiled with
the /Gm+ compiler flag.
<P>
There are several static buffers in the DPI code.  For compatibility reasons,
that cannot be changed.  Real multithread support will probably mean several
potentially incompatible changes to the DPI 2.0 API.
<P>
<B>Use a Locking Mechanism</B>
<P>
If your subagent will be a multithreaded process, then you must always use
some locking mechanism of your own around the use of the static buffers.
 Otherwise, one thread maybe writing into the static buffer while another
is writing into the same buffer at the same time. There are two static buffers.
 One buffer is for building the serialized DPI packet before sending it
out and the other buffer is for receiving incoming DPI packets.
<P>
Basically, all DPI functions that return a pointer to an unsigned char are
the DPI functions that write into the static buffer to create a serialized
DPI packet:
<PRE>mkDPIAreYouThere()
mkDPIopen()
mkDPIregister()
mkDPIunregister()
mkDPItrap()
mkDPIresponse()
mkDPIpacket()
mkDPIclose ()
</PRE>

<P>
After you have called the DPIsend_packet_to_agent() function for the buffer,
which is pointed to by the pointer returned by one of the above functions,
it is free to use again.
<P>
There is one function that reads the static input buffer:
<PRE>pDPIpacket()
</PRE>

<P>
The input buffer gets filled by the DPIawait_packet_from_agent() function.
 You get a pointer to the static input buffer upon return from the await.
 The pDPIpacket() function parses the static input buffer and returns a
pointer to dynamically allocated memory. Therefore, after the pDPIparse()
call, the buffer is available for use again.
<P>
The current situation is such that if multiple threads are waiting at the
same time and for different handles, there is the risk that two incoming
DPI packets will overlay each other.
<P>
If multiple threads are waiting for the same handle, when data arrives both
threads come out of the wait.  If one of them issues another wait before
the other one is finished parsing the input buffer, the buffer may get overlaid
by a new packet before the second one gets a chance to parse the packet.

<P>
The DPI internal handle structures and control blocks used by the underlying
code to send and receive data to and from the agent are also static data
areas.  You must make sure that you use your own locking mechanism around
the functions that add, change, or delete data in those static structures.
 The functions that change those internal static structures are:
<PRE>DPIconnect_to_agentTCP()
DPIconnect_to_agentSHM()
DPIconnect_to_agentUDP()
DPIdisconnect_from_agent()
</PRE>

<P>
The other functions that access those static structures which must be assured
that the structure is not being changed while they are referencing it during
their execution are:
<PRE>DPIawait_packet_from_agent()
DPIsend_packet_to_agent()
DPIget_fd_for_handle()
</PRE>

<P>
While the last 3 functions can be executed concurrently in different threads,
you must ensure that no other thread is adding or deleting handles during
this process.
