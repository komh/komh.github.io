<P>
A DPI SET packet contains the name, type, length, and value of each varBind
requested, plus the value type, value length, and value to be set.
<P>
If the subagent encounters an error while processing the request, it creates
a DPI RESPONSE packet with an appropriate error indication in the error_code
field and an error_index listing the position of the varBind at which the
error occurs.  The first varBind is index 1, the second varBind is index
2, and so on.  No name, type, length, or value information needs to provided
in the packet because, by definition, the varBind information is the same
as in the request to which this is a response and the agent still has that
information.
<P>
If there are no errors, the subagent creates a DPI RESPONSE packet in which
the error_code is set to SNMP_ERROR_noError (zero) and error_index is set
to zero.  No name, type, length, or value information is needed because
the RESPONSE to a SET should contain exactly the same varBind data as the
data present in the request.  The agent can use the values it already has.

<P>
This suggests that the agent must keep state information, and that is the
case.  It needs to do that anyway in order to be able to later pass the
data with a DPI COMMIT or DPI UNDO packet.  Since there are no errors, the
subagent must have allocated the required resources and prepared itself
for the SET.  It does not yet carry out the set, that will be done at COMMIT
time.
<P>
The subagent sends a DPI RESPONSE packet, indicating success or failure
for the preparation phase, back to the agent.  The agent will issue a SET
request for all other varBinds in the same original SNMP request it received.
 This may be to the same subagent or to one or more different subagents.

<P>
Once all SET requests have returned a "no error" condition, the agent starts
sending DPI COMMIT packets to the subagent(s).  If any SET request returns
an error, the agent sends DPI UNDO packets to those subagents that indicated
successful processing of the SET preparation phase.
<P>
When the subagent receives the DPI COMMIT packet, all the varBind information
will again be available in the packet.  The subagent can now carry out the
SET request.
<P>
If the subagent encounters an error while processing the COMMIT request,
it creates a DPI RESPONSE packet with value SNMP_ERROR_commitFailed in the
error_code field and an error_index that lists at which varBind the error
occurs.  The first varBind is index 1, and so on.  No name, type, length,
or value information is needed.  The fact that a commitFailed error exists
does not mean that this error should be returned easily.  A subagent should
do all that is possible to make a COMMIT succeed.
<P>
If there are no errors and the SET and COMMIT have been carried out with
success, the subagent creates a DPI RESPONSE packet in which the error_code
is set to SNMP_ERROR_noError (zero) and error_index is set to zero.  No
name, type, length, or value information is needed.
<P>
So far we have discussed a successful SET and COMMIT sequence. However,
after a successful SET, the subagent may receive a DPI UNDO packet.  The
subagent must now undo any preparations it made during the SET processing,
such as free allocated memory.
<P>
Even after a COMMIT, a subagent may still receive a DPI UNDO packet.  This
will occur if some other subagent could not complete a COMMIT request.  Because
of the SNMP requirement that all varBinds in a single SNMP SET request must
be changed "as if simultaneous", all committed changes must be undone if
any of the COMMIT requests fail. In this case the subagent must try and
undo the committed SET operation.
<P>
If the subagent encounters an error while processing the UNDO request, it
creates a DPI RESPONSE packet with value SNMP_ERROR_undoFailed in the error_code
field and an error_index that lists at which varBind the error occurs.  The
first varBind is index 1, and so on.  No name, type, length, or value information
is needed.  The fact that an undoFailed error exists does not mean that
this error should be returned easily.  A subagent should do all that is
possible to make an UNDO succeed.
<P>
If there are no errors and the UNDO has been successful, the subagent creates
a DPI RESPONSE packet in which the error_code is set to SNMP_ERROR_noError
(zero) and error_index is set to zero.  No name, type, length, or value
information is needed.
