<H1>Querying the Available Colors</H1><!-- entering slot 1186 -->
<P>
Several query functions are provided for applications to get information
about the current logical and physical color tables before defining a logical
color table.
<P>
Applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D CE C3 35 --> GpiQueryColorData
</A>to determine whether the default logical color table is in effect. If
it is not, the following information about the loaded logical color table
is returned:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Format of the current logical color table<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Smallest and largest color indexes (if the table is
in index mode) supported in this color table. The smallest color index is
always 0, and the largest color index is never less than 15, because deleting
entries from the default logical color table is not permitted.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 03 C4 39 -->GpiQueryRealColors</A> returns the
RGB values of each of the distinct colors defined in the physical color
table of the current device. It also can return the index in the current
logical color table that references each of the colors in the physical table.

<P>
To determine the available colors nearest to a specified color on a particular
device, call<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 FC --> GpiQueryNearestColor</A>,
which accepts as input the RGB value of the desired color. The function
returns the RGB value of the nearest available color in the physical color
table of the associated device.
<P>
Applications can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 06 C4 3A --> GpiQueryRGBColor
</A>to determine the RGB value of a particular color.<A><!-- external link: 1D 06 C4 3A --> GpiQueryRGBColor
</A>accepts as input the index to the logical color table entry of the color
in question. Output from this function is the RGB value that the index would
reference in the physical color table. If a logical color table is loaded
in RGB mode,<A><!-- external link: 1D 06 C4 3A --> GpiQueryRGBColor</A> returns
the same results as<A><!-- external link: 1D F7 C3 FC --> GpiQueryNearestColor</A>.

<P>
Conversely, to determine the index value that references a given RGB color
(or the closest match to that color) in the physical color table, an application
uses<A><!-- external link: 1D CF C3 FC --> GpiQueryColorIndex</A>. The application
can determine which colors are in the current logical color table by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D EE C3 FC -->GpiQueryLogColorTable</A>. To determine
which colors are in the physical color table, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 03 C4 FC --> GpiQueryRealColors</A>.
