<P>
The names of the graphics-order codes are in the form OCODE_Gxxx. The Gxxx
abbreviation is the name of the individual order, and can be used for types,
structures, and constants directly related to that order. In the header
file, there is a comment on the same line as each of the orders that describes
the order. For example, the Begin Area order (GBAR) is described in the
header file as follows:
<PRE>#define OCODE_GBAR     0x68  /* Begin area    */
#define GBAR_BOUNDARY  0xC0
</PRE>

In some structures, an S or an L is added to the name to differentiate between
the short-coordinate form (16-bit) and the long-coordinate form (32-bit).
For example, the Set Arc Parameters order (GSAP) is as follows:
<PRE>#define OCODE_GSAP     0x22
#define OCODE_GPSAP    0x62

   typedef struct _ORDERS_GSAP {
     SHORT  p;
     SHORT  q;
     SHORT  r;
     SHORT  s;
   } ORDERS_GSAP;

   typedef struct _ORDERL_GSAP {
     LONG   p;
     LONG   q;
     LONG   r;
     LONG   s;
   } ORDERL_GSAP;
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the structures ORDERS_GSAP and ORDERL_GSAP are shared by
GSAP (set arc parameters) and GPSAP (push and set arc parameters). As a
rule, there is structure sharing between the set and push-and-set forms
of graphics orders.
<P>
There is structure-sharing between the current-position and the given-position
forms of some orders. For example, the orders GCARC (arc at current position)
and GARC (arc at given position) share a structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
