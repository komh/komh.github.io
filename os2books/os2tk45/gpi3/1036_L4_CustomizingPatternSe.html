<H1>Customizing Pattern Sets</H1><!-- entering slot 1055 -->
<P>
An application can create custom patterns by using bit maps or characters
and symbols from an image font. When designing custom patterns, consider
that the operating system uses only the first eight bits in the first eight
rows, starting with the lower-left corner of the bit map. The cell size
of an image font used as a fill pattern might be too large to include the
complete character or symbol.
<P>
An application can change the appearance of a fill pattern by changing its
alignment in an area primitive with<A><!-- external link: 1D 4E C4 FC --> GpiSetPatternRefPoint</A>.
When the default reference point is set, the operating system aligns the
lower-left corner of the fill pattern with the point (0,0) in the application's
world space and begins filling the area. If an application adjusts the pattern
reference point to (3,2), The operating system aligns the lower-left corner
of the fill pattern with the point (3,2) in the application's world space
and begins filling the area. By moving the reference point from (0,0) to
(3,2), the fill pattern appears shifted up two pels and to the right three
pels.
