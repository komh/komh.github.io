<P>
The priority of a segment, in conjunction with the current foreground and
background mix attributes, affects how the picture is presented to the user.
The segment with the highest priority is drawn last, and appears on top
of the previously drawn primitives. Picture components in segments with
low priorities risk being drawn over and never seen by the user. The mix
attributes affect the graphics functions within each segment.
