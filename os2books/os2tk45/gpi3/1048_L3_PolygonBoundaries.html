<H1>Polygon Boundaries</H1><!-- entering slot 1068 -->
<P>
Applications have two options when specifying the polygon boundary:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_BOUNDARY (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_NOBOUNDARY.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The POLYGON_BOUNDARY value tells the PM programming interface to draw all
outlines of the polygon primitives using a line that conforms to the current
<A HREF="284_L2_LINEBUNDLE.html">LINEBUNDLE</A> attributes. If the line
attributes have not been changed, the default outline color is black on
most display devices and printers, and the default line style is solid.
As the attributes cannot be changed within the context of<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 FC --> GpiPolygons</A>,
all polygons are drawn with the same line. The interior of the polygons
are filled with the pattern that conforms to the current <A HREF="006_L2_AREABUNDLE.html">AREABUNDLE
</A>attributes.
<P>
To prevent PM from outlining an area, an application can use the POLYGON_NOBOUNDARY
flag when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 FC --> GpiPolygons</A>.
Only the interior fill pattern is visible. This value is used most often
when there are many overlapping polygons, and the interior lines are not
desired.
<P>
You might think of this option in terms similar to the outline and fill
options discussed with boxes and full arcs. The POLYGON_BOUNDARY value corresponds
to the DRO_OUTLINEFILL value, and POLYGON_NOBOUNDARY, to the DRO_FILL. There
is no distinct boundary value that corresponds to DRO_OUTLINE, the simple
outline.
<P>
To simulate this effect, OR the POLYGON_NOBOUNDARY value with the appropriate
polygon construction value, described below, when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 FC --> GpiPolygons</A>.
