<P>
Some applications let you prepare output in multiple stages. For example,
a word processing application might permit you to prepare your text first
and then add bit maps that enhance and support the text. These applications
can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 2D --> GpiExcludeClipRectangle</A> to
exclude an area from a clip region, preventing the user from deleting output
that already exists.
<P>
To exclude an area from a clip region, first determine the dimensions (in
device coordinates) of the smallest rectangle that completely surrounds
the area to exclude from the clip region. Then call<A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 FC --> GpiExcludeClipRectangle</A>,
including as input the dimensions of the area to exclude. The following
figure illustrates these steps.
<PRE>#include &lt;os2.h&gt;
void fncCLIP03(void){
    HPS   hps;
    RECTL rcl;
        .
        .  /* Set rectangle coordinates here. */
        .
    GpiExcludeClipRectangle(hps, &amp;rcl);
} /* fncCLIP03 */
