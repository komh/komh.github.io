<H1>OR Mix Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 1197 -->
<P>
When using FM_OR, the foreground of the new primitive is merged with the
existing drawing at the points of overlap. This is effected by ORing the
indexes of the overlapping colors to produce a third color. The resulting
color is unpredictable if the logical color table has not been realized
(using the palette manager). The OR mix attribute is useful for making the
common points of two graphics distinct from the points belonging to one
of the graphics only, as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1175_L4_ORMixAttribute_48.gif" WIDTH=513 HEIGHT=370>

OR Mix Attribute
<P>
The circle is drawn on top of the square. At the points of overlap, indexes
are OR'd to produce a new index referencing a new RGB color in the physical
color table.

<P>
When using the BM_OR attribute, the background of the primitive is merged
with the existing drawing according to the same rules that apply to the
FM_OR attribute.
