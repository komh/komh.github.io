<P>
WinDrawBitmap draws a bit-map image by copying it into a window linked to
a target presentation space. A call to this function is valid only in draw
mode (DM_DRAW), and only for a screen device context. This function does
not require an application to select a bit map into a presentation space
before the application draws the corresponding image. An application can
use WinDrawBitmap to scale bit maps by specifying DBM_STRETCH as the last
argument, and the address of a RECTL structure as the fourth argument. The
coordinates in this structure are always device coordinates.
<P>
WinDrawBitmap draws both color and monochrome bit maps. Color bit maps require
no color conversion. Monochrome bit maps can be drawn in any two colors
which can be explicitly specified as parameters to the call or taken from
the image bundle. These parameters will be color table indexes or RGB values,
depending on the color table mode of the target presentation space. The
current image bundle mix modes are used and, for certain mix values, will
affect color.
<P>
You can call WinDrawBitmap in retain mode, but the bit-map image will only
be drawn and not recorded in the segments.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> An application can determine the current colors and their
corresponding mix modes by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C3 FC --> GpiQueryAttrs</A>.
The application can set them by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 FC --> GpiSetAttrs</A>.

<P>
An<I> inverted</I> bit map is a bit map in which the colors have been inverted;
white becomes black and black becomes white. An application can draw inverted
bit maps by calling WinDrawBitmap and passing it DBM_INVERT as the last
argument. An application can draw halftone bit maps by calling WinDrawBitmap
and passing it DBM_HALFTONE as the last argument. Before drawing the bit
map, clear the presentation space to CLR_BACKGROUND using<A><!-- external link: 1D 8E C3 FC --> GpiErase</A>.
