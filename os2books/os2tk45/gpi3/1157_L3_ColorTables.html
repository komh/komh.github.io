<P>
A color table is an array of RGB values. There are two kinds of color tables:
 logical and physical. The logical color table is a list of colors specific
to a presentation space. An application typically uses a logical color table
to define colors specific to that application.
<P>
The physical color table specifies colors the device can generate currently.
These device colors are shared by every application on the system. Because
some display adapters cannot generate every possible device color at the
same time, the physical color table can be a subset of the full range of
possible device colors. The operating system maps the RGB values specified
in the logical color table to device colors in the physical color table.
