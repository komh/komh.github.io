<H1>About Boundary Determination</H1><!-- entering slot 1167 -->
<P>
<I>Boundary determination</I> is an operation to compute the size of the
smallest rectangle that encloses a graphics output in model space. One use
of boundary determination is to enable you to repair only the affected parts
of the screen, when a graphics object is moved, for example, or when a graphics
object is changed some other way. Dynamic segments are not included in boundary-determination
operations.
<P>
Boundary determination can be performed on both retained and nonretained
graphics. In both instances, you request boundary data to be calculated
by setting the<I> boundary data flag</I> (DCTL_BOUNDARY) in<A><!-- external link: 1D 39 C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawControl</A>.
If you do not set this flag (for example, if you do not want to collect
boundary data unnecessarily) and later find that you need boundary data
for a particular object, you can do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Switch on the boundary-data flag, and switch
off the display flag, using<A><!-- external link: 1D 39 C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawControl</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Redraw the object in its current location. Boundary
data is collected, but the object is unaltered.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If you are drawing retained graphics, each drawing request (<A><!-- external link: 1D 88 C3 47 -->GpiDrawSegment</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 87 C3 FC -->GpiDrawFrom</A>, and<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 FC --> GpiDrawChain</A>)
causes the boundary data resulting from the drawing to be made available.
The application must request this data explicitly by calling GpiQueryDeviceBitmapFormats
after each drawing request for which it wants to examine boundary data.
Boundary data is returned to the application in model space coordinates.
The boundary data is reset before each retained drawing operation, so there
is no risk of accumulating data from separate operations.
<P>
If you are drawing nonretained graphics, boundary data is accumulated for
each<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 48 --> GpiPutData</A> and for each individual
primitive drawing function. The application can request the accumulated
boundary data at any time by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D C0 C3 FC --> GpiQueryBoundaryData</A>.
Data continues to accumulate unless you call the<A><!-- external link: 1D 16 C4 FC --> GpiResetBoundaryData</A>;
it is not reset automatically.
<P>
The boundary data returned to you is in the form of four model-space coordinates,
which are the lowest (x,y) positions and the highest (x,y) positions of
the bounding rectangle in model space as illustrated in the following figure.
