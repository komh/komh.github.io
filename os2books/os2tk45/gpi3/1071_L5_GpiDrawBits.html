<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 1B -->GpiDrawBits</A> copies bit map image
data from storage into a bit map that has been selected into a device context
associated with a presentation space. It can also copy bit-map image data
to a device. An application can use this function to draw a bit map without
first selecting the bit map into a presentation space.
<P>
This function is valid in all draw modes. Set the draw mode to DM_RETAIN
or DM_DRAWANDRETAIN to create retained segments; otherwise, the default
mode, DM_DRAW, is selected.
