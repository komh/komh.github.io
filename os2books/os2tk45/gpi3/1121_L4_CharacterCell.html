<H1>Character Cell</H1><!-- entering slot 1142 -->
<P>
A<I> character cell</I> is an imaginary rectangular boundary that defines
the horizontal and vertical space occupied by a single character from an
outline character set.
<P>
The PM calculates character cell width and height from the point size. The
width value for the character cell is the nominal width of the lowercase
characters in the character set. In a<I> monospace</I> font, the width of
all character cells is identical. In a<I> proportional</I> font, the width
of the character cells depends on the character.
<P>
In an image font, the height of the character cell is the number of pels
in the font. In an outline font, the height of the character cell is the
point size of the font.
<P>
The characters in a character string are positioned one character per cell.
The spacing between adjacent characters in a string is affected by the character
cell attribute, except for image characters in CM_MODE1.
<P>
<I>Cell width</I> determines the spacing of consecutive characters along
the baseline, as illustrated in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1121_L4_CharacterCell_18.gif" WIDTH=603 HEIGHT=449>

Character Cell Measurements
<P>

<P>
Current cell size is specified using<A><!-- external link: 1D 28 C4 FC --> GpiSetCharBox</A>.
As input, this function accepts the desired height and width of the character
cell in world coordinates. These values are related to certain dimensions
in the FONTMETRICS structure that controls font attributes. Heights or widths
of 0 are valid input and cause the outline character to be drawn as a point
or straight line. Heights or widths of negative values cause certain special
effects, for example, reversed lettering.
<P>
The character cell value affects both the size and position of characters
drawn from an outline font, regardless of the current character mode. Each
character is scaled up or down to fit the cell size, as shown in the following
figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1121_L4_CharacterCell_19.gif" WIDTH=617 HEIGHT=560>

Effect of the Character Cell on an Outline Font
<P>

<P>
The character cell value is ignored if the current font is an image font
and the current character mode is CM_MODE1, as shown in the following figure.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> It is essential to code the character cell correctly, even
if you anticipate using image fonts. In case of a font match failure, an
outline font can be substituted for a image font.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1121_L4_CharacterCell_20.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>
<P>
Effect of the Character Cell on an Image Font in CM_MODE1
<P>
Although the character cell has been both increased and decreased, the character
string is unaltered.
<P>

<P>
The character cell value controls the<I> positioning</I> of image-font characters
when the current character mode is CM_MODE2; but it cannot cause the characters
to be scaled to fit the cell. This effect is shown in the following figure.
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1121_L4_CharacterCell_21.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>
<P>
Effect of the Character Cell on an Image Font in CM_MODE2
<P>
If you increase the character cell size for an image font in CM_MODE2, the
characters are more widely spaced, but their size is not changed. If you
decrease character cell size, the space between the characters is reduced,
and because the characters themselves cannot be scaled, they can overlap.
