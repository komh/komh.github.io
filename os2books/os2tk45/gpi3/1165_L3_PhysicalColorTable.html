<H1>Physical Color Table</H1><!-- entering slot 1187 -->
<P>
Each output device has its own<I> physical color table</I>, which is organized
like a logical color table. The physical color table contains the RGB color
definitions of the distinct colors that the device can produce, while a
logical color table contains the definitions of the colors as chosen by
an application. When an application draws on an output device, the PM maps
the index value that addresses the current color in the logical color table
to the index that retrieves the closest match for the current color in the
physical color table.
<P>
Because this substitution occurs when the graphics are drawn, the presentation
space can be associated with a number of different device contexts without
invalidating the logical color definitions. For example, an application
can create a picture on the screen using a wide range of colors, then direct
that drawing to an eight-pen vector plotter. The drawing is reproduced without
having to be re-created. Although the picture, as drawn by the plotter,
does not have the variety of colors displayed on the screen, the substitution
process selects the nearest match for each color on the screen from the
eight available colors on the plotter.
