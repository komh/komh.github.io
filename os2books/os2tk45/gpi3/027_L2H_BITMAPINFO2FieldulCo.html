<P>
<B>Encoding a run length:</B>
<P>
Run-length encoded bit maps are encoded in the buffer in a controlled format.
In all cases, if the first byte is non-zero, it is the length of a run of
pels of a particular color or, in the case of a BCA_RLE4 bit map, a run
of a length of pels of alternating colors.
<PRE>
1st-byte       pel repetition count &gt;= 1
2nd-4th bytes  (BCA_RLE24 only) RGB value of pel.
2nd-byte       (BCA_RLE8) color index of pel to be repeated
               (BCA_RLE4) the second byte contains 2 4-bit
               color indexes.  The repetition count is
               completed by alternately choosing the high-order
               nibble followed by the low-order nibble for the
               succeeding pels until the count is exhausted.

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Unencoded run:</B>
<P>
An unencoded run is a string of pels to be placed in consecutive positions
in the destination bit map.
<PRE>
1st-byte     0
2nd-byte     COUNT = a multiple of 3 for BCA_RLE24 bit maps, or
             COUNT &gt;= 3 (for BCA_RLE4 and BCA_RLE8 bit maps).

followed by the bytes as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->

BCA_RLE24<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> A string of bytes specifying the RGB
color values of succeeding pels.  If COUNT is odd, it must be padded by
a zero byte for an even length overall.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> BCA_RLE8
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>A string of bytes specifying color indexes for
succeeding pels. If COUNT is odd, it must be padded by a zero byte for an
even length overall.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> BCA_RLE4<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> A
string of bytes, each byte providing two color indexes, with the high-order
nibble specifying the index of the pel preceding the low-order nibble. The
COUNT specifies the number of indexes. The overall length of the string
must be an even number of bytes, and thus may be padded with a zero byte,
and the low order nibble of the last significant byte may also be zero and
not used.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL><B> Delta record:</B>
<P>
A delta record indicates a shift in position in the destination bit map
before the next record is decoded.
<PRE>
1st-byte        0
2nd-byte        2
3rd-byte        Delta-x (unsigned)
4th-byte        Delta-y (unsigned)

</PRE>

<P>
This is a relative jump record.  It implies that the next record is to be
decoded into a position in the destination bit map at an offset from the
current position, determined by changing the horizontal and vertical positions
by Delta-x and Delta-y, respectively.
<P>
<B>End-of-line record:</B>
<P>
The end-of-line record signifies that the data for the current scan line
is complete and that decoding of the next record should begin at the start
of the next scan line.
<PRE>
1st-byte        0
2nd-byte        0

</PRE>

<P>
<B>End-of-RLE record:</B>
<P>
The end-of-RLE record signifies the end of the data in the RLE compressed
bit map.
