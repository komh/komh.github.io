<P>
Graphics functions that change attributes are valid within the area bracket.
There are misconceptions, however, about which attributes are used when
the figures are displayed in a window or drawn to the printer.
<P>
Review the following functional sequence:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Function<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Effect<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 31 C4 2D --> GpiSetColor
</A> <!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Sets color to red.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 29 --> GpiBeginArea
</A> <!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Opens area bracket<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL>Sets color to green.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 2C --> GpiPolyLine
</A> <!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Draws two additional lines to form a triangle.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 2A -->GpiEndArea
</A> <!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Ends the area bracket and displays a picture.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If you are displaying on a color monitor, the image appears as follows:

<P>
The triangle has one red line, drawn with<A><!-- external link: 1D 99 C3 2B --> GpiLine
</A>and two green lines, drawn with<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 FC --> GpiPolyLine</A>.
The interior of the triangle, if drawn, is red. Red is the color that was
current when the area was defined and, therefore, is the current color for
the area interior. In terms of the interior area, green is only the color
that was current when the function that initiates drawing was called.
<P>
If the application immediately opened a new area bracket, the interior of
that bracket, if drawn, would be green. The color attribute for the second
AREABUNDLE, is not "inherited" from the last AREABUNDLE drawn.
<P>
