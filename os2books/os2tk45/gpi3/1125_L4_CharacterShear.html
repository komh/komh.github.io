<H1>Character Shear</H1><!-- entering slot 1146 -->
<P>
<I>Character shear</I> is the angle defined by the x-axis and a vector drawn
through the origin to a specified point in a Cartesian coordinate system.
Neither (0,0) nor the specified point need have any relation to the current
position. The operating system then aligns the vertical sides of the character
cell. If the font is an outline font, the operating system also aligns the
vertical strokes of the characters with the vector, regardless of the current
character mode, as shown in the following figure.
<P>
An application can retrieve the point that defines the character shear vector
using<A><!-- external link: 1D C8 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCharShear</A>. An application
can set the character shear using<A><!-- external link: 1D 2E C4 FC --> GpiSetCharShear</A>,
which accepts as input the x- and y-coordinates of a point that defines
the new vector in a <A HREF="334_L2_POINTL.html">POINTL</A> structure.
<P>
The<I> shear</I> of a character is the angle formed by the vertical lines
of the character cell, and it can affect both the positioning and shape
of characters in the character string. By default, the vertical lines of
a character cell are parallel to the y-axis of the presentation page. As
input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 2E C4 45 --> GpiSetCharShear</A> supply
the coordinates of the end point of a vector drawn from the origin (0,0).
The effects of the current character shear value vary, depending on the
current character mode and font type.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1125_L4_CharacterShear_25.gif" WIDTH=616 HEIGHT=559>
<P>
Effect of Character Shear on an Outline Font
<P>
The character cell is drawn with its vertical lines parallel to the vector
from the origin to (5,6). The character is sheared to the same degree.
<P>

<P>
The character-shear value is ignored if the current font is an image font
and the current character mode is CM_MODE1, as shown in the following figure.
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1125_L4_CharacterShear_26.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>
<P>
Effect of Character Shear on an Image Font in CM_MODE1
<P>
The character string is unaffected by the character-shear value.
<P>

<P>
The character-shear value affects the positioning of the characters from
an image font in CM_MODE2 only if character direction is CHDIRN_TOPBOTTOM
or CHDIRN_BOTTOMTOP. That is, characters drawn vertically do not appear
in a vertical line for nonzero shear angle from the vertical. The characters
themselves cannot be sheared, as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1125_L4_CharacterShear_27.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>
<P>
Effect of Character Shear on an Image Font in CM_MODE2
<P>
The character cell is sheared, and it controls the positioning of the characters;
the characters themselves are unchanged.
<P>

<P>
If the x- and y-coordinate values you specify in<A><!-- external link: 1D 2E C4 45 --> GpiSetCharShear
</A>are both positive and negative, the characters slant from lower left
to upper right. If you supply one negative and one positive value, the characters
slant from upper left to lower right, as illustrated in the following figure.
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1125_L4_CharacterShear_28.gif" WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=411>
<P>
Effect of X- and Y-Values on Character Shear
<P>
Character shear, like other attributes, has a default value that can be
changed using<A><!-- external link: 1D 35 C4 46 --> GpiSetDefAttrs</A> (CBB_SHEAR).
To reset the character shear to its default effect of drawing the vertical
lines of the character cell parallel to the y-axis, supply a coordinate
value of (0,1) on<A><!-- external link: 1D 2E C4 FC --> GpiSetCharShear</A>.
