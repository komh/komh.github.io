<P>
Area brackets have the flexibility to draw any combination of curved or
straight lines and combine the results into a closed figure. An advantage
that polygons sometimes have over area brackets, however, is that they require
fewer time-consuming calculations to provide that kind of flexibility.
<P>
The operating system provides a function that enables you to draw multiple
straight-line closed areas outside of an area bracket. Like bracket-generated
areas, they can be adjacent, intersecting, or completely separate.
<P>
The function is<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 4B --> GpiPolygons</A> and
the set of objects it draws are called<I> polygon primitives</I>. A polygon
primitive is any set of polygons with specified vertices that can be filled
or filled and outlined. This function accepts as input the desired number
of polygons, the POLYGON data structure for each polygon, and a boundary
and construction option similar to those of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 49 --> GpiBeginArea
</A>function.
<P>
The purpose of<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 4B --> GpiPolygons</A> is
to enable you to specify an area in such a way as to pass all of the area
boundaries at once. This improves performance significantly because the
operating system cannot process the accumulated primitives inside an area
bracket until it reaches a<A><!-- external link: 1D 8A C3 FC --> GpiEndArea</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 4B -->GpiPolygons</A> is not valid inside
an area bracket because the figures it defines are areas already.
<P>
Although<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 4B --> GpiPolygons</A> is limited
to straight line figures, it retains a great deal of flexibility. The polygon
data structure (POLYGON) contains the number of vertices, and the vertices
themselves are in world coordinates. The collection of POLYGON structures
accepted in a single<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 4B --> GpiPolygons</A> is
not limited to one type of polygon.
<P>
The drawing of the first polygon begins at the current position. For all
subsequent polygons, all vertices must be explicitly defined. If the individual
polygons are not completely defined, they are closed with a straight line
drawn from the last defined vertex to the first.
<P>
After the application has defined the polygons, they may be transformed
and manipulated just as other primitives are.
