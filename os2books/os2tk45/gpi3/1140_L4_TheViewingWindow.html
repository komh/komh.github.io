<P>
The<I> viewing window</I> defines a rectangular clipping boundary in model
space. It is defined with<A><!-- external link: 1D 5B C4 FC --> GpiSetViewingLimits</A>.
As input to this function, you supply the model coordinates of the lower-left
and upper-right corners of the viewing window.
<P>
When a drawing primitive, such as a line, intersects a viewing window, any
part of that line outside of the viewing window is clipped. Any point on
the boundary of the viewing window is considered within the window, and
is not clipped. By default, the viewing window performs no clipping. In
this case, all graphics output in the model space is transformed. The following
figure shows how the viewing window outlines a part of model space.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1140_L4_TheViewingWindow_37.gif" WIDTH=494 HEIGHT=137> The

This example shows how a presentation page is constructed. The viewing window
outlines the tail of the aircraft, which is scaled and translated when drawn
in presentation-page space. The rest of the aircraft is clipped away during
the drawing process.
