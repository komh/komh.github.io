<H1>About Creating and Drawing Retained Graphics</H1><!-- entering slot 1110 -->
<P>
An application draws by calling graphics functions. Applications store retained
graphics in<I> segments</I>, which can be edited. This means that the retained
image can be modified without having to re-create the unmodified portion
using multiple GPI functions.
<P>
When using nonretained graphics, the output appears on the output device
(for example, a window) immediately. However, if part of the picture is
erased or must be repeated, the application must call the same graphics
functions a second, or even a third time.
<P>
There are many other advantages to using retained graphics, including:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Convenience</B>-An application can draw retained
graphics with a single function that accesses the storage area containing
all the individual functions necessary for the object.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Flexibility</B>-An application can redraw graphics
retained in the segment store to any number of device contexts.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Editing</B>-An application can modify an object
without having to call all the functions necessary to re-create the picture.
Individual segments can be moved, scaled, or rotated; then, redrawn.
<P>
Editing the graphics within a segment is described in<A><!-- external link: 1D F3 C5 39 --> Editing
Retained Graphics and Graphics Segments</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Power</B>-An application can access the more powerful
and useful graphics functions only when graphics are stored in segments.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B>Organization</B>-An application can use segments
to store the components that will be assembled into the final picture.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Primarily, a graphics segment is a means of grouping and storing graphics
primitives and their attributes. Although the graphics within a segment
usually are related in some way, they do not have to be. A segment might
contain a number of unrelated GPI functions that you want to keep and execute
at specific times.
<P>
Retained graphics do affect application performance, however, in that a
normal presentation space requires 114KB of main memory more than a micro
presentation space, and using the drawing mode DM_RETAIN adds an additional
46KB.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Your application can have up to 16KB (16378) segments in the
segment store of a single presentation space. The size of an individual
segment is limited only by the amount of storage available to you.
<P>
Do not confuse a graphics segment with a memory segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
