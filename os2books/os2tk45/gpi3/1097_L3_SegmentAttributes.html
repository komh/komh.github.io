<H1>Segment Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 1118 -->
<P>
Each segment, whether retained or nonretained, has a number of characteristics,
called<I> attributes</I> that you can set in accordance with your application's
requirements. The attributes of a segment are quite different from those
of a graphics primitive in that segment attributes have ON and OFF settings.
There are seven segment attributes. However, only two are described in this
chapter: <I> chained</I> (ATTR_CHAINED) and<I> fast-chained</I> (ATTR_FASTCHAIN).

<P>
When an application creates a segment in a presentation space, the operating
system assigns initial attributes to it. By default, five of the attributes
will be set ON and two will be set OFF. The chained and fast-chained attributes
are set ON. Your application can alter these values using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3F C4 2A --> GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs
</A>or retrieve the values of the current initial attributes using<A><!-- external link: 1D E7 C3 FC --> GpiQueryInitialSegmentAttrs</A>.

<P>
The chain attribute tells the operating system to add each new segment in
your application's presentation space to the segment chain. The fast-chained
attribute tells the operating system to prevent the resetting of the primitive
attributes to their default values before drawing the segment chain.
