<H1>Attribute Modes</H1><!-- entering slot 1126 -->
<P>
You can change primitive-attribute settings at any time. The new values
you specify replace the existing values. For example, if the current foreground
color is green and you change it to red, red replaces green as the foreground
color attribute.
<P>
When you set primitive attributes within a retained or nonretained segment,
you can save the existing attribute values on a last-in-first-out (LIFO)
stack, from where they can later be retrieved and made current again. You
do this by selecting either of the two attribute modes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->AM_PRESERVE mode-Also known as<I> push-and-set mode
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->AM_NOPRESERVE mode-Also known as<I> set mode</I>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
In AM_NOPRESERVE mode, which is the default setting, existing attribute
values are replaced by any new attribute values that you supply. In AM_PRESERVE
mode, the existing attribute values are stored on a LIFO stack, and then
the new values that you specify take effect. AM_PRESERVE mode also causes
the current position to be saved if the position was specified using<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 FC --> GpiSetCurrentPosition</A>.
If you use<A><!-- external link: 1D A0 C3 3D --> GpiMove</A> to set the
current position, the position is not saved, regardless of the attribute
mode.
<P>
To select a current attribute mode, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 1F C4 FC --> GpiSetAttrMode</A>.
The current attribute mode affects subsequent attribute-setting requests
in the presentation space. Attribute modes are not applicable to micro presentation
spaces, because graphics segments can be created only in normal presentation
spaces.
<P>
To retrieve an attribute value from the LIFO stack, use<A><!-- external link: 1D B2 C3 FC --> GpiPop</A>,
which pulls back the attribute that was stored most recently on the stack.
You can retrieve more than one attribute value by supplying a number as
an input parameter of this function. For example, if you specify 4,<A><!-- external link: 1D B2 C3 3E --> GpiPop
</A>retrieves the four attributes that were most recently stored on the
stack. If each of the values retrieved applies the same type of attribute
to the same primitive (for example, if all four are line-type settings),
the last one to be retrieved (and, therefore, the first one on the stack)
becomes the current setting.
<P>
If you save attribute values from any segment called from another segment,
and do not retrieve the values using<A><!-- external link: 1D B2 C3 FC --> GpiPop</A>,
the values are restored automatically when the end of the segment is reached.
If you save attribute values from any segment that is not called from another
segment and do not explicitly restore those values using<A><!-- external link: 1D B2 C3 FC --> GpiPop</A>,
they are lost at the end of the segment.
<P>
The AM_PRESERVE mode is useful when you do not want attributes in calling
segments to be overwritten by attributes specified in the called segments.
This overwriting happens because a calling segment and the segments it calls
are logically one object. Attribute changes within a called segment remain
current upon return to the calling segment. If you set some attribute values
at the start of a called segment, and the current attribute mode is AM_PRESERVE,
the attribute values of the calling segment are stored on the LIFO stack.
At the end of the called segment, the values on the stack are retrieved
automatically so that the calling segment continues with its own attribute
values.
