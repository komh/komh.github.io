<H1>Nonretained Graphic Segments</H1><!-- entering slot 1132 -->
<P>
It is valid segment construction to create a segment bracket while the drawing
mode is DM_DRAW. The GPI functions contained within the bracket are drawn
immediately rather than being retained for future use. This type of segment
is called a<I> nonretained segment</I>.
<P>
Because the usual reason for constructing segments is to take advantage
of retained graphics, nonretained segments might appear as a contradiction
in terms at first. However, there are four particular advantages in their
use:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
