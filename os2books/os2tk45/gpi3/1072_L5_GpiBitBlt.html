<H1>GpiBitBlt</H1><!-- entering slot 1092 -->
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 -->GpiBitBlt</A> requires an application
to use device coordinates for the dimensions of the source and target rectangles.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 -->GpiBitBlt</A> allows you to direct
bit maps to devices other than the screen. It is independent of the drawing
mode, but it operates as if in draw mode.
<P>
At its simplest,<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 --> GpiBitBlt</A> copies
a whole bit map, unaltered, from a device or bit map source to a device
or bit map target. At its most powerful,<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 --> GpiBitBlt
</A>can take a part of or a whole bit map, and alter both its size and appearance
in the process of copying it to another device context. A bit map can be
copied:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From one memory device context to another memory device
context<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From a memory device context to the device context
of an output device (screen window or printer) that supports raster operations
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the device context of an output device to a memory
device context<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->From the device context of an output device to another
device context of the same output device. In both cases, the screen device
can be a PM window.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A memory device context (whether it is the source or the target of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 --> GpiBitBlt
</A>operation)<I> must</I> have a bit map selected when<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 --> GpiBitBlt
</A>is called.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 32 -->GpiBitBlt</A> has a number of input
parameters, two of which are the handles of two presentation spaces:  the
source presentation space and the target presentation space. Both of these
presentation spaces must be associated with an appropriate device context.
Unless the associated device is a banded printer, a single presentation
space can be both source and target. This allows you to copy a bit map within
a single PM window, or to update the bit map. The source and target rectangles
are specified in device coordinates in<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 FC --> GpiBitBlt</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 FC -->GpiBitBlt</A>, consequently, is very
device-dependent, and should be avoided when creating data for interchange.
