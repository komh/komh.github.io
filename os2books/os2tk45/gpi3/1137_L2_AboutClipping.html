<H1>About Clipping</H1><!-- entering slot 1159 -->
<P>
<I>Clipping</I> enables the PM to discard parts of a picture that lie outside
a specified<I> clipping boundary</I>. The parts of the picture enclosed
by the boundary are said to be inside the<I> clipping area</I>. A clipping
area might be a single rectangle or a complex shape, depending on the method
used to define it.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In this chapter, the word<I> area</I> does not refer to an
<I>area primitive</I>; it describes the shape or shapes used for clipping
graphics output.
<P>
If an application attempts to draw outside of a clipping area, the operating
system ensures that the output does not appear on the drawing surface of
the output device. For example, if an application defined a triangular clipping
area before drawing text output, all text outside of the triangle would
be discarded, even though an entire page of text was defined. The following
figure illustrates the result.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1137_L2_AboutClipping_34.gif" WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=180>

<P>
Clipping boundaries are defined by the application. The PM performs some
clipping automatically when, for example, your application's graphic output
is clipped to fit a client window area or the device's output area for a
hardcopy device.
