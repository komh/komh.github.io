<H1>Copying Images from a Display into a Bit Map</H1><!-- entering slot 1099 -->
<P>
An application can copy an image from a raster display screen to a bit map
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 23 --> GpiBitBlt</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 FC --> GpiWCBitBlt</A>.
Before copying the bit map, the application must call DevOpenDC to create
a memory device context. This device context allows an application to treat
a bit map in memory as though it were a device-the application can copy
color information from pels on the display to the bit map.
<P>
Once an application creates a memory device context, associates it with
a presentation space, and selects a bit map into the presentation space,
the application can use the presentation-space handle as the first argument
to<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 23 --> GpiBitBlt</A> or<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 FC --> GpiWCBitBlt</A>.
If the application will be drawing the image on devices with different aspect
ratios, the application should use<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 24 --> GpiWCBitBlt
</A>to preserve the original dimensions of the bit map.
