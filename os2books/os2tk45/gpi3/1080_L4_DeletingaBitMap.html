<H1>Deleting a Bit Map</H1><!-- entering slot 1101 -->
<P>
It is good practice always to delete a bit map from memory when you have
finished using it. To delete a bit map, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 79 C3 FC --> GpiDeleteBitmap</A>.
If you have loaded a bit map from a resource file,<A><!-- external link: 1D 79 C3 10 --> GpiDeleteBitmap
</A>deletes only its memory version. If the bit map has not been deleted
when the owning process ends, it is deleted automatically by the system.
