<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 C3 24 -->GpiImage</A> draws a nonstandard,
monochrome (two-color) bit map called an<I> image primitive</I>. The bit-map
bits in an image are stored in the opposite order from the bits in a standard
bit map-the first bit in the bit map corresponds to the pel in the upper-left
corner of the bit-map image, and the last bit in the bit map corresponds
to the pel in the lower-right corner of the bit-map image. The following
figure shows the correspondence between the bits in an image primitive and
the pels in the drawing produced by<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 C3 FC --> GpiImage</A>.

A call to<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 C3 24 --> GpiImage</A> also is valid
only in draw mode (DM_DRAW), but can provide output to a screen or printer.
An application cannot scale bit-map images by using<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 C3 FC --> GpiImage</A>.
