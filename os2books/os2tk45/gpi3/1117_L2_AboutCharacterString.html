A PM application must make certain choices about fonts in preparation for
text display or printing. Often these choices are driven by selections from
a user. After the selections are made, as discussed in<A><!-- external link: 1D F8 C5 FC --> Fonts</A>,
the application can make additional decisions about the appearance of the
individual characters within the font by setting attributes in the CHARBUNDLE
data structure. CHARBUNDLE is the lowest of three levels of data structures
that define the appearance of displayed or printed text. The other two,
FONTMETRICS and FATTRS, are described in<A><!-- external link: 1D F8 C5 FC --> Fonts</A>.

<P>
A font family-for instance, Helvetica** or Courier-is a collection of fonts.
Fonts within the same family share certain attributes such as<I> stroke
width</I> and<I> serif characteristics</I>. Stroke width refers to the width
of lines used to draw characters and symbols from a font. A serif is a short
crossline drawn at the ends of the main strokes that form a character or
symbol.
<P>
Individual fonts within a family differ from each other in the following
ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Height<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Line weight<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Appearance<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Height refers to the point size of a font. A common example of line weight
is<B> boldface</B>. A common example of appearance is<I> italic</I>.
<P>
The most important factor that affects the CHARBUNDLE attributes is whether
the current font is an<I> image</I> or an<I> outline</I> font. The following
figure shows an example of the difference.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1117_L2_AboutCharacterString_17.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=362>

Image and Outline Fonts
<P>

<P>
Outline fonts are composed of characters drawn with straight and curved
lines. Image fonts, also called bit map fonts, are composed of pels arranged
in certain shapes.
