<H1>Dithering</H1><!-- entering slot 1202 -->
<P>
If an application requests a color not available in the physical color table,
the operating system can approximate the color by a process called<I> dithering</I>.
For example, if the physical color table does not contain a light green
color but does contain a yellow and a green, the operating system can create
what appears to be light green by mixing yellow pels and green pels. Dithering
is a variation on the way red, green, and blue color guns illuminate the
phosphors in a single pel to produce a color that is not pure red, green,
or blue (for example, yellow).
<P>
The dithering process takes advantage of the way the human eye interprets
color. If every other pel is set to one color, and all the intermediate
pels to a different color, together they produce the effect of a third color
at normal viewing distances.
<P>
The checkerboard effect is just one of the ways in which dithering can be
implemented. Dithering works only when producing a solid mass of color,
such as an area fill pattern. It does not have the desired effect on line
primitives.
<P>
Dithering is especially important on monochrome devices. By combining various
combinations of black pels with white pels, the operating system can create
numerous shades of gray.
<P>
To use only the pure colors defined in the physical color table, that is,
to prevent color dithering, set LCOL_PURECOLOR in<A><!-- external link: 1D 74 C3 FC --> GpiCreateLogColorTable</A>.
When LCOL_PURECOLOR is set, the nearest available color to the one selected
is used.
