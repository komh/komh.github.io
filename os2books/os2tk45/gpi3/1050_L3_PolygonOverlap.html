<H1>Polygon Overlap</H1><!-- entering slot 1070 -->
<P>
An application specifies which pels are drawn when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 FC --> GpiPolygons</A>.
There are two options:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_INCL (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_EXCL.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When the overlap value is POLYGON_INCL, the bottom right is included in
the polygon. The value POLYGON_EXCL, the exclusive value, indicates that
the bottom right is excluded from the polygon. This value acts in conjunction
with the mix attribute in determining the appearance of a polygon, which
is especially important for a group of overlapping or adjacent polygons.

<P>
For example,<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 31 --> GpiPolygons</A> specifies
a number of polygons. Two of the polygons share the vertex pair (6,7) and
(9,7). When the polygons are drawn, if the overlap value was POLYGON_INCL,
there are two distinct lines to be drawn from (6,7) to (9,7). A mix attribute
other than FM_OVERPAINT could cause undesirable results as the line and
drawing-surface colors mix.
<P>
As with the polygon boundary and construction values, the overlap value
can be ORed when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 31 --> GpiPolygons
</A>to create a specific effect.
