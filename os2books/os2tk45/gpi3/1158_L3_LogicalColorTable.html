<H1>Logical Color Table</H1><!-- entering slot 1180 -->
<P>
A logical color table contains a variable number of entries, each of which
describes a different RGB (Red, Green, Blue) combination that produces a
color. The principle of the color table is illustrated in the following
figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1158_L3_LogicalColorTable_43.gif" WIDTH=497 HEIGHT=328>

Logical Color Table
<P>
This simplified example demonstrates that to produce yellow on the computer
screen, red and green are mixed in equal intensities, and no blue is used
at all. In this example, yellow is addressed in the color table by index
21. Notice that this is not the same index number used in the default logical
color table, which indicates that this color table has been changed by the
application.
<P>

<P>
A logical color table is stored in a presentation space and is specific
to that presentation space. A logical color table enables applications to
specify colors as indexes rather than explicit RGB values.
<P>
The colors displayed are likely to vary from one output device to another
so the definitions in the color table can be fine-tuned to get the best
results. Any color can be made more or less intense by altering its definition
in the logical color table.
