<P>
When using FM_OVERPAINT, the foreground of the primitive replaces any existing
drawing in the same area of the presentation page. If the existing drawing
is yellow, for example, and the new drawing is red, the drawing is red at
the points of overlap. (This is the default foreground mix attribute.) Because
one color is replacing another and no color mixing is being performed, the
effects of the overpaint mix attribute are entirely predictable. This is
shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1174_L4_OverpaintMixAttribut_46.gif" WIDTH=513 HEIGHT=370>

Overpaint Foreground Mix Attribute

The circle is drawn on top of the square. At the points of overlap, the
output is the color of the circle.

When using BM_OVERPAINT, the primitive background replaces the existing
drawing. drawing, as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1174_L4_OverpaintMixAttribut_47.gif" WIDTH=623 HEIGHT=449>

Overpaint Background Mix Attribute
<P>
Using BM_OVERPAINT, the background of the primitive is apparent only if
it is drawn in a different color from the output-area background. Notice
that, in this example, the foreground mix attribute is FM_OVERPAINT.
