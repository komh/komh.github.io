<H1>Graphics Orders</H1><!-- entering slot 385 -->
<P>
This section describes the format of the graphics orders.
<P>
Graphics orders are used in the following circumstances:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Using<A><!-- external link: 1D 95 C3 44 --> GpiGetData
</A>or<A><!-- external link: 1D B5 C3 46 --> GpiPutData</A> functions for
bulk transfer of part or all of graphics segment data (unless this is simply
being copied without being changed).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Editing segments with<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 47 --> GpiQueryElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 FC --> GpiElement</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Generating metafiles (other than through the Presentation
Manager API), or examining their contents. The data part of Graphics Data
structured fields within the metafile (see "Metafile Data Format" in the
<I>Presentation Manager Programming Reference</I>) consists of graphics
orders.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When primitive or attribute functions (plus certain other functions) are
specified at the programming interface, and the drawing mode (see<A><!-- external link: 1D 3A C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawingMode</A>)
is set to<B> drawandretain</B>, graphics orders are constructed and placed
in the current graphics segment. One API call often causes a single order
to be generated. Sometimes, however, several orders are necessary: an example
of this is where a<A><!-- external link: 1D AE C3 45 --> GpiPolyLine</A> call
is issued, which specifies more strokes than there is room for, in a single
order.
<P>
In either case, the order or orders generated by a single API call comprise
a single<B> element</B>, unless the application specifically starts an element
using the<A><!-- external link: 1D 60 C3 41 --> GpiBeginElement</A> function.
In this case the element consists of all of the orders generated between
this and the following<A><!-- external link: 1D 8B C3 43 --> GpiEndElement
</A>function. A<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 47 --> GpiQueryElement</A> function
returns the orders that comprise an element; the application may edit these,
and return them to the segment with<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 FC --> GpiElement</A>.
The <A HREF="402_L2_BeginElement.html">Begin Element</A> - <A HREF="520_L2_EndElement.html">End
Element</A> orders that surround a multi-order element in the segment are
never passed between the application and the system on<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 47 --> GpiQueryElement
</A>and<A><!-- external link: 1D 89 C3 42 --> GpiElement</A> functions.

<P>
No double word or word alignment can be assumed for orders either within
segments or during editing.
