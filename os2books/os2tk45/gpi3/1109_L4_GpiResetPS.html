When a presentation space is first created, it is in a neutral state. Current
attributes are set to their initial default values. The current position
is (0,0). The segment store contains no segments, and there are no application-defined
resources, such as logical color tables.
<P>
You can return an existing presentation space to this state using<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 FC --> GpiResetPS</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 2D -->GpiResetPS</A> has three levels of
reset activity, each more powerful than the last. These are:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GRES_ATTRS, which is equivalent to the processing
done by<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC --> GpiCloseSegment</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GRES_SEGMENTS, which is equivalent to creating
a new presentation space, but without deleting any logical resources. All
retained segments are deleted from the segment store.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->GRES_ALL, which is equivalent to creating a new
presentation space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
