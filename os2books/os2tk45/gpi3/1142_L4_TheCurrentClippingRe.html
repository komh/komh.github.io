<H1>The Current Clipping Region</H1><!-- entering slot 1164 -->
<P>
<I>Clipping regions</I> are clipping areas defined (as regions) by one or
more rectangles in device coordinates. Because they are defined in device
coordinates, clipping regions do not suffer from the rounding errors associated
with other types of clipping. Therefore, they are ideally suited to redraw
part of the picture without boundary discontinuities, for example, after
a BitBlt operation has been used to scroll a picture in a window.
<P>
Regions are not available automatically for clipping. To select an existing
region as the current clipping region, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A>.
By default, the clipping region is the same size as the drawing surface.
Only one clipping region can exist in the presentation space at one time.
To end clipping to the current clipping region, deselect it by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 6A --> GpiSetClipRegion
</A>with a NULL region handle. A deselected clipping region retains the
effects of any changes made to it while it was a clipping region and can
be reselected.
<P>
You do not have to deselect the current clipping region before selecting
another. Each selected clipping region automatically replaces the one before
it. If a clipping region exists when you call<A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A>,
the existing clipping region reverts to being a normal region, and its handle
is returned.
<P>
Clip paths and clip regions share a common implementation, but clip regions
are faster to create than clip paths. This might be a performance factor
when designing your application for repairing the screen or redrawing the
picture in a client window after the display has changed. The following
figure illustrates this use of regions.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1142_L4_TheCurrentClippingRe_39.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=162>

<P>
<B>Note: </B><A><!-- external link: 1D 30 C4 FC --> GpiSetClipRegion</A> does
not cause graphics orders to be added to the current segment. Therefore,
variations in the clip region must not be used to construct the picture.
The clip region is intended to define a fixed clipping area for the entire
picture.
<P>
When you select the current clipping region, none of the region-related
GPI functions can be used for that region. The PM provides a series of functions
that<I> mirror</I> the region-related functions. However, all of these functions
work in world coordinates rather than device coordinates, and, therefore,
are subject to current transformations.
<P>
Any of the following functions can be used to get information about or to
redefine the current clipping region.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><B><A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 FC -->GpiQueryClipBox
</A></B>
<P>
You can request the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that encloses all
current clipping boundaries by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D CB C3 FC --> GpiQueryClipBox</A>.
The following boundaries are included in this calculation:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Current clip path<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Current viewing window<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Current graphics field<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Current clipping region<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Visible region of the window<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C3 FC -->GpiIntersectClipRectangle
</A></B>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 97 C3 65 -->GpiIntersectClipRectangle</A> redefines
the current clipping region to the intersection of the existing clipping
region with the rectangle whose dimensions you supply in this function.
This has the same effect as CRGN_AND in<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> GpiCombineRegion</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 FC -->GpiExcludeClipRectangle
</A></B>
<P>
You also can redefine the current clipping region using<A><!-- external link: 1D 90 C3 FC --> GpiExcludeClipRectangle</A>.
This function excludes a specified rectangle from the current region and
has the same effect as CRGN_DIFF on<A><!-- external link: 1D 6B C3 FC --> GpiCombineRegion</A>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC -->GpiOffsetClipRegion
</A></B>
<P>
The current clipping region can be moved from its current position using
<A><!-- external link: 1D A1 C3 FC -->GpiOffsetClipRegion</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><A><!-- external link: 1D B4 C3 FC -->GpiPtVisible
</A></B>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D B4 C3 67 -->GpiPtVisible</A> tells you whether
a point, expressed in world coordinates, is visible on the screen. A point
is visible if it is within all current clipping boundaries and is in the
visible region of the window.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><B><A><!-- external link: 1D 14 C4 FC -->GpiRectVisible
</A></B>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 14 C4 69 -->GpiRectVisible</A> tells you whether
any part or the whole of a rectangle, whose dimensions you supply in world
coordinates, is visible on the screen. The rectangle is visible if it intersects
both the visible region of the window and all current clipping boundaries.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
