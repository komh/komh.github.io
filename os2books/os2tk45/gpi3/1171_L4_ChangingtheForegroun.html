<H1>Changing the Foreground and Background Colors of Primitives</H1><!-- entering slot 1193 -->
<P>
To change the current foreground color, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 31 C4 FC --> GpiSetColor</A>.
As input, the application supplies either the index to the required color
in the current logical color table or the RGB value of the color, depending
on the mode of the table. Color indexes higher than those supplied in the
default color table must be loaded explicitly before they can be used.
<P>
It is possible to specify one of the system colors (for example, SYSCLR_ACTIVEBORDER)
as the current foreground (or background) color of a primitive. The color
appears as defined in the system color table, and the logical color table
is not used.
<P>
The specified color becomes the current color, and the foreground of any
primitive drawn subsequently is drawn in that color. The current foreground
color for a particular primitive type is set by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 FC --> GpiSetAttrs</A>.
For example, if an application sets the current foreground color to CLR_RED
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 31 C4 FC --> GpiSetColor</A>, and sets
the current foreground color for marker primitives to CLR_CYAN by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 20 C4 FC -->GpiSetAttrs</A>, all subsequent markers
are cyan, and all other primitives are red.
<P>
To change the current primitive background color, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 21 C4 FC --> GpiSetBackColor</A>.
To ensure that this color is different from the background color of the
output area (so that the entire primitive background is visible), the current
window background color must not be the same as the current primitive background
color. Also, select an appropriate background mix attribute.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D B9 C3 34 -->GpiQueryBackColor</A> returns the
current background color setting for a character primitive. To learn the
current foreground color setting, use<A><!-- external link: 1D CD C3 FC --> GpiQueryColor</A>.
<A><!-- external link: 1D B8 C3 33 -->GpiQueryAttrs</A> can be used to determine
the current foreground and background color values for a single primitive
type.
