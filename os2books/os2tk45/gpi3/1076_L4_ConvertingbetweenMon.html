<H1>Converting between Monochrome and Color Data Bit Maps</H1><!-- entering slot 1097 -->
<P>
It is possible to copy a monochrome bit map to a color bit map or device,
and to copy a color bit map to a monochrome bit map or device. PM handles
these conversions automatically according to the following rules:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you are copying a monochrome bit map to a color
bit map or to a color or monochrome device surface, a source setting of
1 adopts the current image-foreground color of the target presentation space,
and a source setting of 0 adopts the current image-background color of the
target presentation space. For example, if the image foreground color is
blue and the image background color is yellow in the target presentation
space, a monochrome bit map is converted to a blue foreground on a yellow
background.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you are copying from a monochrome pattern to a
color bit map or device, a source setting of 1 adopts the current area-foreground
color of the target device and a source setting of 0 adopts the current
area-background color of the target device. Note that if image bundle attributes
do not exist for the source bit map, as is the case when using<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 29 --> GpiWCBitBlt
</A>(which uses a bit map handle as the source), then zero source pixels
adopt the image background color and nonzero source pixels adopt the image-foreground
color of the presentation space.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->If you are copying a color bit map to a monochrome
bit map or device, those pels that have the same color as the current image-background
color in the source presentation space adopt the image background color
of the target presentation space. For example, if the current image-background
color in the source presentation space is blue, all blue pels in the bit
map take on the color of the current image background in the target presentation
space.
<P>
All other pels in the color bit map adopt the current image foreground color
of the target presentation space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
