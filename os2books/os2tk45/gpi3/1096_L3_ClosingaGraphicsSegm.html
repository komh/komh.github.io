<P>
When you have finished creating a graphics segment, close it using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC --> GpiCloseSegment</A>.
There can be only one open segment at a time in a single graphics presentation
space, so you must close one segment before going on to the next.
<P>
There is some degree of clean-up processing associated with using<A><!-- external link: 1D 6A C3 FC --> GpiCloseSegment</A>,
known as<I> close-segment processing</I>, that can make current attribute
values unreliable. For more information about the effects of<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 19 --> GpiOpenSegment

attributes, see<A><!-- external link: 1D 16 C6 1B --> Graphics Attributes</A>.
