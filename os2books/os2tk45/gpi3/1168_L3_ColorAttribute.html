<H1>Color Attribute</H1><!-- entering slot 1190 -->
<P>
The PM graphic interface uses a variety of colors. These colors are referred
to as the<I> system colors</I>, and they are defined in the system color
table, which is separate from an application's logical color table. To find
out the RGB values of the system colors, call WinQuerySysColor.
<P>
The colors of graphic primitives are specified separately from the system
colors. Every primitive has a foreground color, and some also have a background
color.
