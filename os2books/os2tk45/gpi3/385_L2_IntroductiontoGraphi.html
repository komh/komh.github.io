<H1>Introduction to Graphics Orders</H1><!-- entering slot 386 -->
<P>
In the retain and draw-and-retain drawing modes, specific GPI functions
(primitive-drawing and attribute-setting functions, plus some others) cause
graphics orders to be stored in the current segment. A graphics order is
a sequence of one or more bytes of data that describe a graphics function.
There is typically a one-to-one correspondence between a GPI function and
a graphics order. You do not need to understand the various formats and
contents of the graphics orders, unless:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

of data that you want to edit.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You are simply copying data from one segment to another.

</A>to add data to a segment, or<A><!-- external link: 1D DD C3 2F --> GpiQueryElement
</A>to retrieve data from a segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You are examining the contents of a metafile.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Both the graphics orders and the metafile structure are described in the
Presentation Manager. This appendix describes the header file PMORD.H, which
has been provided to allow you to manipulate the graphics orders more easily.
