<P>
Your application can draw a complete segment chain with<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 FC --> GpiDrawChain</A>.
The segments are drawn in the order in which they appear in the chain. For
example, the segments in the following figure are drawn in the following
order:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 1<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment A<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment B<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 2<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment B<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 3.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Chained and Called Segments
<P>
Segment A is called by root segment 1, and segment B is called by both segment
A and root segment 2. Segment C calls segment D. Both C and D are unchained
segments that are not called from the segment chain, and consequently, are
not part of the segment chain.
<P>

<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 56 C4 3C -->GpiSetSegmentPriority</A> changes
the position of a root segment (which must not be a zero segment) in the
chain. As input to this function, you supply the name of the segment you
want to reorder and the name of a reference segment. The<I> reference segment
</I>is the segment that either will be immediately before, or immediately
after, the reordered segment's new position in the chain.
<P>
If the segment you are moving is to come after the reference segment in
the chain, it is said to have a<I> higher priority</I> (HIGHER_PRI). If
it is to come before the reference segment, it is said to have a<I> lower
priority</I> (LOWER_PRI). The nearer a segment is to the end of the chain,
the higher its priority.
<P>
If you supply the name of an unchained segment as input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 56 C4 FC --> GpiSetSegmentPriority</A>,
the segment is added to the chain in the position you specify. To learn
the position of a segment in the chain, use<A><!-- external link: 1D 09 C4 FC --> GpiQuerySegmentPriority</A>.

<P>
If your application called the following functions:
<PRE>GpiSetSegmentPriority (hps, C, 2, LOWER_PRI)GpiSetSegmentPriority (hps, 3, 0, HIGHER_PRI)
GpiSetSegmentPriority (hps, B, 0, LOWER_PRI)
</PRE>
the segment chain in the previous figure would appear as in the following
figure; and<A><!-- external link: 1D 85 C3 3A --> GpiDrawChain</A> would
draw the segments in the following order:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 3<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 1<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment A<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment B<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Segment C<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment D.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Root segment 2<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Unchained segment B.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Segment B<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
