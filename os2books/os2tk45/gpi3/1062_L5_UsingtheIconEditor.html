<H1>Using the Icon Editor</H1><!-- entering slot 1082 -->
<P>
Using the Icon Editor, you can create monochrome or color bit maps that
have a<I> static appearance</I>. This means that the bit maps can be created
in advance and then used without change while the application is running.

<P>
When you use the Icon Editor to create a bit map, the bit map is saved in
a resource file that can be loaded whenever it is needed. To load a bit-map
file, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 9A C3 FC --> GpiLoadBitmap</A>, with
the identifier of the resource file that contains the bit map, as the second
parameter. If you allow this value to default, the application's .EXE file
is assumed to contain the bit map.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 9A C3 39 -->GpiLoadBitmap</A> lets you specify
the x- and y-dimensions (in pels) of the bit map. The loaded bit map is
stretched or compressed accordingly. If you supply a 0 value for one of
these dimensions, the bit map is sized in the other dimension only, which
is likely to cause distortion of the image. If the bit map is to be produced
in its original size, specify 0 for both its width and its height.
<P>
Output from the call to this function is the bit-map handle. To display
the loaded bit map on the screen, follow the sequence of steps described
in the preceding section, omitting steps 3 (defining the bit map) and 5
(issuing drawing instructions to the presentation space).
<P>
A bit map created by the Icon Editor is saved in a device-independent format.
This format generates an array of bit maps with formats (bits per pel) matching
each of the supported display devices.
