<H1>Color Output and Mix Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 1194 -->
<P>
A<I> mix attribute</I> is a bitwise operation on the color indexes in a
device's logical color table. Mix attributes enable colors to be specified
in relation to other colors. When an application draws a graphics primitive,
the operating system uses a mix attribute to determine the color that appears
on the output device.
<P>
For example, instead of specifying that a line should be black and, therefore,
invisible if the background also is black, an application can use a mix
attribute of FM_XOR to specify that the line always should be drawn the
inverse of the background color.
<P>
Suppose an application has set the<B> lColor</B> field in the LINEBUNDLE
structure to CLR_RED and the<B> usMixMode</B> field in the same structure
to FM_OR. The current color of the drawing surface is CLR_GREEN. To determine
the color of a line, the operating system performs a bitwise OR operation
on the indexes of these colors, as follows:
<PRE>          0010  (the default index for red)
          0100  (the default index for green)
         ------
          0110  (result of bitwise OR)
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the result is 6-the index for yellow. This means that even
though the application specified CLR_RED in the LINEBUNDLE structure, a
yellow line appears when the application calls any of the functions that
draw a line primitive.
