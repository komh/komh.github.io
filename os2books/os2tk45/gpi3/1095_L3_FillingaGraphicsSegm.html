<P>
After a graphics segment is opened, the GPI functions that follow become
a part of a retained segment and are executed every time the segment itself
is drawn.
<P>
The typical GPI functions that would be called are those that:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create graphics primitives-such as lines or markers
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Assign attributes to those primitives-such as color
or line type.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
However, there are a few GPI functions that you cannot call while there
is an open segment-for example a second<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 FC --> GpiOpenSegment</A>.
These functions are identified in<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C4 30 --> GPI
Function Context</A>.
<P>
A presentation space can contain many segments. Each time you open a new
segment, many attributes reset themselves to default values. Therefore,
the current position and attribute values that apply before you call<A><!-- external link: 1D A4 C3 31 --> GpiOpenSegment
</A>cannot be guaranteed to be in effect after you call the function. Beginning
each segment with a number of attribute-setting requests and, possibly,
with<A><!-- external link: 1D 33 C4 FC --> GpiSetCurrentPosition</A>, is
recommended. Your application also might take advantage of<A><!-- external link: 1D 35 C4 FC --> GpiSetDefAttrs</A>,
for example, to minimize the number of attributes that must be dealt with
upon opening a new segment.
