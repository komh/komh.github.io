<H1>About Color and Mix Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 1176 -->
<P>
Color and mix are two attributes of graphics primitives. They can be specified
by an application in a number of ways, and are specified in the ...BUNDLE
data structures associated with the five graphics primitives and in bit
maps. Bit maps and some of the primitives have both foreground and background
color attributes. For example, a character string primitive has a foreground
color attribute that specifies the color of the character and a background
color attribute that specifies the color of the character cell surrounding
the character.
<P>
The mix attribute controls how each primitive is combined with the existing
drawing. Among other things, it affects the color that results when primitives
of different colors overlap. Primitives with foreground and background color
attributes also have foreground and background mix attributes.
