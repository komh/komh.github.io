<H1>Saving a Bit Map</H1><!-- entering slot 1100 -->
<P>
You have two ways to save a bit map that has been created by an application:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Store the bit map in a<I> metafile</I>, by calling
<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 FC -->GpiWCBitBlt</A>.
<P>
Metafiles are covered in detail later.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Use the IBM OS/2 file-handling functions, in conjunction
with<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 57 --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A> and<A><!-- external link: 1D 24 C4 FC --> GpiSetBitmapBits</A>.

<P>
An application can save a bit map in a file by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 FC --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A>,
DosOpen, DosWrite, and DosClose.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 57 -->GpiQueryBitmapBits</A> copies bit-map
data from a memory device context (that has a standard-format bit map selected
into it) to a buffer. The bit map you copy can be newly created or have
been loaded from a resource file.
<P>
You must supply the address in application storage of a<I> bit-map information
table</I>. The bit-map information table has the same structure as the bit
map information header, except for an additional entry, the colors field.
As input to<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 FC --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A>,
you supply a bit-count value and a plane value. These must both be standard
bit-map format values, so the plane value is always 1, and the bit-count
value is 1, 4, 8, or 24. If any conversion of the bit-map data is necessary,
it is done automatically. You also must provide the address of the application
storage into which the bit-map data is to be loaded. You probably will need
to find out how large the bit map is before you can do this.<A><!-- external link: 1D BF C3 58 --> GpiQueryBitmapParameters
</A>returns the width, height, plane count, and bit count of a named bit
map.
<P>
You also must supply the size of the fixed portion of the header (as well
as bit count, and so on). Nonstandard formats supported by the device that
owns the bit map will also be valid for<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 FC --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A>.

<P>
You must ensure that you allocate sufficient storage at the end of the bit
map information table for the returned color table which, if the number
of planes is 1, will have 2n entries, where n is the number of bits per
pel.
<P>
On return from<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 FC --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A>,
the system supplies the width, height, and bit-map color table in the bit-map
information table. You can retrieve a part of a bit map by specifying the
number of the scan line from which the transfer is to start, and the number
of scan lines you want.
<P>
When you have copied a bit map into application storage, you can save the
bit map externally, and reload it later, by using OS/2 file-handling functions.
After the application creates a file by calling DosOpen, it can call DosWrite
to copy the buffer containing the bit-map bits into the file. The application
then closes the file by calling DosClose.
<P>
If an application needs to use a bit map it has stored on disk, it can copy
the file's contents into a buffer by calling DosRead, and then copy information
about the image to the bit map by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 24 C4 FC --> GpiSetBitmapBits</A>.
The application must select the bit map into a memory device context before
it sets the bits. As with<A><!-- external link: 1D BB C3 FC --> GpiQueryBitmapBits</A>,
you can transfer a part of the bit map rather than the whole.<A><!-- external link: 1D 24 C4 59 --> GpiSetBitmapBits
</A>can be used to transfer standard-format bit maps only, and only to a
bit map selected into a memory device context. If necessary, bit-map data
is automatically converted from one standard format to another. Nonstandard
formats supported by the device owning the bit map will also be valid for
<A><!-- external link: 1D 24 C4 FC -->GpiSetBitmapBits</A>.
<P>
If an application creates bit maps another application might use, it should
create them by using the standard IBM OS/2 bit-map file format.
