<H1>Palette Manager</H1><!-- entering slot 1188 -->
<P>
Applications can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C3 39 --> GpiCreatePalette
</A>to change the physical color palette by creating a new palette. This
function is used if the application has specific color needs and must ensure
that the color is part of the physical color palette.<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C3 39 --> GpiCreatePalette
</A>also enables an application to prevent<I> dithering</I> of the 16 default
colors by setting the flag parameter to LCOL_PURECOLOR. If the full 256
colors in the palette are needed, the application can set the flag to LCOL_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_COLORS.
It is recommended that the palette manager functions be used only when really
necessary because the operating system cannot guarantee consistent colors
in other windows and the ability to change the physical palette is device
dependent.
<P>
After the palette is created, an application can set or change any of the
values in the palette by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 4C C4 FC --> GpiSetPaletteEntries</A>.
To delete the palette, applications use<A><!-- external link: 1D 7E C3 FC --> GpiDeletePalette</A>,
passing the handle of the palette to be deleted. (The handle is returned
by<A><!-- external link: 1D 76 C3 39 --> GpiCreatePalette</A> when the palette
is created.)
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D FA C3 3B -->GpiQueryPalette</A> enables applications
to determine the palette currently selected for a given presentation space.
A palette can be used by more than one presentation space at the same time.
The operating system maintains a count of the number of presentation spaces
using a specific palette. Complete information on the current palette can
be accessed by<A><!-- external link: 1D FB C3 FC --> GpiQueryPaletteInfo</A>.

<P>
Palettes also can be shared by using a palette handle.
<P>
When coding an application, color table functions and color palette functions
must not be mixed. The application can call DevQueryCaps to determine whether
the hardware supports palettes, then call the appropriate functions.
