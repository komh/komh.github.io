<H1>Transferring Bit Maps</H1><!-- entering slot 1090 -->
<P>
The three remaining bit-map drawing functions operate in very similar ways.
<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 27 -->GpiDrawBits</A> copies a bit-map image
from application memory to a device or a device context.<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 26 --> GpiBitBlt
</A>directs bit maps to devices other than the screen.<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 28 --> GpiWCBitBlt
</A>enables you to retain the bit-map data in the segment store of the target
presentation space.
<P>
The similarities are discussed first. Their differences are discussed in
the sections that follow.
<P>
An application should use<A><!-- external link: 1D 84 C3 FC --> GpiDrawBits</A>,
<A><!-- external link: 1D 62 C3 FC -->GpiBitBlt</A>, or<A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C4 28 --> GpiWCBitBlt
</A>to draw bit maps that use a color table or <A HREF="369_L2_RGB2.html">RGB2
</A>structures color formats of 1, 4, 8, or 24 bits per pel.
<P>
An application can draw inverted bit maps for any of these three functions
by calling the function and passing ROP_NOTSRCCOPY as the raster operation.
