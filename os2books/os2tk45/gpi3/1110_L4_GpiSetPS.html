<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 53 C4 28 -->GpiSetPS</A> redefines the size and
format of the presentation page. The processing performed when you call
<A><!-- external link: 1D 53 C4 28 -->GpiSetPS</A> is similar to that performed
by<A><!-- external link: 1D 77 C3 FC --> GpiCreatePS</A>, except that the
presentation space already exists. The presentation space is returned to
a neutral state (which is the equivalent of requesting GRES_ALL using<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 FC --> GpiResetPS</A>),
and the presentation page is redefined. For example, you can change a presentation
page defined in 0.01mm units to one defined in pels. Essentially, this lets
you work with a new presentation space without having to delete one and
create another.
<P>
You also can use<A><!-- external link: 1D 53 C4 28 --> GpiSetPS</A> to change
the current mapping mode of a presentation space. To do this, use the PS_NORESET
flag, which is the equivalent of requesting GRES_SEGMENTS using<A><!-- external link: 1D 17 C4 FC --> GpiResetPS</A>.
This feature is particularly useful if you are designing an application
that deals with page layout and drafting, or if you want the screen size
to correspond to the page size for the printed output.
