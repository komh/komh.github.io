<P>
Graphics text, like all other graphics objects, has to be positioned correctly
in the output area, which usually consists of one of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Entire client area of a PM window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Part of a PM window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Addressable area of a printer<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Unlike other graphics objects, however, text is governed by well-established
readability and usability rules. These rules apply generally to text output,
whatever its method of production. Following are some recommendations:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Lines of text from fonts with large point sizes must
be more widely spaced for maximum readability.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The longer the line of text, the greater the space
between lines must be to ensure that the lines do not appear to merge.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Very small text must be split into multiple columns
rather than continued across the page.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Some of these considerations are taken care of by the font designer. The
PM enables you to control both the horizontal and vertical positioning of
text.
