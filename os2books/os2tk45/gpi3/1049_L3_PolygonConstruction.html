<H1>Polygon Construction</H1><!-- entering slot 1069 -->
<P>
An application specifies the area construction when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> GpiBeginArea</A>.
There are two options:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_ALTERNATE (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->POLYGON_WINDING.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
As with area construction, in alternate mode:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A point is included in the filled polygon if you have
to cross an odd number of lines in the set of polygons when drawing a line
from that point to infinity.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A point is not included in the filled polygon if you
have to cross an even number of lines in the set of polygons when drawing
a line from that point to infinity.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Also as with area construction, in winding mode, the direction in which
the boundary lines of the polygons are drawn determines whether a given
point is included in the filled polygon. Since the individual polygons drawn
with<A><!-- external link: 1D AD C3 2A --> GpiPolygons</A> are generated
by independent structures, the direction in which a polygon is drawn depends
only on the vertices of that polygon.
<P>
To determine if a given point is included in the filled polygon, count the
number of lines to be crossed to move from that point to infinity. For each
boundary line drawn in one direction add one to the tally. For each line
drawn in the opposite direction, subtract one from the tally. A point is
within the polygon if the result is nonzero.
