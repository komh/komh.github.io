<H1>Draw Mode</H1><!-- entering slot 1112 -->
<P>
In<I> draw mode</I>, graphics output is provided immediately to the currently
associated device and is not retained in a segment store.  When the graphics
have been drawn, they cannot be used again unless they are re-created. For
example, when a window containing draw mode graphics is moved or sized,
the graphics have to be re-created by the application.
<P>
Draw mode graphics are suitable if an application is creating fairly simple
graphics quickly or is maintaining its own graphics database.  In the latter
case, there is nothing to gain by retaining graphics.
<P>
A segment created when the drawing mode is DM_DRAW, is called a<I> nonretained
segment</I>. While it might sound contradictory, nonretained segments have
certain advantages that are described in <A HREF="1111_L3_NonretainedGraphicSe.html">Nonretained
Graphic Segments</A>.
