<H1>How Clipping Is Implemented</H1><!-- entering slot 1165 -->
<P>
The rules by which the PM implements clipping are as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any primitive completely outside the clipping boundary
is discarded.
<P>
When a primitive crosses a clipping boundary, any part outside the boundary
is discarded.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Any primitive completely within the clipping boundary
is retained.
<P>
When a primitive crosses a clipping boundary, any part within the boundary
is retained.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the clipping boundary is a clip path, viewing
window, or graphics field, any point that falls on the boundary is considered
within the clipping boundary.
<P>
When the clipping boundary is a clipping region, any point on the top or
right boundaries of a rectangle is discarded; and any point on the bottom
or left boundaries of a rectangle, that is not on the right or top boundaries
also, is included in the region.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
