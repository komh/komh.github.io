<P>
Applications can use bit maps to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Store and display scanned images, icons, and symbols
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>

<P>
An application can display a bit-map image on any<I> raster</I> output device.
A raster is a rectangular matrix of pels on a video display or dot matrix
printer. A raster output device displays an image by setting pels in its
matrix to colors specified in a corresponding bit map. An image created
in this way is called a "bit-map image". Bit maps cannot be sent to vector
output devices such as plotters.
<P>
A bit map is drawn to an output device row by row. Each horizontal line
of pels is known as a<I> scan line</I>.
<P>
There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the number of rows of pels in a
bit-map image and the rows of bits in a bit map. The first pel in a bit-map
image is in the lower-left corner, and the last pel is in the upper-right
corner. The pels are in left-to-right order inside each row of the image.
The following figure shows this relationship between bit map and image.

Bits and Pels in a Bit-Map Image
<P>

<P>
When an application creates a bit map by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> GpiCreateBitmap</A>,
it specifies the bit-map width and height in terms of pels in the bit-map
image. The width is the number of pels within a row; the height is the number
of rows. The application must store these dimensions in the <A HREF="021_L2_BITMAPINFO2.html">BITMAPINFO2
</A>and <A HREF="042_L2_BITMAPINFOHEADER.html">BITMAPINFOHEADER</A> and
pass their addresses to<A><!-- external link: 1D 73 C3 FC --> GpiCreateBitmap</A>.
