<H1>Color on Advanced Display Devices</H1><!-- entering slot 1201 -->
<P>
Some devices can display simultaneously a fixed number of colors (typically
156), chosen from a much larger number of colors (often more than 256000).
An application can use the palette manager functions to take advantage of
the extra capabilities of these devices. These functions enable an application
to change the colors in a device's physical color table and the displayed
colors rapidly without explicitly redrawing the screen.
<P>
An application can use the CAPS_ADDITIONAL_GRAPHICS option of DevQueryCaps
to determine whether the display device supports palette functions.
