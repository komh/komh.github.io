<H1>The Graphics Field</H1><!-- entering slot 1163 -->
<P>
The graphics field defines a rectangular clipping area in the presentation
page. It is defined in<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C4 FC --> GpiSetGraphicsField</A>.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If this clipping area is to be used, it must be defined before
any drawing begins.
<P>
Specify the size of the graphics field in presentation page coordinates
as input to<A><!-- external link: 1D 3E C4 FC --> GpiSetGraphicsField</A>.

<P>
Only the graphic output contained in this clipping boundary is visible when
the presentation page is transformed to device space. By default, the graphics
field is infinitely large and therefore performs no clipping. If you do
specify a graphics field, however, any point on its boundary is considered
within the graphics field and is not clipped. When a drawing primitive,
such as a line, intersects a graphic field, any part of the line outside
the graphics field is clipped. The following figure shows how a graphics
field could be defined for a presentation page.

The Graphics Field
<P>
The broken line shows an arbitrary graphics field that is smaller than the
presentation page. The aircraft tail, a separate object in the presentation
page, is outside the graphics field and is clipped away as it is drawn.

<P>

<P>
The picture assembled in the graphics field is the picture that is displayed
or printed. If you do not define a graphics field, the picture assembled
in the presentation page is the picture that is displayed or printed. The
presentation page is not a clipping boundary, and graphics in page coordinate
space that are outside the presentation page boundary, therefore, might
be visible.
