<P>
In<I> retain mode</I>, graphics are retained in the segment store only.
They are not directed to the current device as they are created.
<P>
In retain mode, the presentation space does not have to be associated with
a device context when graphics are being defined. It is possible to define
graphics and store their definitions without sending them to a display screen
or printer. The concept of<I> attribute currentness</I>, however, is relevant
only when you are drawing graphics to an output device. For example, the
color or other attribute that is current when you define a primitive is
the color in which the line is drawn. That color or other attribute might
not be the color that is current when you you actually draw the primitive.
This is described in <A HREF="1046_L3_AttributeCurrentness.html">Attribute
Currentness</A>.
<P>
Many of the GPI queries that return current attribute values are invalid
in retain mode because current attribute values have no effect when graphics
are not sent to an output device.
