<P>
The<I> fast-chained attribute</I> applies only to chained segments. It prevents
primitive attributes from being reset to their default values at the beginning
of the segment, an aid to performance. There is unnecessary overhead in
resetting attributes to their defaults if either of the following is true:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You are going to change the default values of the
attributes at the start of the segment.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->You know that attributes have not been altered previously
from their default values.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The fast-chained attribute is switched ON by default, and you should leave
it on unless you specifically want attributes to be set to their default
values. To turn off the fast-chained attribute, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 3F C4 21 --> GpiSetInitialSegmentAttrs
