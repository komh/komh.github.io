<H1>Color Planes</H1><!-- entering slot 1085 -->
<P>
Bit maps are arranged in one or more<I> color planes</I>. A color plane
is an array of bit-map bits that contains color information.
<P>
The bit maps in each of the previous illustrations use the single<I> bit-map
plane</I> format, which is the standard format for bit maps in OS/2 applications.
In this format, a specified number of adjacent bit-map bits contains indexes
to either a special color table of RGB values or actual <A HREF="369_L2_RGB2.html">RGB2
</A>structures. Whether the application maps bits into an RGB or <A HREF="369_L2_RGB2.html">RGB2
</A>structure depends on the bit-map format. All of the color information
resides in a single plane.
<P>
The second color format uses more than one color plane. A common multiplane
bit-map format is the three-plane format, in which one plane corresponds
to the red pels, another to the green pels, and a third to the blue pels.
Multiplane bit-map formats are rare in PM applications. Most bit maps are
stored externally in a single-plane format, although the device driver (such
as VGA) may internally convert them to the multiplane format.
<P>
The single-plane format can be converted internally to any multiplane format
used by a device. You also can use a nonstandard number of bits to describe
each pel, if supported by your output device. If you write your own presentation
driver, it must be able to convert the standard bit-map formats to its own
internal format.
<P>
An application can determine which color-plane format a device supports
by calling<A><!-- external link: 1D D9 C3 FC --> GpiQueryDeviceBitmapFormats</A>.
