<P>
When you create a presentation space, the drawing mode is set to draw. Your
application can change this mode using<A><!-- external link: 1D 3A C4 FC --> GpiSetDrawingMode</A>.
The two additional drawing modes provided by the PM are<I> retain</I> (DM_RETAIN)
and<I> draw-and-retain</I> (DM_DRAWANDRETAIN). Your application can determine
which drawing mode is set by using<A><!-- external link: 1D DB C3 FC --> GpiQueryDrawingMode</A>.

<P>
The drawing mode that you select becomes current for the presentation space,
and it can be changed any number of times. Select the appropriate drawing
mode before creating a segment. The drawing mode affects the segment type.
