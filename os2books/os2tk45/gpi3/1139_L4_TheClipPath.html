<H1>The Clip Path</H1><!-- entering slot 1161 -->
<P>
The<I> clip path</I> defines the clipping boundary in world coordinate space.
Paths are graphic objects that serve many purposes, only one of which is
to be used as a clipping mechanism. Paths are described in<A><!-- external link: 1D 5B C6 FC --> Paths</A>.
The recommended functional sequence for creating a clip path is as follows:
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Function<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Effect<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 61 C3 5B --> GpiBeginPath
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Begins the path definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Line
and arc GPIs<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> Gives the path shape.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 8C C3 5C --> GpiEndPath
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Ends the path definition.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 5D --> GpiModifyPath
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>An optional step explained below.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F --> GpiSetClipPath
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL>Converts the path to a clip path.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Before converting to a clip path, the path can be modified using<A><!-- external link: 1D 9F C3 FC --> GpiModifyPath</A>.
If modified, the path is converted to a geometric (wide) line using the
current geometric width, line join, and line end attributes. The shape defined
by the geometric line then is used for the clip path. The clip path can
be a simple unmodified path.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F -->GpiSetClipPath</A> accepts two different
path identifiers as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->1SCP_RESET (default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>0SCP_AND
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The default path identifier, SCP_RESET, resets the clip path to infinity,
which displays the picture without clipping. If this value is selected,
the current clip path definition is discarded instead of stored.
<P>
A path identifier of SCP_AND specifies that the clip path be redefined as
the mathematical intersection of the stored clip path and the current path
definition.
<P>
The only method of specifying the clip path to the current path, after<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>has been called, is to call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>twice:  the first call with a path identifier of SCP_RESET, and the
second with a path identifier of SCP_AND.
<P>
The following figure shows a triangle shape that has been defined within
a path bracket and selected as the current clip path. The filled box shape
is drawn subsequently, and, therefore, is clipped to the triangle.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1139_L4_TheClipPath_36.gif" WIDTH=408 HEIGHT=352>
<P>
The Clipping Path
<P>
The broken lines show the area of the box that has been clipped.
<P>

<P>
Clip paths are most useful when you want to use an irregular clipping boundary,
or when the clipping boundary itself is an integral part of the picture.
Both are true of the clip path in the previous figure.
<P>
<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F -->GpiSetClipPath</A> also accepts one
of two construction options as input:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SCP_ALTERNATE (default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>SCP_WINDING
(must be selected if path has been modified).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any drawing that is clipped to the current clip path must follow the alternate
or the winding rules as to whether that portion of a picture is included
in the clip area. The alternate and winding modes are described for paths
in<A><!-- external link: 1D 5D C6 90 --> Paths in Alternate Mode</A> and
<A><!-- external link: 1D 5E C6 90 -->Paths in Winding Mode</A>. Any point
on the boundary of the path is considered within the path and is not clipped.

<P>
To end clipping to the current clip path, call<A><!-- external link: 1D 2F C4 5F --> GpiSetClipPath
</A>with an identifier of 0. This function deselects the current clip path
by setting it to infinity. In some circumstances, the current clip path
is deselected automatically.
<P>
A path definition can be stored in a graphics segment, and if that segment
is retained, the path can be re-created as required when the segment is
redrawn. Clip path definitions can be stored in a retained segment also
and redrawn when required. In<I> draw-and-retain</I> mode (DM_DRAWANDRETAIN),
the initial path or clip path is created as the segment is constructed.
If the current drawing mode is<I> retain</I> (DM_RETAIN), however, the path
or clip path is not created until the first time the segment is drawn.
