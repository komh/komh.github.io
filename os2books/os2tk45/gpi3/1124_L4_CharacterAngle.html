<H1>Character Angle</H1><!-- entering slot 1145 -->
<P>
The<I> character angle</I> is defined by the x-axis and a vector drawn through
the origin to a specified point in a Cartesian coordinate system. Neither
(0,0) nor the specified point need have any relation to the current position.
The operating system then aligns the baseline with this vector.
<P>
An application can retrieve the point that defines the character angle vector
using<A><!-- external link: 1D C1 C3 FC --> GpiQueryCharAngle</A>. An application
can set the character angle using<A><!-- external link: 1D 27 C4 FC --> GpiSetCharAngle</A>.
This function accepts as input the x- and y-coordinates of a point that
defines the new vector. When you specify an angle, it becomes the current
setting. To reset the character angle vector to its default value (parallel
to the x-axis), call<A><!-- external link: 1D 27 C4 3D --> GpiSetCharAngle
</A>with both<I> x</I> and<I> y</I> equal to 0.
<P>
The effects of the current character angle vary depending on the current
character mode and the current font type. When the current font is an outline
font, the current character angle determines the angle of both the whole
string and the individual characters in the string, regardless of the current
character mode. The baseline of each character cell is drawn parallel to
the new baseline, as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1124_L4_CharacterAngle_22.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>

The character string is drawn parallel to the vector drawn from the origin
to (10,7). The baseline of each of the character cells also is drawn parallel
to this vector.
<P>

<P>
The character angle value is ignored if the current font is an image font
and the current character mode is CM_MODE1, as shown in the following figure.

The angle of the character string is unaltered by<A><!-- external link: 1D 27 C4 FC --> GpiSetCharAngle</A>.

<P>

<P>
When the current font is an image font and the current character mode is
CM_MODE2, the current character angle determines the angle of the whole
string but does not affect the individual characters in the string. The
<I>character reference point</I>, which is the point at which the character
baseline intersects the left edge of the character cell, is placed on a
line parallel to the new baseline. The baseline of each character cell remains
parallel to the x-axis, as shown in the following figure.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="1124_L4_CharacterAngle_24.gif" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=436>

<P>
The character string is drawn parallel to the vector from (0,0) to (10,7).

<P>
Each of the characters in the string in the previous figure is drawn with
the vertical sides of its character cell parallel to the y-axis, and with
the horizontal sides of its character box parallel to the x-axis.
