<H1>Area Boundaries</H1><!-- entering slot 1062 -->
<P>
An application specifies the<I> area boundary</I> when it calls<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> GpiBeginArea</A>.
There are two options:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BA_BOUNDARY (the default)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->BA_NOBOUNDARY.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The BA_BOUNDARY value tells the programming interface to draw all outlines
of the area primitives within the area bracket, using a line that conforms
to the current LINEBUNDLE attributes. If the line attributes have not been
changed, the default outline color is black on most displays and printers,
and the default line style is solid. An application can change the line
color and line styles within the area bracket. The interior of the area
primitive is filled with the current pattern.
<P>
To prevent the interface from outlining an area, an application can use
the BA_NOBOUNDARY flag when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> GpiBeginArea</A>.
Only the interior fill pattern is visible. This value most often is used
when an area contains many overlapping figures, and the interior lines are
not desired.
<P>
You could think of this option in terms similar to the outline and fill
options discussed with boxes and full arcs. The BA_BOUNDARY value corresponds
to DRO_OUTLINEFILL, and BA_NOBOUNDARY, to DRO_FILL. There is no distinct
boundary value that corresponds to DRO_OUTLINE, the simple outline. To simulate
this effect, OR the BA_NOBOUNDARY value with the appropriate area construction
value when calling<A><!-- external link: 1D 5F C3 FC --> GpiBeginArea</A>.
