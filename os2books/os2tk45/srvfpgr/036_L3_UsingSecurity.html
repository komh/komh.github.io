<P>
The RPC runtime caches call-related information so subsequent calls are
be faster than the first.  This cached call information is keyed by the
identity associated with the binding, so if you change the authority information
on the binding, the cached call is not reused for the next call.  If your
application switches back and forth between a few identities, you can improve
performance by keeping a separate binding for each identity, instead of
resetting the same binding.
<P>
For the same reason you want to conserve the identities that you use.  Delegation
creates new identities.  These identities are several KBs in size and are
cached for about a minute.  The rate at which your application creates identities
determines how many, on average, are in the cache.
