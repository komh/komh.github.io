<H1>Naming Conventions</H1><!-- entering slot 22 -->
<P>
Naming conventions for the ASCIIZ strings used with LAN Server APIs depend
on the type of name.  For instance, server or resource names follow different
rules than the names for users or groups.
<P>
A server is named during the installation of the LAN Server code, where
the name is placed in the IBMLAN.INI file in the<I> computername</I> parameter.
 Subsequently, an application always must refer to that server by that name,
preceded by a double backslash (\\).
<P>
Any shared resource can be named according to the universal naming convention
(UNC). A UNC name consists of a double backslash, the name of the server,
another backslash, and the name of the resource: \\<I>servername</I>\<I>netname</I>.

<P>
Any shared resource (or portion of a UNC name) can be assigned an alias
name of up to 8 bytes. Once assigned an alias, a resource can be addressed
simply by the name of the alias, regardless of the server to which the resource
is connected.
<P>
On HPFS partitions, LAN Server supports directory names of up to 260 bytes,
including:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The drive letter<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A colon (:)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->All characters in the directory path, including backslashes
(\) and slashes (/)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The file or directory name on the end of the path
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The null character at the end of the ASCIIZ string
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
For file allocation table (FAT) disk partitions and all DLS requesters,
file names can be up to 8 bytes long; extensions, up to 3 bytes; individual
path names, up to 63 bytes; and a fully designated path name, up to 128
bytes.
<P>
Other naming restrictions for OS/2 requesters and servers include the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->User or group IDs can contain up to 20 bytes, not
including the null character at the end of the string.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Passwords can be up to 14 bytes, not counting the
null character at the end.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Requester, server, and domain names can be up to 15
bytes each, not counting the null character at the end.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->User and group IDs, passwords, workstation names,
and domain names cannot use the following characters:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->ASCII characters less than hexadecimal 21<!-- lm: 0x2 8 --> -<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>Any
of the following:
<PRE>" / \ [ ] : | &lt; &gt; + =
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>Periods
(.) can be used; however, a period cannot be used as the first character
in a network name, nor can 2 periods be used adjacently. For instance, .work.sta.1
and work..sta.1 are not valid, because of the placement of the periods.
 The name work.sta.1 is valid.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
