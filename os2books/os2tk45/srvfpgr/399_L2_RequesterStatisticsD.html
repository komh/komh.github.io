NCBs. These numbers are held as follows in the<I> fcNCB</I> fields:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->

<UL>The
following 12 fields form six quadwords, which contain very large counters.
The high doubleword of each is the value divided by 2[32], while the low
doubleword is the value modulo 2[32]. A quadword is a data area that is
twice as large as a doubleword.
<P>
These fields count total bytes in all NCBs sent and received for all three
categories: issued, failed issue, and failed completion. Server information
is included to provide an accurate total.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For all the NCB-related and bytes-count counters:
<P>
Those with the suffix<I> _r</I> are from the redirector. These NCBs are
issued by the redirector as part of the normal process of maintaining remote
network connections.
<P>
Those with the suffix<I> _s</I> are server-related. These NCBs are sent
by the redirector on behalf of the server to maintain shared resource connections.

<P>
Those with the suffix<I> _a</I> are application-generated. These NCBs can
be caused by applications calling NetBiosSubmit, the use of second-class
mailslots, server announcements (sending and receiving), and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 --><I>bytessent_r_hi</I> is the number of requester

</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>reqbufneed
</I>is the number of times the requester required a request buffer but failed
to allocate one. This indicates that the parameters of the requester might
need adjustment.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>bigbufneed
</I>is the number of times the requester required a big buffer but failed
to allocate one. This indicates that the parameters of the requester might
need adjustment.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> A value of -1 or 0xFFFFFFFF for any field means that information
is not available. A value of -2 or 0xFFFFFFFE means that the field has overflowed.
