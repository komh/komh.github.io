OS/2 LAN Server provides a rich set of application programming interfaces
(APIs), where each API provides a particular function upon request from
an application.  By calling upon a combination of APIs, your application
can use nearly all of the OS/2 operating system and LAN Server functions
 with your other applications, from file reads and writes through interprocess
communication (IPC).  In addition, your applications can take full advantage
of true multitasking and can be integrated fully into the OS/2 desktop.

<P>
Most LAN Server API calls can be issued either locally (to an API on the
same workstation where the application resides) or remotely (to another
server or peer workstation).  Hence, your applications can use local functions
as well as LAN-wide functions.
<P>
Programmable functions include those for LAN Server itself, OS/2 LAN Requester,
and DOS LAN Services (DLS).  These functions are accessible to OS/2 or DLS
applications, although DOS has some limitations.  Any such limitations are
included in either the Restrictions or DOS Considerations section of an
API's description.

Programming for Directory and Security Server (DSS) is similar to programming
for LAN Server.  Most LAN Server APIs are unchanged in DSS.  APIs relating
to security and resources have been mapped to use the services provided
by Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).  This allows existing applications
to function unchanged on DSS and lets you build on your existing code base.

and clients is limited.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
