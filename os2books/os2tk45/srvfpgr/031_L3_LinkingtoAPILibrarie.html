<H1>Linking to API Libraries for DLS</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
An OS/2 program uses dynamic link libraries during run time, where some
of the functions are called like subroutines, allowing more function with
fewer memory requirements.  Although DOS does not use dynamic link libraries,
Microsoft Windows 3.1 does.
<P>
LAN Server provides dynamic link libraries, NETAPI.DLL and PMSPL.DLL, for
use with Windows 3.1.  In order to call LAN Server APIs, a Windows application
must link to the NETAPI.LIB and PMSPL.LIB (for DosPrint API support) libraries.

<P>
Link a DOS application to the DOSNET.LIB library.  This library file provides
the network functions for applications on DLS workstations to access LAN
Server.
<P>
Link your application to these .LIB files during compile with a compiler
such as Microsoft C Version 6.0 or later, Microsoft C/C++ Version 7.0 or
later, or Microsoft Visual C++ Professional Edition Version 1.5 or later
(which supports the LAN Server DOSNET.LIB library for DLS applications),
Borland C/C++ Version 4.0 or later.
<P>
Depending on the compiler and your options, the command to link a DOS application
to the API libraries might resemble this:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For non-Windows, DLS (DOS) applications:
<PRE>LINK MYDOSAPP.OBJ, MYDOSAPP.EXE, MYDOSAPP.MAP,
<I>d</I>:DOSNET.LIB
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For Windows applications:
<PRE>LINK MYWINAPP.OBJ, MYWINAPP.EXE, MYWINAPP.MAP,
<I>d</I>:NETAPI.LIB
<I>d</I>:PMSPL.LIB
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
where<I> d:</I> includes the drive and directory path for the .LIB file.
 The DOSNET.LIB, NETAPI.LIB, and PMSPL.LIB. libraries are located by default
in the \NET directory on the workstation.  If you have remote IPL support
on a server, the library files are stored by default in the \IBMLAN\DOSLAN\NET
subdirectory of that server. (Refer to the documentation accompanying your
compiler for instructions and options.)
