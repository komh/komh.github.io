<H1>Differences in API Functions for DOS</H1><!-- entering slot 648 -->
<P>
DOS LAN Services (DLS) supports a subset of the API functions supported
by an OS/2 workstation.  Most of the DOS LAN Services API functions are
processed on a remote server.  API functions that can be processed remotely
must include a remote server name parameter to identify where the function
is to be run.  Attempting to run a remote-only function on a local requester
returns NERR_RemoteOnly.
<P>
Those functions that can be processed on a local requester must be called
with either a NULL server name parameter (defaults to local requester name)
or the name assigned the local requester in the format of<I> computername</I>.
 Attempting to run a local-only function on a remote server returns ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.

<P>
The following sections describe the differences between a call from a DLS
and an OS/2 workstation.
