<H1>Directory Limits Information Data Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 251 -->
<P>
This data structure is defined in the DASD.H header file and is used with
these APIs:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->NetDASDAdd<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->NetDASDEnum<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->NetDASDSetInfo<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>struct dasd_info_0 {       unsigned char LSFAR * LSPTR    d0_resource_name;
       unsigned long                  d0_max;

where:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>d0_resource_name</I> points to the name of the
directory upon which the API is to act. The directory name is specified
as a standard OS/2 directory path, beginning with the drive letter and ending
without the backslash (\). For the NetDASDAdd and NetDASDSet APIs, the path
specified by this<I> d0_resource_name</I> field can be on a redirected drive.
 If so, the<I> pszServername</I> parameter submitted with the NetDASDAdd
or NetDASDSet call must be NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> d0_max</I> field contains the amount of disk
space allotted to this directory by directory limits. Specified in KB, this
field can be set from 1 to 67108863.  Note however, that subsequent access
to this directory is functionally limited to the smaller of the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->Any directory limits restrictions on any parent directory
<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The total free space on the drive<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
</UL> If
the NetDASDGetInfo API returns a value of 0 to the<I> d0_max</I> field in
this data structure, the specified directory (and any parent directory)
does not have directory limits set.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>d0_use
</I>is the amount (in KB) of disk space already occupied within the specified
directory resource.  This field is ignored for ADD or SET operations.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>The
<I>d0_flag</I> field can take one of the following values:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DASD_VALIDATE_LIMIT_ON, which compares a newly specified
limit (<I>d0_max</I> field) to the amount of disk space already taken by
the directory.  If the directory tree size exceeds the new limit, NERR_MaxValidationFailed
is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DASD_VALIDATE_LIMIT_OFF, which sets the new limit
regardless of the present size of the directory tree.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>d0_thresh
</I>specifies the initial alert threshold as a percentage of the total directory
limit space allotted, with values ranging from 0 to 99.  Zero specifies
that no threshold alert is to be generated, and 99 specifies that an alert
is generated when 99% of the allotted directory limit for this directory
has been reached. Note that a minimum of 1KB of disk space must be allotted
to a threshold; the value obtained by multiplying the<I> d0_thresh</I> decimal-point
value (where 5% = 0.05) by<I> d0_max</I> must be at least 1KB.
<P>
This threshold setting generates only 1 alert when this boundary is crossed.
 Subsequent alerts (generated incrementally after this threshold has been
reached but before the entire limit is reached) are specified according
to the next field,<I> d0_delta</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL><I>d0_delta
</I>specifies the increment in which alerts are to be generated after the
<I>d0_thresh</I> threshold has been crossed but before all of the allotted
disk space has been used. This field also is specified as a percentage of
the total allotted directory limit space and can range from 0 upward, as
long as its value is less than 99 -<I> d0_thresh</I>. Note that a minimum
of 1KB of disk space must be allotted to an increment; the value obtained
by multiplying the<I> d0_delta</I> decimal-point value (where 5% = 0.05)
by<I> d0_max</I> must be at least 1KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
