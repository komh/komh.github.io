<H1>Services Provided with LAN Server</H1><!-- entering slot 459 -->
<P>
With user authority, your application can call all of the following services
locally.  With administrative authority, your application can call them
remotely, as well.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Alerter<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Generates an alert notification whenever
a system event occurs, determines which requesters are registered to receive
notifications about events in the same class, and sends the notification
to those requesters.
<P>
The Alerter service registers itself to receive all print, error-log, and
administrative alerts.  It creates and registers a mail slot to receive
alerts triggered by these events.  When it receives an alert, the Alerter
service converts the information to text and sends an event notification
by calling the NetMessageBufferSend API.
<P>
The Alerter service sends alert notifications about an individual print
job only to the user who submitted the job.  It sends administrative and
error-log alert notifications to all users listed in the<I> sv2_alerts</I> field
of the<I> server_info_2</I> data structure.  A list of these users can be
retrieved by calling the NetServerGetInfo API.
<P>
You can set up thresholds for various server parameters in the IBMLAN.INI
file to determine when an alert is generated. You also can specify in the
IBMLAN.INI file where the alerts should be sent.
<P>
To interface your application with this service, use the APIs in the Service
and Alert Categories.
<P>
For more information about alert functions, see <A HREF="069_L1_AlertCategory.html">Alert
Category</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DCDB Replicator<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Replicates
the \IBMLAN\DCDB subdirectory (except remote IPL images) from a domain controller
to other servers defined as backup domain controllers.  When used with the
Netlogon service, the DCDB Replicator service ensures that users always
can log on to a domain, even if the domain controller fails or is busy.
 The DCDB Replicator service is separate from the Replicator service, and
both can reside and function independently of each other on the domain controller
or backup domain controllers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Generic Alerter (Genalert)
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Enables the server to build and send Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) alerts.  The Generic Alerter service is notified by the
Alerter service when certain LAN alerts occur. The Generic Alerter service
then uses the FFST/2 program to build software generic alerts that conform
to the SNA format and sends them either to the NetView program or to IBM
LAN Network Manager using the FFST/2 router.  The Generic Alerter service
can be started only if the FFST/2 program is running.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> LSserver
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Provides DOS LAN Services support and logical server
functions.  The logical server supports remote requests from requesters
for activities such as spooling, querying users, logon, and logoff.  The
LSserver service is started and stopped by the Server service. Increase
the default value of 3 for the<I> srvpipes</I> parameter in the IBMLAN.INI
file only if the administrator is detecting unusually long logon times,
printing responses, and so on.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Messenger<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Enables
users to (1) send and receive messages, (2) save messages in the log file,
(3) add and delete messaging names, and (4) forward messages to another
requester. The Messenger service does all these things by calling the Message
category functions (see <A HREF="215_L1_MessageCategory.html">Message Category</A>).
 The Messenger service receives messages sent from remote workstations by
way of the NetMessageBufferSend or NetMessageFileSend APIs.  For more details,
see the<I> LAN Server Network Administrator Reference Volume 2:<!-- entering slot 460 --> Performance
Tuning</I>.
<P>
To interface your application with this service, use the APIs in the Service
and Messaging Categories.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Netlogon<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Allows
servers in a domain to receive updated copies of the user and group definitions
file (NET.ACC), which is maintained on the domain controller.  Enables domain
controllers and additional servers that function as a domain controller
backup to satisfy logon requests. Controls (1) the length of time a user
can be logged on to the network, (2) the password expiration time, and (3)
number of user passwords that must be unique. The Server service must be
started before the Netlogon service can be started.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Netrun
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Supports the remote execution of programs.  If
the Netrun service is paused, requests to run a program remotely are denied.
When the Netrun service is removed, each process started by the server is
ended by the OS/2 DosKillProc API.  The Server service must be started before
the Netrun service can be started.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Peer<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Gives
a requester (called a peer server) some of the capabilities of a server,
allowing the owner to share directories, named pipes, one printer queue,
and one communication device queue with other users on the network.  It
lets one user at a time connect to the peer server.
<P>
Peer workstations are not started from the domain.  They are administered
by the owner of the peer workstation, rather than the network administrator,
who has no control over the resources at a peer workstation.
<P>
Because peer workstations are not part of the domain, they can be administered
only from the command line and do not support alias names.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Remote
Initial Program Load (Remoteboot)<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Enables the Server
service to support remote IPL of DOS and OS/2 requesters, including requesters
without local media (CD-ROM, hard disk, or diskette drives).
<P>
To interface your application with this service, use the APIs in the Service
and RIPL Categories.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Replicator<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Provides
file replication service. It copies files from a master location on a server
to one or more servers or requesters requiring a copy of the data so that
an information base can be maintained simultaneously on two or more workstations.
 The server sending the data is called the<I> exporter</I>.  The requesters
or servers receiving the data are called<I> importers</I>.  This service
cannot be paused.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Requester<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Maintains
most internal information and activates the network device drivers.  If
the Requester service is paused, no redirection can be established to files,
printers, or serial devices.  The Requester service enables a workstation
to use local area network resources and services.  The Requester service
must be running for any other LAN Server service to run, and it cannot be
removed while the Server service is started.
<P>
To interface your application with this service, use the APIs in the Service
and Requester Categories.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Server<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Provides
the basic function needed to share local resources over the network.  If
the Server service is paused, all further requests for resources are denied.
 However, all current uses of shared resources continue.
<P>
Users with administrative authority are allowed to connect to the server
even when it is paused.  This allows the server to be managed remotely by
an administrator. To interface your application with this service, use the
APIs in the Server and Service Categories.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Timesource
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Designates a server with a reliable time and date
with which other workstations in the same domain or other domains can synchronize.
Timesource does not keep time.  It only provides the means for other workstations
on the network to identify a server with a reliable clock.  The keeping
of a reliable clock is external to this service.
<P>
An additional server can be designated a Timesource server by starting the
Timesource service from the command line or by updating IBMLAN.INI to<!-- entering slot 461 --> add
Timesource to the SRVSERVICES statement.  Multiple Timesource servers can
exist on a network; it is the responsibility of the requesting application
to determine with which Timesource server it will synchronize.  OS/2 LAN
Requester and LAN Server do not use the Timesource support; they always
synchronize with the domain controller.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Uninterruptible
Power Supply (UPS)<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Provides protection against
loss of data during power failures. When a power interruption occurs at
a server, users who have active sessions with the affected server are notified
of an impending shutdown.  They have the opportunity to save and close open
files on their workstation before the server shuts down.  The UPS service
then stops all services and writes all data in cache memory to permanent
storage.  The service cannot be paused or continued.
<P>
Servers must have an uninterruptible power supply, such as a battery, connected
to a dedicated serial port.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
