<P>
OS/2 LAN Server access security is used to assign, verify, and enforce access
to resources for each user or group ID.  (Access privileges must be granted
by a user with administrative authority.)
<P>
Many APIs have access restrictions and require administrative authority
to be invoked.  These types of APIs usually retrieve or set sensitive data
or control key network services.  Specific access requirements are specified
under the Restrictions section of each API described in this book. LAN Server
provides the following types of access protection at the API level:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Administrative privilege level, which includes full
access<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Various access privilege levels for remote API function
calls<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Various access privilege levels for local API function
calls if Local Security is installed<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Most of the APIs can be run on local or remote workstations, provided that
the required software services are running. Access restrictions are not
enforced for local calls to LAN Server APIs unless Local Security is installed
on the server.
<P>
The LAN Server access control subsystem (ACS) controls the domain-wide access
of resources by users and groups. LAN Server maintains users, groups, and
resource access controls in a user accounts subsystem (UAS) database.
