<H1>About This Book</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
This reference book provides programmers with descriptions of the application
programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the IBM Operating System/2 for
OS/2 Warp Servers, LAN Servers, and the Directory and Security Server. These
APIs provide the functional interface for server and client application
development.
<P>
The OS/2 operating system referred to in this book is OS/2 Versions 2.1
through OS/2 Warp 4 (with the applicable CSDs and ServicePaks applied).

<P>
This book also provides the OS/2 Warp Connect LAN Requester APIs.  These
APIs are 32-bit and are generally consistent with the Net32xxx and Dos32xxx
LAN APIs that ship with LAN Server 4.0.
<P>
DOS refers to DOS versions 3.3, 5.0, 6.x, or 7.0.
