<P>
Mailslot APIs provide one-way interprocess communication (IPC). They are
used with the MAILSLOT.H and NETCONS.H header files.
<P>
Through LAN Server mailslots, data can be sent to either local or remote
applications on the network. Calls to these APIs must, however, be issued
locally. The Mailslot functions create and delete mailslots, retrieve information
about a mailslot or a message in it, and write messages to mailslots.
<P>
Mailslots can be read or deleted only by the process that created them.
Mailslots created by a process are deleted when that process ends.
<P>
An application creates a mailslot on a local computer by calling the DosMakeMailslot
API and assigning the mailslot a name in the format:
<P>
   \mailslot\<I>name</I>
<P>
where<I> name</I> is a unique set of characters distinguishing the mailslot
from other mailslots on the computer.
<P>
The DosMakeMailslot API returns a handle to the mailslot. This handle then
can be used in the following ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->With DosPeekMailslot to read a message in a mailslot
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>With DosReadMailslot to read and
remove a message<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>With DosMailslotInfo to return information
about a mailslot<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>With DosDeleteMailslot to delete a mailslot
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any application can write messages to any mailslot on any computer on the
network by calling the DosWriteMailslot API. DosWriteMailslot accepts mailslot
names both in a local and remote format, as follows: ┌───────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐│FORMAT
               │TYPE                │
<BR>
├───────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ \"mailslot"\name            │ Local mailslot            │
<BR>
├───────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ \\computername\"mailslot"\ name    │ Remote mailslot            │
<BR>
└───────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
<BR>

<P>
To write data to a mailslot on a remote computer, the name of the mailslot
must also include a computer name. This requirement enables multiple remote
computers to use the same mailslot name locally, but to have different names
on the network.  (The computer name must be unique.)
<P>
Two classes of messages,<I> first-class</I> and<I> second-class</I>, can
be sent to mailslots.
<P>
First-class messages can be sent to servers and peers, but not to requesters.
Delivery of first-class messages is guaranteed: a message is either delivered
or the sender is notified if the message is not delivered. If a mailslot
is full when a first-class message arrives, DosWriteMailslot waits until
DosReadMailslot reads and removes a message from the mailslot or until the
delivery timeout expires (controlled by the<I> timeout</I> parameter in
the DosWriteMailslot API).
<P>
Second-class messages simply are sent; no return code informs the sender
of an unsuccessful delivery.  This simpler delivery system tends to make
second-class messages faster than first-class messages. Second-class messages
sent to a destination on a local workstation are received on the workstation
as first-class messages, with guaranteed delivery.
<P>
An application can write the same message to all computers on the network
that have a mailslot of a particular name. Only second-class delivery is
provided. By specifying an asterisk (*) for the computer name when calling
DosWriteMailslot,
<PRE>\\*\mailslot\<I>name</I>
</PRE>
sends the same message to the named mailslot on every computer in the sender's
primary domain that has the locally created mailslot. There is one limitation:
requesters can receive only second-class messages of up to 400 bytes in
length. Servers can receive first-class or second-class messages of any
size.
<P>
Messages are stored in the mailslot according to when they were received
and the priority assigned them.  Each message is assigned a priority from
0 (low) through 9 (high) by way of the<I> priority</I> parameter of the
DosWriteMailslot API.  Generally, priorities dictate the order in which
messages are stored in a mailslot. High-priority messages are placed ahead
of previously stored messages with the same or lower priority.  However,
since the OS<!-- entering slot 270 --> /2 program is a multitasking operating
system, this scheme cannot be guaranteed.
<P>
Mailslot messages can be read only by the process that created the mailslot.

<P>
The DosReadMailslot API reads and then removes the most current (next available)
message.  Since new messages might be placed in front of other messages
because of priority, a process cannot guarantee that a message read by DosReadMailslot
is the same message seen earlier by DosPeekMailslot.
