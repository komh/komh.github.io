<H1>Return Codes and Symbolic Constants</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
For each API call issued, LAN Server returns a numeric code telling the
application whether the function was successful or why it failed.  (Unless
noted otherwise in the Syntax sections, the return function type is<I> API_FUNCTION</I>.)
To make programming easier, each of these codes also is assigned short,
descriptive text, called a<I> symbolic constant</I> in this book.  For example,
the symbolic constant<I> NERR_Success</I> is equivalent to a return code
of<I> 0</I>, a successful completion.  (A symbolic constant is the same
as a<I> manifest</I> or<I> manifest constant</I>, terms used in previous
releases.)
<P>
The text for the symbolic constant  is defined in the header files (also
called<I> include</I>  files in previous releases).  The header files provided
by LAN Server are installed in the \IBMLAN\NETSRC\H subdirectory by default,
although this can be changed.
<P>
Your application must include any header files that contain symbolic constants
used by your application.  Although an application typically uses more than
one header file, each header file needs to be included only once, usually
at the beginning of the program.
