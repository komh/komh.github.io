<P>
This section presents information programmers should be aware of when using
LAN Server APIs with DOS LAN Services (DLS).
<P>
In this section, you will find information about:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<B>Note: </B> A DLS peer workstation does not participate in any OS/2 LAN
Server domain.  It works like an OS/2 server in a role of standalone or
an OS/2 Peer workstation.  Also, it cannot be administered by using the
NET ADMIN command from a remote node.  However, a user can administer a
DLS peer workstation remotely from another DLS workstation or an OS/2 requester
or server. When porting LAN Server applications to run under DLS, be aware
that DOS, unlike the OS/2 operating system, does not support pointer checking,
semaphores, or shared memory segments.  All file names, directory names,
or parts of a path name, including UNC server and share names, must follow
DOS naming conventions.
<P>
Most of the LAN Server APIs are accessible from a DLS workstation. Except
in several cases, such as the Handle, Mailslot, Named Pipe, and other DOS-supported
APIs, calls to the APIs described in this book can be issued from a DLS
workstation only to remote OS/2 LAN servers.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
