<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_min_passwd_len</I> is the minimum password
length.  The range of values is 0 to MAX_PASSWD_LEN.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_max_passwd_age</I> is the maximum time
(in seconds) since the password was last changed and for which the current
password is valid. A value of 0xFFFFFFFF (TIMEQ_FOREVER) allows the password
to be valid forever.  The minimum value is 1 day.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_min_passwd_age</I> is the minimum time
(in seconds) since the password was last changed and before which the current
password is allowed to be changed.  A value of 0 means no delay is required
between password updates.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_force_logoff</I> is the length of time
(in seconds) after the valid logon hours that the user should be forced
off the network. If the value is TIMEQ_FOREVER (0xFFFFFFFF), the user is
never forced off. If the value is 0, the user is forced off immediately.
Any value between these also can be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_password_hist_len</I> is the length of
the password history (that is, the number of passwords in the history buffer
that are scanned as opposed to the new password in a NetUserPasswordSet
attempt). The new password must not match any of the entries scanned.  The
history is of encrypted passwords. It can be set from 0 to DEF_MAX_PWHIST
(currently 8).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>usrmod0_maxbadpw</I> restricts the number of bad
password attempts.  A value of 0 sets no limits.  This parameter is not
supported in DSS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
