<H1>General DCE Performance Suggestions</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
If your server does a lot of lookups from the backing store routines, you
might speed it up by loading the whole database into memory at startup time,
trading off space for time.  This of course assumes that the database fits
into memory and you have memory to spare.
<P>
A functional problem can sometimes appear to be a performance problem.  If
you have replicated servers and one of the servers goes down, clients may
timeout trying to talk to the dead server before trying the functioning
server.  This gives the appearance that the system is working slowly.
<P>
While RPCs continue to work at low speeds, large amounts of data still take
a while to get across the link.  If you expect your application to be operating
in a low-speed environment, it is very important to follow the suggestions
given above for reducing marshalling time.  Only exchange the minimum amount
of data necessary to get the job done.
<P>
Remember to free memory returned by DCE APIs.  Over time, a small memory
leak in a server can build up to a large amount of wasted swapper space,
and cause performance degradation of the system as a whole, as more time
is spent swapping memory in and out from disk, and less time spent doing
useful work.
<P>
Many of the data structures that APIs return have their own free routines
(for example,<B> rpc_string_free</B>) while others are just freed by the
generic<B> dce_free</B>.  Also be aware of when you should be using<B> rpc_ss_mem_free</B>.

<P>
Also, the sizing of the application servers depends on the types of transactions.
 For example, compare the TPC-A benchmark, where speeds are expressed in
transactions per second, to the TPC-C benchmark, where speeds are expressed
in transactions per minute.  A server can support several more TPC-A clients
than TPC-C clients.
<P>
Dynamic sizing takes several steps.  First you need to determine your application's
load on the security and CDS servers, then decide the server resources required.
Because CDS keeps its directory in memory, it should be CPU-bound and scale
about the same as standard benchmarks.  The security server tends to have
a lot less interaction with applications.
<P>
Second, you need to measure your application server, to find out what throughput
it can sustain.  This depends on the application itself.  If you can do
a comparison of its requirements to the TPC benchmarks, you might be able
to come up with a scaling factor to use, for example, for TPC-A numbers
that you could use to estimate the capacity of different machines based
on their published TPC-A numbers.  Keep in mind that the TPC benchmark numbers
are probably much higher than the typical application, because vendors put
much effort into ensuring that their systems can get high TPC numbers.
