<P>
Binding to a server is an investment of time that you want to use carefully.
Bind once; call often.  Cache server bindings and reuse them as much as
possible.  Do not get a new binding each time for an RPC, to then throw
away when the call is done. While it may be easier to code library routines
and object methods that way, it can make a difference in your application's
performance.
<P>
Structuring a name space can also impact binding performance.  Profiles
and groups add a lot of flexibility, but it takes longer to fetch the members
of a group or profile than it does to read the contents of a server entry.
 For each member of the group or profile, the contents of that member have
to be processed. If you have a deep hierarchy of profiles and groups, the
binding code could check lot of entries before it finds one that matches
the binding request.  A strategy to consider is to start with a single well-known
server name, and then try a group or profile if that fails.
<P>
CDS provides for client-side caching of directory information, and that
caching can dramatically improve binding performance.  Do not disable caching
unless it is absolutely necessary.  The best strategy is to optimize for
the successful case.  Do initial lookup with caching enabled.  If the call
fails using the returned binding, go back and do the lookup with caching
disabled to get the latest up-to-date server bindings and repeat the call.
