<P>
Serial device APIs control shared serial devices and their associated queues.

<P>
For an application to communicate with a device such as a serial printer
or a plotter, the application must be able to communicate directly and interactively.
The communication must allow commands to be submitted dynamically and protocols
to be changed as the application runs. The LAN Server software defines these
types of communication devices as<I> serial devices</I>.  This definition
is not limited to devices attached to hardware serial ports.
<P>
The serial device APIs are used with the CHARDEV.H and NETCONS.H header
files.
<P>
The LAN Server software can pool serial devices of the same type into a
serial device queue to which a requesting application makes its connection.
A<I> serial device queue</I> can contain one or more serial devices and
simultaneously allow multiple applications to connect to one of the available
serial devices. Serial device queues can pool serial devices only on a server.

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Serial device queues exist only while they are being shared.
In contrast, a spooled device queue (such as for a printer) exists from
the time it is created (by calling the appropriate Add function) to the
time it is removed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
Before an application can communicate with a serial device, the following
must occur:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The server must have a serial device connected to
one of its available LPT or COM ports.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A serial device queue must be created and shared on
the network.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A requesting application must (1) explicitly redirect
a local or null device name to the shared serial device queue by calling
NetUseAdd, or (2) implicitly open the serial device queue by calling DosOpen
and specifying the name of a queue.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
An explicit connection allows the application to refer to the serial device
queue with a local device name.  An explicit connection does not, however,
open a serial device.  For more information about redirecting a local device
name to a shared resource, see <A HREF="402_L1_UseCategory.html">Use Category</A>.

<P>
To illustrate how serial devices and queues work on the LAN, consider the
following scenario.  Assume that there are 4 serial devices connected to
the communication ports of a server in the following manner: ┌────────────────────┬───────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│PORT
      │   │DEVICE                     │
<BR>
├────────────────────┼───────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ COM1, COM2, COM3  │    │ Printers                     │
<BR>
├────────────────────┼───────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ COM4        │    │ Special                     │
<BR>
└────────────────────┴───────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
<BR>

<P>
Once the serial devices are connected to the ports of a server, an application
can create a serial device queue by calling the NetShareAdd function and
specifying the share type as a serial device queue. In this scenario, assume
the NetShareAdd function is called three times, creating the following 3
queues: ┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐
<BR>
│ QUEUE NAME        │ PRIORITY   │ DEVICE NAME             │
<BR>
├─────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ SPLQ           │ 5       │ COM4                 │
<BR>
├─────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ PRINTQ          │ 5       │ COM1, COM2, COM3           │
<BR>
├─────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
<BR>
│ VIPPRINT         │ 1       │ COM3                 │
<BR>
└─────────────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
<BR>

<P>
The COM3 port is allocated for use by 2 different queues, PRINTQ and VIPPRINT.
 After calling the NetShareAdd function to create a queue, you can set a
parameter to assign a priority to the queue by calling NetCharDevQSetInfo.
The priority can be from 1 (high) through 9 (low). Generally, the LAN Server
software allows requests to serial device queues with a higher priority
to access the pool of serial devices before other queues with lower priorities.

<P>
At this point, an application can connect to the shared serial device queue
and begin communicating with one of the pooled serial devices in the queue.

<P>
If more than 1 serial device happens to be available in a serial device
queue, the queue returns the first available serial device to the requesting
application. If no devices currently are available, the queue puts the request
on a waiting list<!-- entering slot 411 --> until a serial device becomes
available.  The queue waits only as long as the<I> charwait</I> parameter
of a requester specifies. If the thread undergoes a timeout while waiting
for a serial device to become available, the DosOpen function returns the
ERROR_BAD_NET_RESP error code.
<P>
An application can check (1) a particular serial device to see if it is
working by calling the NetCharDevGetInfo function, or (2) all devices by
calling the NetCharDevEnum function. An application also can check to see
if the queue is busy or where the request of the application is on the queue
waiting list by calling the NetCharDevQGetInfo function. To check all queues,
call the NetCharDevQEnum function.
<P>
Applications can call the NetCharDevQPurgeSelf function to eliminate all
requests submitted to a particular serial device queue from the requester
of that application. To remove all requests submitted by all applications
from the queue, call NetCharDevQPurge.  A process that currently has a device
open is unaffected.
<P>
When the application no longer needs the device, it should call the DosClose
function to return control of the serial device to the serial device queue,
allowing another application to use it. If the application cannot call the
DosClose function successfully to close the serial device queue, the application
can call the NetCharDevControl function to force the serial device queue
closed.
<P>
When an application successfully opens a remote serial device, the values
of the<I> chartime</I> and<I> charcount</I> components from the<I> wksta_info
</I>data structure control how information flows across the network to other
pertinent requesters and servers. Any application changing these values
on the requester where the open was performed should note the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<I> chartime</I> and<I> charcount</I> components
affect all applications running on the requester.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Network efficiency, network response time, and network
throughput might be slowed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
