<H1>16-Bit and 32-Bit Support</H1><!-- entering slot 16 -->
<P>
LAN Server, Warp Server and DSS provide support for both 16-bit and 32-bit
applications.  Support for both types of applications allows a gradual change
of LAN Server APIs into 32-bit worker routines without requiring 32-bit
applications to change.
<P>
The new APIs were created with pure 32-bit programming in mind. In most
cases, however, the 32-bit API is an entry point to 16-bit code.  This implies
that you must use a compiler, such as IBM C Set/2, with these characteristics:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->It can cause the addresses in the process's Local
Descriptor Table to be tiled, allowing simple conversion from flat addressing
to<I> selector</I>:<I>offset</I> and back.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->It allocates memory objects (such as data buffers)
to prevent them from crossing 64KB memory boundaries.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The second characteristic has a further implication.  Just as in the 16-bit
world, buffer sizes are limited to 64KB in length.  No matter how large
a buffer you supply, an API rarely returns more than 64KB of data at a time.
The exceptions are Net32AliasEnum and Net32UserEnum (OS/2 only), which can
return more than 64KB of data.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In DSS, all Net32User and Net32Group APIs support buffers
larger than 64KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
A 32-bit application that uses the Net32 or the Dos32 APIs must define the
constant PURE_32 (not INCL_32) before including any LAN Server header files.
 The constant INCL_32 is for mixed-model programs only. The 32-bit API interfaces
are slightly different from the 16-bit interfaces. The main highlights of
the new APIs are:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<UL>Data
structures
<P>
All data structures and their alignment are unchanged (except that<I> char
</I>becomes<I> unsigned char</I>).  Some 4-byte elements might be aligned
on 16-bit WORD boundaries rather than 32-bit DWORD boundaries.  This is
a compromise between the speed of execution of the API code and application
code.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<UL>Names<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The names of the Mailslot APIs are<!-- entering slot 17 --> changed
from 16-bit DosXXX to 32-bit Dos32XXX.  The 16-bit NetXXX APIs are changed
to Net32XXX for the 32-bit names.  The NetBiosXXX APIs are named NetBios32XXX
for 32-bit, and the UPMXXX APIs are U32XXX for 32-bit applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->The names of the data structures are the same for
all. This means that for a given data structure, you cannot not mix pure
16-bit and 32-bit code.  You can, however, write programs that use the mixed
model (INCL_32 defined) in one file and pure 32-bit code (PURE_32 defined
for OS/2) in another.  You must choose only one type (pure 16-bit, mixed,
or pure 32-bit) for each program file.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Not all 16-bit APIs have 32-bit entry points.  For example,
because 16- and 32-bit file handles are incompatible, there are no Net32Handle
APIs.  In addition, all the APIs in the following categories have no thunked
