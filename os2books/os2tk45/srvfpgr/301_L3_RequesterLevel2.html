<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>resdom_name</I> is the user's default resource
domain.  For LAN Server and OS/2 Warp Server logons, this value is set to
NULL.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<B>Note: </B> Logons invoked from the NetWkstaSetUID2 do not update fields
during logon.  This is consistent with the current implementation; LAN Server
and DSS logons are only supported through the UPMEUSRL API.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
