<P>
The Multi-Protocol Transport Services (MPTS) provided with LAN Server consists
of two components:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->LAN Adapter and Protocol Support (LAPS)<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Socket/MPTS<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The LAPS component of MPTS provides adapter, NetBIOS protocol, LAN Virtual
Device Driver (VDD), and IEEE 802.2 support.  LAPS contains network adapter
drivers that provide communication between a protocol and network adapters,
using the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) as the interface.
 IBM and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) network adapters that comply
with NDIS up to NDIS 2.01 are supported by LAPS.
<P>
The Socket/MPTS component provides a transport framework that lets Socket
applications communicate using TCP/IP, NetBIOS, or Local IPC.  Socket/MPTS
also allows TCP/IP applications to run over NetBIOS, and NetBIOS applications
to run over TCP/IP, using the non-native networking feature of Socket/MPTS.
