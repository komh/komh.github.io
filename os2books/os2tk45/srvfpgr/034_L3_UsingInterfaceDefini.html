<P>
When you define the interfaces to your application using the Interface Definition
Language (IDL), you can minimize the time spent marshalling and unmarshalling
passed parameters.  Use simple structures and avoid pointers.  If an RPC
returns a pointer as an out parameter, the client-side unmarshalling routines
needs to allocate memory for that parameter. Use reference pointers rather
than full pointers when possible.  In many cases reference pointers do not
require memory allocation.  You can reduce the number of pointers by flattening
your data structures, replacing a pointer to an object with an instance
of the object instead.
<P>
Do not transfer anything you do not really need.  Use different data structures
for different calls rather than complex one-size-fits-all structures with
fields that many calls do not use.  Instead of returning data back from
one call to be passed back in subsequent calls, think about caching that
data in a context handle.  Use variable length conformant arrays instead
of maximum-sized fixed length arrays (for example, 1024-byte name fields
sized to handle the maximum possible name). In addition, if the client connects
to the server through a slow link, for example a dial-up link, it takes
a lot longer to send those extra bytes across the wire.
<P>
Investigate using<I> transmit_as</I> to turn large complex structures into
small opaque ones for faster marshalling.
