<P>
LAN Server provides many network services, as well as APIs, you can use
to create other services.  A service is a program, of any size and function,
that other applications can use to perform some set of tasks on the network.

<P>
The two most important services provided by LAN Server are Requester and
Server, which provide the majority of the software required to operate a
local area network.
<P>
The service programs are installed in the \IBMLAN\SERVICES directory. LAN
Server updates the [services] section of the IBMLAN.INI file each time LAN
Server is started, adding any new services, their configuration parameters,
and their default values.
<P>
In the IBMLAN.INI file, you can control when a service is started by changing
one the following two parameters:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>Requester] section, WRKSERVICES parameter<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> Specifies
that a service is to be started at the same time as the Requester service.
 For example:
<PRE>WRKSERVICES=MESSENGER</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>[Server] section, SRVSERVICES parameter<!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> Specifies
that a service is to be started at the same time as the Server service.
 For example:
<PRE>SRVSERVICES = NETLOGON,LSSERVER,ALERTER,REPLICATOR
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If a service is not started when LAN Server is started, you can start it
either from the Network Services window of the LAN Requester graphical user
interface (see<I> LAN Server Network Administrator Reference Volume 3: Network
Administrator Tasks</I>) or from an OS/2 command prompt with the NET START
command.  See<I> Directory and Security Server Commands and Utilities</I> for
more information about the NET START command and the parameters available
for each service.
