<P>
This category includes the following APIs:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->

<A HREF="079_L2_NetAlertRaiseorNet32.html">Alert - NetAlertRaise</A><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>

</UL>
<P>
Alert APIs provide a system for notifying network service programs and applications
of network events. They are used with the ALERT.H and NETCONS.H header files.

<P>
An<I> event</I> is a particular instance of a process or state of hardware
defined by either an application or the LAN Server software.  LAN Server
sends out an<I> alert</I>, in the form of a message or the resetting of
a semaphore, when certain events occur.  Other programs, network services,
or internal network components use the NetAlertRaise API to raise an alert,
notifying various applications or users when a particular type of event
occurs.
<P>
The ALERT.H header file defines the following classes of events for the
alerts that are sent out:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A print job was completed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A
user or application received a broadcast message.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>An entry was added to an error log file.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A network event required administrative assistance.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A user accessed or used certain applications
or resources.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Other classes of alerts can be defined for network applications as needed.
 For example, if an application routinely writes large amounts of data to
a disk drive, running the risk of filling the disk, the user might want
the event of no free disk space to trigger an alert that notifies the application
to pause or end the process slowing the system.
<P>
An application or network service, known as a<I> client</I>, registers to
be notified of an event (or class of events) by calling the NetAlertStart
API.  Each registration adds an entry to an alert table.
<P>
A client can receive alert messages through one of two delivery mechanisms:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A mailslot (registered as \<I>mailslot</I>\<I>name</I>).
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A system semaphore (registered as<I> \sem\</I><I>name</I>).
If a program requires detailed information about an event, it should be
registered as a mailslot, because a semaphore cannot transmit such information.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A client can be registered for one type of event, or it can be registered
for several types by calling the NetAlertStart API a number of times.
<P>
To discontinue alerts for a registered client, use the NetAlertStop API
to remove that entry in the alert table for the particular class of event.

<P>
To change the internal size of the alert table (thus allowing more alerts
to be defined), a user or application must change the<I> numalert</I> component
in the IBMLAN.INI file, and then restart the requester (by using the NET
STOP RDR /Y and NET START RDR commands).
