<H1>Audit Entry Data Structures</H1><!-- entering slot 143 -->
<P>
Audit entry data structures consist of a fixed-length header followed by
0 or more variable-length audit entry data structures.
<P>
In addition to the information contained within it, a data structure can
specify that an additional variable-length ASCIIZ string is to be included.
 To do this, an unsigned short offset is used, where the address of the
additional ASCIIZ string is equal to the address of the variable-length
structure plus the offset.
<P>
For example, assume that<I> ap</I> points to a buffer containing a complete
audit entry and that<I> ae_type</I> contains the value AE_CONNSTOP, specifying
the predefined<I> ae_connstop</I> data structure.  To make the variable
<I>computer_name</I> point to the ASCIIZ string containing the name of the
client whose connection was stopped, an application would perform the following
algorithm:
<PRE>struct audit_entry * ap;           /* fixed portion of audit entry */
struct ae_connstop * acp;          /* variable-length structure */
unsigned char * computer_name;     /* pointer to variable-length string */
                     /* calculate offset to variable-length struct */
 
acp = (struct ae_connstop *) ((unsigned char *) ap + ap-&gt; ae_data_offset);
 
                              /* calculate offset to computer name */
 
computer_name = (unsigned char *) acp + acp -&gt; ae_cp_compname;
</PRE>

<P>
Some of the structures point to more than one data item.  To ensure that
an item is used, the programmer must test for a null pointer and for a null
string.  For example, many audit data structures have a user name and a
computer name.  If the user name is not significant, then the computer name
must be used instead.  To determine if the user name is significant, check
whether<I> ae_so_username</I> is 0 (null pointer) or whether it points to
a 0 (null string).
