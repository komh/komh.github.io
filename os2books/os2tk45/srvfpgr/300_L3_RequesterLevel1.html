<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><I>wki1_logon_domain</I> names the domain to which
the user is logged on. If no one is logged on, it is returned as NULL. In
Directory and Security Server (DSS) logon, there is no domain; therefore,
resource domain broadcast address (RBA) is used.  RBA is the equivalent
of a domain name and can be used as such in other API calls.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
