<P>
The ALERT.H header file contains data structures for predefined alert classes.
 These structures define only the fixed-length part of the information,
not the ASCIIZ strings that follow some of the structures.
<P>
There are five alert types, but only four of these are actual data structures.
 These data structures are arrays, represented by square brackets ([]).
 The Network Message Received alert is not a data structure because it consists
only of the ASCIIZ string of message text received.  Each of the five alert
types is described in the following sections.
