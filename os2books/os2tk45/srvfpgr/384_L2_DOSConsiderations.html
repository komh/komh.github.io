<P>
Under DOS, the NetShareAdd, NetShareDel, and NetShareEnum APIs can be run
on or called from a DLS workstation if DLS Peer service is installed. The
user level security function for DOS LAN Services allows a DLS peer workstation
to run similar to an OS/2 server or an OS/2 peer workstation. In this mode,
resources are shared by the DLS peer workstation based on access rights
an administrator assigns to an individual user or a group of users.
<P>
The rest of the APIs in this category can be run only on a remote server
and, if called locally on a DLS requester, the NERR_RemoteOnly error code
is returned.
