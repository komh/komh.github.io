The UPMEULGN API logs on a user.  This function supports a logon prompt
and registers user IDs like the command-line logon.
<P>
To use the UPMEULGN API, you must be linked to the UPM.LIB library. In addition,
you need at least 8KB of free stack space.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> (unsigned char LSFAR *) points
to an ASCIIZ string containing the password of the user name, obtained by
an application's request to the user.  A null pointer or string indicates
that no password is needed.  After a user is logged on to a requester, the
