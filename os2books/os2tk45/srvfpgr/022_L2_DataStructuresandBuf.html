<H1>Data Structures and Buffer Sizes</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
For both 16-bit and 32-bit applications, each buffer length (specified by
<I>usBuflen</I> or<I> ulBuflen</I>) is limited to 64KB.  The exceptions
are Net32AliasEnum and Net32UserEnum (OS/2 only), which can return greater
than 64KB. For DSS only, all Net32User and Net32Group APIs support buffers
larger than 64KB.
<P>
When a data structure contains one or more pointers to variable-length data
(such as an ASCIIZ string) and is passed between an application and an API,
that application must provide a buffer large enough to store both the fixed-length
and variable-length data.  (Buffer size is specified by the 16-bit<I> usBuflen
</I>or 32-bit<I> ulBuflen</I> parameters.) Otherwise, not all of the data
can be passed or returned.  If the buffer is too small for the fixed-length
data, the API returns NERR_BufTooSmall.
<P>
If a buffer is too small to hold all variable-length data associated with
a structure, your application should notify the API that no variable-length
data is being passed.  This is done by specifying NULL pointers to the variable-length
data.
<P>
If an application calls an API that could return more variable-length data
than the buffer can store, that API returns as much data as possible, setting
any pointers to data not returned to NULL. In this case, the API also returns
the code ERROR_MORE_DATA (value 234) and the number of bytes required to
store all available data (in the<I> pusBytesAvail</I> or<I> pulBytesAvail
</I>value). For some APIs, you can get all the data you want by repeatedly
calling the API, such as NetFileEnum2 (or Net32FileEnum2). LAN Server provides
a sample program (FILEEN32.C) demonstrating this feature of Net32FileEnum2.
 See <A HREF="040_L1_SamplePrograms.html">Sample Programs</A> for an overview
of the sample programs provided with LAN Server.
<P>
For XXXGetInfo APIs, you can determine the necessary buffer size by calling
the GetInfo API with the level parameter set to the level of data structure
you want and<I> usBuflen</I> (or<I> ulBuflen</I>) set to 0. In this case,
the GetInfo API returns the number of bytes available from that API in the
<I>pusBytesAvail</I> (or<I> pulBytesAvail</I>) value.  Then you can call
the same API again and allocate a buffer size (<I>usBuflen</I> or<I> ulBuflen</I>)
at least as large as the returned bytes available.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> This technique should not be used on DSS for NetUser, NetGroup,
NetApp, or NetAlias APIs because it may affect the performance of your application.

<UL> When an application passes a data structure
to the XXXAddInfo or XXXSetInfo APIs, the size of the buffer needs to be
only as large as the fixed-length portion of the data structure.  You do
not need to include space for the variable-length data (if any).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The fixed-length and variable-length data do not have to be contiguous
in the same memory region, even for remote calls.
