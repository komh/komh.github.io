<P>
LAN Server automatically maintains special groups that include all user
IDs that are assigned any level of access authority. There are three special
groups: USERS, ADMINS, and GUESTS. LAN Server places each defined user ID
into one of these three groups according to the user's privilege level.
Each member of these special groups must have one of the following privilege
levels:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->USER_PRIV_USER<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->USER_PRIV_ADMIN<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->USER_PRIV_GUEST<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> No GUEST privileges are provided in DSS.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>

<P>
The APIs in the group category cannot be used to delete users from these
groups, nor can these groups be deleted.  (Although not automatically created,
this is true for members of the group LOCAL, also.) If an application calls
any of the group APIs in an attempt to modify one of these special groups
or one of its members, the API returns the NERR_SpeGroupOp error code.
