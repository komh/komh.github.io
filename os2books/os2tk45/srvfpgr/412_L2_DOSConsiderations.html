<P>
The NetUserPasswordSet API controls a user's password account in a domain.
All of the APIs in this category (except NetUserValidate2) can be called
from DLS workstations, but only to remote LAN Servers. NetUserValidate2
is not supported for DLS workstations.
<P>
There are five types of data structures in the User category: user account,
user modal, user validation, application selector, and logon assignment.

<P>
A DLS peer workstation maintains its own user account database and access
control lists locally.  The peer workstation's user account is never synchronized
with any other user accounts database, like OS/2 LAN Server domain's UAS.

<P>
A DLS peer workstation cannot handle logon requests and therefore, cannot
be a logon server.
