<P>
Under DOS, the functions can be run only on a remote server that has interprocess
communication (IPC) shares. DOS applications use the NMPIPE.H header file
with these APIs.
<P>
DOS supports only client processes; a pipe already must have been created
and connected on a remote server.  Child processes inherit the open file
handles of a parent process.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The Family API (FAPI) replacement library routine for DosOpen
provides support for DASD opens (open Mode Flag 0x8000).  Since DOS does
not support this operation, pipe operations on this type of file handle
return ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE rather than ERROR_BAD_PIPE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>

<P>
DOS supports asynchronous reading and writing of named pipes. DosReadAsyncNmPipe
does an asynchronous read from a file.  It transfers the specified number
of bytes from a file to a buffer asynchronously with the requesting process
execution.
<P>
DosWriteAsyncNmPipe does an asynchronous write to a file. It transfers the
specified number of bytes to a file from a buffer asynchronously with respect
to the execution of the requesting process. (For an example of how to use
DosReadAysncNmPipe and DosWriteAysncNmPipe, refer to <A HREF="498_L1_NotesforDOSApplicati.html">Notes
for DOS Applications</A>.)
<P>
DosBufReset (or 32-bit DosResetBuffer) returns ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE if the
handle is to a named pipe that already has been closed.
<P>
Note that standard C calls to open, to close, or to perform other generic
operations, can be used instead of the corresponding calls to DosOpen, close,
and so on.  This is also true for calls to Int 21 open, close, and other
generic functions.
