<H1>Sample Programs for LAN Server</H1><!-- entering slot 48 -->
<P>
OS/2 LAN Server provides sample application resource files that you can
open and view, print, or possibly use as segments in your own program.  When
you install the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp Version 4 installation
program, these sample files are copied by default into the \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\LANSERV
subdirectory.
<P>
These sample programs are written in 32-bit code, except for MLOGON32.C,
which is a mixed-modal application that includes both 16-bit and 32-bit
API calls.  (MLOGON32.C logs a user on and off a domain.)
<P>
<B>Note: </B> For MOCL sample programs, see<I> IBM DCE for OS/2: Managed
Object Class Library Programmer's Guide and Reference</I>.  For DCE sample
programs, see<I> IBM DCE for OS/2 Warp: Application Development Reference</I>.
