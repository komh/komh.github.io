<P>
The application can specify<I> exclusive access</I>, which inhibits other
applications from acquiring use of the device until released by the owning
application.
<P>
When a device is opened by an application, the physical device resource
is acquired automatically by the newly created device instance.  If the
device instance subsequently loses use of the physical resource, it can
regain use later by issuing MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE. This message enables applications
to participate in a device-sharing scheme, driven by WM_ACTIVATE message
processing, wherein the use of physical devices generally is granted to
the application with which the user is interacting by the application issuing
MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE.
<P>
If a defined device instance loses use of the physical device to other device
instances, that use is regained when the other device instances are closed,
even if MCI_ACQUIREDEVICE is not issued.
<P>
When a process acquires use of a shared device that currently is in use
by another process, the device instance is saved for the previous process.

<P>
Applications receive the <A HREF="160_L2_MM_MCIPASSDEVICE.html">MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
</A>message whenever they gain or lose use of a device.  Use of a device
is not obtained until the <A HREF="160_L2_MM_MCIPASSDEVICE.html">MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
</A>message is received.  This message is posted (by way of WinPostMsg)
to the window handle specified in the<I> hwndCallback</I> field on the <A HREF="407_L2_MCI_OPEN.html">MCI_OPEN
</A>message.  If an invalid or no<I> hwndCallback</I> parameter is provided
on the <A HREF="407_L2_MCI_OPEN.html">MCI_OPEN</A> message, then no <A HREF="160_L2_MM_MCIPASSDEVICE.html">MM_MCIPASSDEVICE
</A>messages are received.
<P>
If the device has been acquired exclusively by another device instance,
the function returns MCIERR_DEVICE_LOCKED.
