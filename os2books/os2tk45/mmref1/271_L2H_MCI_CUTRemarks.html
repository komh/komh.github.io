<P>
If MCI_TO_BUFFER is specified and the buffer is not large enough to hold
the data, then the error MCIERR_INVALID_BUFFER is returned.
<P>
The units of the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters are interpreted in the currently
selected time format.  If neither MCI_FROM nor MCI_TO are specified, the
range is assumed from the current position to the end of the file.
<P>
The difference between MCI_FROM and MCI_TO must be greater than zero; otherwise,
an error is returned.
<P>
If data is already in the clipboard, then it is overwritten. If a cut interrupts
an in-progress operation, such as play, the operation is aborted and an
<A HREF="152_L2_MM_MCINOTIFY.html">MM_MCINOTIFY</A> message is sent to the
application.
<P>
Edited Audio/Video Interleaved (AVI) movie files cannot always be saved
with their original name after the cut operation.  If the clipboard contains
a reference to data that would be erased during saving or if another instance
of the digital video device has a pending paste operation which depends
on this data, the file cannot be saved unless a new file name has been provided.
If a new file name is not provided, MMIOERR_NEED_NEW_FILENAME is returned
by the AVI I/O procedure and a temporary file is created to save the edited
movie.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> AVI is the only video file format supporting editing commands.

Waveaudio Specific
<P>
If either MCI_FROM or MCI_TO begin in the middle of a digital audio sample,
the wave audio device begins at the beginning of that sample. If MCI_FROM_BUFFER
or MCI_TO_BUFFER are used, the<I> pHeader</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 29 FC --> MCI_EDIT_PARMS
</A>must contain a pointer to an<A><!-- external link: 1D 36 29 56 --> MMAUDIOHEADER
</A>structure.  The<I> ulBufLen</I> field of<A><!-- external link: 1D 01 29 FC --> MCI_EDIT_PARMS
</A>must be filled in.
