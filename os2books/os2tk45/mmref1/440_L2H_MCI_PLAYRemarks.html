<P>
The parameters and flags for this message vary according to the selected
device. The units of the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters must be supplied
in the currently selected time format. See the <A HREF="524_L2_MCI_SET.html">MCI_SET
</A>message and the MCI_SET_TIME_FORMAT flag for more information.
<P>
The following example illustrates how the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters
are interpreted. If a multimedia element is composed of samples; in a file
with 100 samples, the samples are numbered from 0 to 99. If MCI_FROM is
specified as 10 and MCI_TO is specified as 80, MCI_PLAY will play samples
10 through 79. Following the play operation, the current position of the
media would be 80.
<P>
If the length of a file cannot be determined, MCIERR_SUCCESS might be returned
even if the MCI_TO parameter is out of range.
<P>
Digital Video Specific
<P>
If you are using an application-defined window and your application is running
on a system without direct-access device driver support for motion video,
do<I> not</I> issue MCI_PLAY with the MCI_WAIT flag specified unless the
thread issuing the message is separate from the thread reading the message
queue.
