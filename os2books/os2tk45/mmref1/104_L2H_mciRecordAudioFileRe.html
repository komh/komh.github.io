<P>
The mciRecordAudioFile function provides a small, simple recorder window,
which allows an object-oriented method of recording audio annotations.  All
play and record operations are from beginning to end.
<P>
This call does not return until the recorder window is closed. The message
queue is processed during the operation of this function. Once the recording
is completed, the window is dismissed.
<P>
This function records 11 kHz, mono, PCM audio data from the microphone input
of the default waveaudio device. The sample size defaults to the card default.

<P>
This function creates the file if it doesn't exist.  If a compound-file
name is specified (d:\path\file+element), the file will be created.  If
it doesn't exist, the element will be created after the record operation
completes.
<P>
The<I> pszFile</I> parameter, which specifies the name of the object to
record into, is an input-only parameter.
<P>
When<I> pszTitle</I> is not specified, the last component of the file name
or the MMIO element name is used.
<P>
This function records<I> only</I> digital audio files.
