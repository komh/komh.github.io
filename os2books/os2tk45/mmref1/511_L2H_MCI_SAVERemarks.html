<P>
If the MCI_SAVE_FILE flag is specified, the current device element is saved
with the file name specified in the<I> pszFileName</I> field.  The file
specified in<I> pszFileName</I> becomes the currently loaded element. If
the MCI_SAVE_FILE flag is not specified or if<I> pszFileName</I> is NULL,
MCI_SAVE saves to the currently loaded element name of the device instance.
 If the current element has not been named, MCIERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND is returned.

<P>
This command is supported by devices which return TRUE to the MCI_GETDEVCAPS_CAN_SAVE
query using the <A HREF="319_L2_MCI_GETDEVCAPS.html">MCI_GETDEVCAPS</A> message.

<P>
The IBM sequencer device does not currently support this message.
<P>
Digital Video Specific
<P>
The MCI_DGV_SAVE_VIDEO_FILE flag is not required; saving a video file is
assumed by default. An edited AVI movie file cannot always be saved with
its original name. If the clipboard contains a reference to data that would
be erased during saving or if another instance of the digital video device
has a pending paste operation that depends on this data, the file cannot
be saved unless a new file name is provided. If a new file name is not provided,
the MMIOERR_NEED_NEW_FILENAME error is returned by the AVI I/O procedure
and a temporary file is created to save the edited movie.  The AVI I/O procedure
alerts the user by displaying a message with the name of the temporary file
that was created.  The application must reopen the temporary file to use
the edited version of the movie.
<P>
During setup for MMIOM_SAVE processing, the AVI I/O procedure checks to
see if the clipboard contains data from a file and if the file needs to
be rewritten.  If these conditions are true, the save operation is aborted
and the MMIOERR_CLIPBRD_ACTIVE error is returned.
