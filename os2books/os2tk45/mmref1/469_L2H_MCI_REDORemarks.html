<P>
MCI_REDO operates on one editing action (for example, cut, delete, paste)
at a time.  If there are no more possible actions to be redone (that is,
the file is in the state where the last change was made), then MCIERR_CANNOT_REDO
is returned.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The redo operation is unlimited corresponding to the number
of undo operations that have been performed. However, after a save, any
previous editing actions are cleared and cannot be redone.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

Not all devices support this message. To determine if a device supports
MCI_REDO, issue <A HREF="319_L2_MCI_GETDEVCAPS.html">MCI_GETDEVCAPS</A>.

<P>
If the redo operation interrupts an in-progress operation, such as play,
the command is aborted and an <A HREF="152_L2_MM_MCINOTIFY.html">MM_MCINOTIFY
</A>message will be sent to the application.
