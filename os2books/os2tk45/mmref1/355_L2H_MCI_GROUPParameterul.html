<UL>
<P>
<B>ulParam1</B> (<A><!-- external link: 1D 96 29 A2 -->ULONG</A>)<!-- lm: 0x11 4 -->
<UL> This
parameter can contain any of the following flags:<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<P>
MCI_NOTIFY<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> A notification message will be posted
to the window specified in the<I> hwndCallback</I> parameter of the data
structure pointed to by the<I> pParam2</I> parameter.  The notification
will be posted when the action indicated by this message is completed or
when an error occurs.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MCI_WAIT<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> Control
is not to be returned until the action indicated by this message is completed
or an error occurs.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The MCI_GROUP message supports several flags, some of which
can be used in combination with each other.  Valid combinations are described
in the flag descriptions below.  An invalid combination results in the MCIERR_FLAGS_NOT_COMPATIBLE
error return code.<!-- lm: 0x2 14 --><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MCI_GROUP_MAKE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>This flag specifies the creation of a group.  MCI_GROUP_MAKE
ties several instances together such that a single command sent to the group
is actually sent to each instance in the group.  This flag can be combined
with any of the other group flags except MCI_GROUP_DELETE, in which case
an MCIERR_FLAGS_NOT_COMPATIBLE error is returned.  Instances must have been
previously opened but these instances can be in any mode (such as playing,
stopped, paused, and so forth) for this message to be successful.  An array
of device IDs is provided by the application in the<I> paulDeviceID</I> field
of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 05 29 FC --> MCI_GROUP_PARMS</A> data structure.
 The number of these IDs is provided by the application in the<I> ulNumDevices
</I>field.  If one or more device IDs are invalid, then the MCIERR_INVALID_DEVICE_ID
error is returned.
<P>
If a device ID or alias references an instance already in another group,
the MCIERR_ID_ALREADY_IN_GROUP error message is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MCI_GROUP_DELETE
<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL>This flag deletes an existing group by disassociating
the instances from each other.  None of the device instances in the group
are closed just the group reference.  None of the other flags can be combined
with MCI_GROUP_DELETE since the only information required by this flag is
a group ID.  If any other flags are specified, an MCIERR_FLAGS_NOT_COMPATIBLE
error is returned.  The MCIERR_INVALID_GROUP_ID error is returned if an
invalid ID is passed.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MCI_GROUP_ALIAS<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
flag specifies that the<I> pszGroupAlias</I> field contains an alias for
the group.  This flag is valid only with the MCI_GROUP_MAKE flag.  The given
alias can then be used to refer to the group from the <A HREF="044_L2_mciSendString.html">mciSendString
</A>interface.  If the alias is already in use, the MCIERR_DUPLICATE_ALIAS
error is returned.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> MCI_GROUP_NOPIECEMEAL<!-- lm: 0x11 14 -->
<UL> This
flag specifies that the group is to be treated as a whole entity rather
than a group of separate parts.  If one of the parts (instances) becomes
inactive, then all the instances in the group become inactive.  This flag
is only valid with the MCI_GROUP_MAKE flag.  If a group is created with
the MCI_GROUP_NOPIECEMEAL flag specified and one or more of the device instances
is already inactive, then the entire group (all device instances) will be
made inactive.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
