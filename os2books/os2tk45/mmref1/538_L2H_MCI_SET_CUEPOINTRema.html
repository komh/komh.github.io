<P>
When the device reaches the specified points during playback, the <A HREF="135_L2_MM_MCICUEPOINT.html">MM_MCICUEPOINT
</A>message is returned to the application using the window handle specified
in the<I> hwndCallback</I> field.  When setting a cue point on, the<I> hwndCallback
</I>field<I> must</I> contain a valid window handle. An error is returned
if a NULL or invalid window handle is specified in<I> pParam2</I>.  Each
cue point can be directed to a different window handle.
<P>
Only one cue point can be set at any given location in the media.
<P>
Cue points can only be set when a device element is loaded, and are reset
when a new device element is loaded.
<P>
Cue points are persistent, that is they remain set after they are encountered.
 A cue point is only considered to have been encountered when the device
passes the cue point location during playback or recording, not during seek
operations.
<P>
If the length of a file cannot be determined, MCIERR_SUCCESS might be returned
even though the specified point is out of range.
<P>
Devices that do not perform their own event detection might have less accurate
cue points.
