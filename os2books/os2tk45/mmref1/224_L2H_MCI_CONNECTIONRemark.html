<P>
It is recommended that all applications refer to connectors using the MCI_CONNECTOR_TYPE
flag.  This provides device independence from differences in connector numbering
for various hardware devices.  Additionally, the MCI_CONNECTOR_INDEX flag
can be used to address different connectors of the same type.
<P>
If only the MCI_CONNECTOR_INDEX flag is used, the referenced connector is
device dependent.  The connector type of a particular connector index, as
well as the number of connectors, can be retrieved using the MCI_CONNECTORINFO
or MCI_SYSINFO messages.
<P>
For a list of connector types which are supported by various device types,
see the<B> Remarks</B> section for <A HREF="238_L2_MCI_CONNECTORINFO.html">MCI_CONNECTORINFO</A>.
