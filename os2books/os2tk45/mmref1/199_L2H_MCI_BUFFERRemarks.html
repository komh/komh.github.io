<H1>MCI_BUFFER - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 200 -->
<P>
On input,<A><!-- external link: 1D F0 28 FC --> MCI_BUFFER_PARMS</A> should
contain the number of buffers to be allocated, the size for each buffer,
and a pointer to an array of<A><!-- external link: 1D 0A 29 FC --> MCI_MIX_BUFFER
</A>structures (one per buffer).
<P>
The mixer will attempt to allocate the number of buffers and size of buffers
to use. If the mixer cannot satisfy the entire request, it will update the
<I>ulNumBuffers</I> field with the total number of buffers that it was able
to allocate. If no memory could be allocated, MCIERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY will
be returned. If memory has already been allocated, and the MCI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER
flag is used, MCIERR_INVALID_MODE is returned.
