<P>
This function provides a simple way of playing a multimedia resource stored
in a program resource.
<P>
The audio is played on the default media control interface device.  A device
control panel is not displayed for audio.
<P>
Still images are not supported.
<P>
For video, the default media control interface driver window is displayed.
 The movie is played from beginning to end.  The window is destroyed when
the device is closed.  If an<I> hwndViewport</I> window is specified, then
the video will be shown in the viewport window.
<P>
The default is to play the resource synchronously unless the MCI_ASYNC or
MCI_ASYNCRENDEZVOUS flag is specified. The message queue is processed during
its processing.
<P>
Either <A HREF="068_L2_mciPlayFile.html">mciPlayFile</A> or mciPlayResource
could return an MCIERR_NO_ASYNC_PLAY_ACTIVE error.  This error indicates
that no asynchronous play is currently active for the associated owner window.

<P>
The title parameter can be NULL.  If a title is specified and a window is
displayed, the title is used as the window title. A window is only displayed
if a video file is played.
<P>
If the<I> resID</I> is 0, MCIERR_MISSING_PARAMETER is returned unless the
MCI_STOPACTIVE or MCI_RENDEZVOUS flags are set. To stop a currently active
command, use the MCI_STOPACTIVE flag.
