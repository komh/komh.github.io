This reference is for application programmers interested in creating OS/2
multimedia applications.  It is also for subsystem developers who are interested
in writing and installing subsystems to support specific data or devices.
The IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 Warp includes the bindings, header
files, and libraries for development of OS/2 multimedia applications. OS/2
multimedia was referred to as Multimedia Presentation Manager/2 or MMPM/2
in previous releases.

The interface definitions for the digital video recording device are also
provided in this reference. The digital video device uses<I> software-only
</I>compression algorithms (<I>software motion video</I>) to enable playing
or recording video without any additional video compression or decompression
hardware.

<B>Header Files</B>
<P>
OS/2 multimedia includes header files with naming conventions compatible
with the standard OS/2 format.  Applications using previous versions of
the MMPM/2 header files will still use those header files by default when
the applications are compiled.  In order to use the OS/2-consistent header
files in an application, define INCL_OS2MM in the program before including
the OS/2 multimedia system header file OS2ME.H.  Defining INCL_OS2MM automatically
defines the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
INCL_MCIOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> MCI-related include files (MCIOS2.H
and MMDRVOS2.H)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>INCL_MMIOOS2<!-- lm: 0x2 29 -->
<UL> MMIO include file (MMIOOS2.H)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following additional header files have naming conventions compatible
with the standard OS/2 format:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
MIDIOS2.H<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>  <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>CDAUDOS2.H<!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->
<UL>  <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
