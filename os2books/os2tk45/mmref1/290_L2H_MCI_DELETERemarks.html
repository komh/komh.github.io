<P>
Neither a user-defined buffer nor the clipboard is used by this command.
 If neither MCI_FROM nor MCI_TO are specified, the range to be deleted is
assumed to be from the current position to the end of the file.  The difference
between MCI_FROM and MCI_TO must be greater than zero, otherwise an error
is returned.
<P>
The units of the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters are interpreted in the currently
selected time format.
<P>
The following example illustrates how the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters
are interpreted.  If a multimedia element is composed of samples and a file
has 100 samples; the samples are numbered from 0 to 99.  If the from position
is specified as 25 and the to position is specified as 30, MCI_DELETE will
delete samples 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.  After the delete, the current position
of the media would be at sample 25.
<P>
Edited Audio/Video Interleaved (AVI) movie files cannot always be saved
with their original name after the delete operation.  If the clipboard contains
a reference to data that would be erased during saving or if another instance
of the digital video device has a pending paste operation which depends
on this data, the file cannot be saved unless a new file name has been provided.
If a new file name is not provided, MMIOERR_NEED_NEW_FILENAME is returned
by the AVI I/O procedure and a temporary file is created to save the edited
movie.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> AVI is the only video file format supporting editing commands.
