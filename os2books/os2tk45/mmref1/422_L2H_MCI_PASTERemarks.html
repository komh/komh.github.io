<P>
The units of the MCI_FROM and MCI_TO parameters must be supplied in the
selected time format. If neither MCI_FROM or MCI_TO are specified, MCI_PASTE
inserts the clipboard contents at the current position.
<P>
The MCI_CONVERT_FORMAT converts what was in the clipboard to the destination
file format.  The following conversions can be done:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>

<B>Settings</B><!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->

<P>
If a paste interrupts an in-progress operation, such as play, the command
is aborted and an <A HREF="152_L2_MM_MCINOTIFY.html">MM_MCINOTIFY</A> message
is sent to the application.
<P>
The implementation of the paste operation for AVI movie files does not support
data transformations. The AVI movie file being pasted into must have the
same video and audio characteristics as the file from which the clipboard
data was obtained. (The video data must have the same nominal frame rate,
frame size, and use the same decompressor; the audio data must be the same
type and must match in number of channels, samples per second, and bits
per sample.) MMIOERR_INCOMPATIBLE_DATA is returned if the clipboard data
does not match the data in the target file.
<P>
Edited Audio/Video Interleaved (AVI) movie files cannot always be saved
with their original name after the paste operation. If the clipboard contains
a reference to data that would be erased during saving or if another instance
of the digital video device has a pending paste operation which depends
on this data, the file cannot be saved unless a new file name has been provided.
If a new file name is not provided, MMIOERR_NEED_NEW_FILENAME is returned
by the AVI I/O procedure and a temporary file is created to save the edited
movie.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> AVI is the only video file format supporting editing commands.
