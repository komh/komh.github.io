<P>
This function provides a simple way of playing a multimedia data file.  It
supports any multimedia file type or RIFF compound files.
<P>
The audio is played on the default media control interface device.  A device
control panel is not displayed for audio.
<P>
Still images are not supported.
<P>
For video, the default media control interface driver window is displayed.
 The movie is played from beginning to end.  The window is destroyed when
the device is closed.  If an<I> hwndViewport</I> window is specified, then
the video will be shown in the viewport window.
<P>
The default is to play the file synchronously unless the MCI_ASYNC or MCI_ASYNCRENDEZVOUS
flag is specified. The message queue is processed during its processing.

<P>
When the file name that is passed is a NULL pointer or an empty buffer,
then an MCIERR_MISSING_PARAMETER error is returned unless the MCI_STOPACTIVE
or MCI_RENDEZVOUS flags are set.  In order to stop a currently active command,
use the MCI_STOPACTIVE flag.
<P>
Either mciPlayFile or <A HREF="081_L2_mciPlayResource.html">mciPlayResource
</A>could return an MCIERR_NO_ASYNC_PLAY_ACTIVE error.  This error indicates
that no asynchronous play is currently active for the associated owner window.

<P>
The title parameter can be NULL.  If a title is specified and a window is
displayed, the title is used as the window title.  A window is only displayed
if a video file is played.
<P>
When the<I> pszFile</I> parameter is specified and there is an active PLAY
command associated with the specified owner window, the first command is
superceded by the second command.
