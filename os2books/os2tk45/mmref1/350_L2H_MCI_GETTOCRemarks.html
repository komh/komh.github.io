<P>
Device and table of contents structure for the currently loaded disc is
returned in the<A><!-- external link: 1D 28 29 FC --> MCI_TOC_REC</A> data
structure. From this point, the controlling program can select the CD audio
object (audio track in this case) to play. If the size of the buffer passed
in is too small to hold all the data returned, then the<I> ulBufSize</I> field
of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 27 29 FC --> MCI_TOC_PARMS</A> structure
contains the required buffer size, the error code MCIERR_INVALID_BUFFER
is returned, and the buffer contains only as much of the GETTOC data as
its size permits.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Not all CD-ROM drives capable of playing digital-audio compact
discs support this feature.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
