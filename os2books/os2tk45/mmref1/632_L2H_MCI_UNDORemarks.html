<P>
After an undo operation, the media position is at the beginning of the media.

<P>
Undo is unlimited.  However, after a save, any previous editing actions
(such as cut, delete, paste) are cleared and cannot be undone. If there
are no possible actions to be undone (the file is in the state where the
last change was made) then MCIERR_CANNOT_UNDO is returned.
<P>
If undo interrupts an in-progress operation, such as play, the command is
aborted and an <A HREF="152_L2_MM_MCINOTIFY.html">MM_MCINOTIFY</A> message
is sent to the application.
<P>
Not all devices support this command.  Use the <A HREF="319_L2_MCI_GETDEVCAPS.html">MCI_GETDEVCAPS
</A>message to determine whether the device supports MCI_UNDO.
