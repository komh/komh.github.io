<P>
Case is ignored in the device name, but there must not be any leading or
trailing blanks. Note that the device type is the<I> pszDeviceType</I> element
of the open data structure, but it does not have a corresponding flag because
it is required and does not have a command-string parameter. Also, if automatic
type selection is desired (through the extensions or EA section or INI),
the file name (including the file extension) must be passed in the<I> pszElementName
</I>field, the<I> pszDeviceType</I> field must be left NULL, and the MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT
flag must be set.
<P>
If a parent window handle is specified, but the window handle is invalid,
the overlay device opens successfully, but uses HWND_DESKTOP as its parent.
