<P>
The parameters and flags for this message vary according to the selected
device. The values of the MCI_TO parameters must be specified in the currently
selected time format.  See the <A HREF="524_L2_MCI_SET.html">MCI_SET</A> message
and the MCI_SET_TIME_FORMAT flag for more information.
<P>
The following example illustrates how the MCI_TO parameter is interpreted.
 If a multimedia element is composed of samples; in a file with 100 samples,
the samples are numbered from 0 to 99. If MCI_TO is specified as 0, the
media is positioned at its start. If an MCI_PLAY message is issued, the
first sample would be the first to play. If MCI_TO is specified as 99, the
media is positioned before the last sample. Issuing an MCI_PLAY message
would play the last sample. Specifying MCI_TO_END would position the media
at the end of the file and the current position would be 100. At this point,
if an MCI_PLAY message is issued, the command would return successfully
without performing any operation.
