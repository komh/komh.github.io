<H1>MCI_MIXSETUP - Remarks</H1><!-- entering slot 408 -->
<P>
On input, the application must fill in the<I> ulDeviceType</I> field of
the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C 29 FC --> MCI_MIXSETUP_PARMS</A> structure
to inform the mixer of the media type it will be sending. The application
must also fill in the<I> pmixEvent</I> field of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 0C 29 FC --> MCI_MIXSETUP_PARMS
</A>structure with a callback function for the mixer to call when it is
finished writing or reading a buffer.
<P>
If the call is successful, the mixer will update the<I> pmixWrite</I> and
<I>pmixRead</I> fields so that the application can write or read buffers
to or from the mixer. In addition, the mixer will update the<I> ulBufferSize
</I>and<I> ulNumBuffers</I> fields with the<I> suggested</I> buffer size
and number of buffers to use with the requested setup. The application does
not have to use these suggested values as they are simply recommendations.

<P>
If the mixer has already been initialized with MCI_MIXSETUP and MCI_MIXSETUP
is called again, MCIERR_INVALID_MODE will be returned.
<P>
After MCI_MIXSETUP has been successfully called, you can use <A HREF="194_L2_MCI_BUFFER.html">MCI_BUFFER
</A>to allocate or deallocate memory for communcation with the audio device.
