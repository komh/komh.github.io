<P>
This command might not be supported by the digital video device.  To determine
whether the device supports the command, issue an <A HREF="319_L2_MCI_GETDEVCAPS.html">MCI_GETDEVCAPS
</A>query.
<P>
The format of the image data returned is specified by the<I> ulPelFormat
</I>and<I> usBitCount</I> fields of the<A><!-- external link: 1D 06 29 FC --> MCI_IMAGE_PARMS
</A>data structure (if possible), unless MCI_CONVERT is specified, in which
case the data is returned in OS/2 memory bitmap format.  The beginning of
the buffer contains the<A><!-- external link: 1D B9 28 11 --> BITMAPINFOHEADER2
</A>data, followed by the palette (if any) and the pel data.
<P>
On dual-plane image capture hardware devices, the image layer content is
assumed.  Only visible data can be captured with some hardware, particularly
single-plane devices. The image data returned will be uncompressed, in either
OS/2 memory bitmap format or device-specific format, based on the setting
of the MCI_CONVERT flag.
<P>
The current settings for IMAGE BITSPERPEL and IMAGE PELFORMAT will be used
if supported by the device.  The IMAGE FILEFORMAT and IMAGE COMPRESSION
settings will be ignored.
<P>
Conversion from internal YUVB format to OS/2 bitmap format is accomplished
with an I/O procedure which can use disk space for temporary storage.  Therefore,
it is possible that errors such as MCIERR_TARGET_DEVICE_FULL (no disk space)
can occur.
