In Windows NT, there is a privilege level that allows a directory or file
to be deleted even if it has the read-only file attribute set. This privilege
level is called Full Control privilege. Full Control privilege, like other
file system security features in Windows NT, applies to the NT file system
(NTFS). Based on the behavior of Windows NT CreateFile and other file-manipulation
functions, it appears that the Full Control privilege level in Windows NT
is the default privilege level for FAT and other file systems as well.  The
Windows NT implementation of file access privileges differs from the OS/2
implementation:
<PRE>┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│FAT                      │Never Full Control       │Always Full Control      │
│                         │privilege                │privilege                │

├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│NTFS                     │                         │Optional Full Control    │
│                         │                         │privilege                │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
In OS/2, the OS/2 behavior is preserved instead of emulating the Windows
NT behavior with regards to the handling of read-only files. For example,
CreateFile can be passed a parameter called CREATE_ALWAYS.  If the file
to be created has the same name as a file that already exists, the CREATE_ALWAYS
parameter causes the existing file to be overwritten.  In Windows NT, if
the CREATE_ALWAYS parameter is used, CreateFile deletes the existing file,
regardless of its attributes, and regardless of the access mode set by fdwAccess
(another parameter that tells CreateFile to open the file as writable or
read-only).  In OS/2, CreateFile fails if CREATE_ALWAYS is used and the
access mode is set to read-only.  In OS/2, CreateFile also fails if any
attempt is made to open an existing file with write access when the file's
read-only attribute is set.  The OS/2 implementation of other file-manipulation
functions, including DeleteFile and WriteFile, similarly respects file attributes.

<P>
Programmers using the OS/2 implementation should be aware that a file's
attributes must be set appropriately before the file can be deleted or opened
with write access.  Furthermore, the implementation requires that a file
must be opened with write access before data can be written to the file.
