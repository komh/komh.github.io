<P>
Logical color palettes cannot contain more entries than the color-depth
of the video driver (for example, on a 256-color driver, you cannot call
the BitBlt function with a color palette of more than 256).
<P>
The XGA video driver (and all based on it) cannot handle being passed a
palette larger than 256 on a machine that has a color-depth of 256.  It
is possible to do this, but the video driver traps.
