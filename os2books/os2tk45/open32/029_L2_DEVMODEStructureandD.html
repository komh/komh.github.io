<H1>DEVMODE Structure and DeviceCapabilities Function</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
Open32 supports the Win32 DeviceCapabilities function but does not support
the old Windows method of loading the printer driver and accessing an internal
DeviceCapabilities function.  Any application that tries to use DeviceCapabilities
or a DEVMODE structure to set or query a printer driver must have the proper
Dynamic Job Properties (DJP)-enabled OS/2 print drivers installed.
