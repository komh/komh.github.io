<P>
In OS/2 there is a default filter of All Files that cannot be removed from
the Type of File combination box.  In Windows, there is no default filter.
 If a Win32 developer adds one or more filters (including, perhaps, an All
Files filter), the Type of File combination box will still have All Files
as a choice.
<P>
But, if a developer does add one or more filters, there is no way to have
the OS/2 All Files filter come up as the default selection. Developers should
be cautioned not to remove the All Files entry if they want the option of
selecting it as their default choice.
<P>
The actual filtering mechanism also behaves quite a bit differently in OS/2:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In Win32, filtering is centralized, and the current
filter can be changed in two different ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->By typing a filter in the File Name edit box (using
wild card characters)<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->By selecting a filter from the List Files Of Type
combination box<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>In
OS/2, the filtering is based on an intersection (or union if the proper
flag is set) of the contents of the File Name field and the filter currently
selected in the Type of File combination box.  This might seem awkward to
Windows programmers because an intersection of a file name of *.txt and
a filter of *.hlp will not display anything (even if txt and hlp files exist)
and a file name of *.* and a filter of *.hlp will display only hlp files.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>In Win32, if a filter is
selected from the List Files of Type list and the File Name field currently
contains wild card characters, then the File Name field will be updated
with the selected filter string.
<P>
For example, if File Name contains *.txt or shell.?pp and the user selects
List Files of Type filter of All Files (*.*), then File Name will be set
to *.*.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
