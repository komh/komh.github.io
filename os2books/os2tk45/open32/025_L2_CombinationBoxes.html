<P>
In Windows, a combination box consists of an edit control, which is a child
of the combination box control and a list box control, which is a child
of the Desktop window.  When the list box is dropped, the list box becomes
a child of the combination box and reverts to being a child of the Desktop
when it is closed.
<P>
In Open32, a combination box consists of an edit control, which is a child
of the combination box control and a list box control which is a child of
the object window.  When the list box is dropped, the list box becomes a
child of the combination box and reverts to being a child of the root object
window when it is closed.
<P>
You will need to slightly modify application code to enumerate and find
a combination list box control in Windows. For the starting parameter in
your enumeration routines, use the following for each platform:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<B>Windows</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Desktop window (GetDesktopWindow)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><B>Open32</B><!-- lm: 0x12 21 -->
<UL> Object window
(HWND_OBJECT)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
When creating an Open32 window that will have combination box children,
do not use the CLIPCHILDREN flag.
