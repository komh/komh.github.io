<P>
When a line is drawn, the number of colors that can be displayed at once
for that line is:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Two for Windows NT<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->One for OS/2<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This difference in drawn colors applies only to lines not to filled regions.
If a brush object is selected and visible foreground and background colors
are chosen, a two-color pattern is drawn when an area is filled using the
brush.
<P>
The OS/2 version of CreatePolygonRgn matches the Windows NT behavior for
brush objects.  However, if a pen object is selected, the OS/2 version draws
only one color, no matter what pen style or background mix are chosen.  Any
gaps in the pattern, as determined by the pen style, will be the color of
the region on which the line is drawn.  This behavior differs from the Windows
NT behavior due to an OS/2 GPI restriction.
