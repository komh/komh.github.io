<P>
The OS/2 version of AdjustWindowRectEx does not emulate the Windows 32-bit
version.  Instead, the OS/2 function calculates the amount of adjustment
necessary to accommodate the window that CreateWindow places on the screen,
so long as the caller passes the same rectangle structure pointer and style
parameters to AdjustWindowRectEx and CreateWindow.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> In Windows, if you call AdjustWindowRectEx with a NULL style
parameter (to indicate the Overlapped style), Windows does not adjust the
rectangle.  Yet, if CreateWindow is called with the same NULL style parameter,
a caption is added.  If the caller tries to use the rectangle returned by
AdjustWindowRectEx to size a window of this style, the sizing is off when
the window is created.  Many other style parameters are treated with this
kind of inconsistency in Windows. In terms of window sizing, Windows is
consistent with itself only where dialogs and overlapped windows are concerned.
 These are the only kinds of windows that really have client areas in Windows.
