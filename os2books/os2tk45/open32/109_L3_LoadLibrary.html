<P>
In OS/2, when LoadLibrary is called to load a device driver without specifying
the complete path to the file, OS/2 might not find the driver. In Windows,
device drivers are typically placed in the Windows system directory. In
OS/2, they are placed in the os2\dll subdirectory. This subdirectory is
typically not in any path so LoadLibrary does not find the drivers unless
the complete path is specified.
