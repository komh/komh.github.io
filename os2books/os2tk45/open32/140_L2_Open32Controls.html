<P>
All Open32 controls, unlike Windows controls, notify their parent when focus
changes.  Care needs to be taken when processing WM_COMMAND messages from
controls so that proper handling based on control type is accomplished.
 You may receive a WM_COMMAND notification from Open32 that you do not receive
from Windows causing unpredictable results.  A well-structured program should
not encounter problems related to these extra notifications.  Open32 applications
can also be enhanced to take advantage of these additional notifications
to provide OS/2-only additional functionality.
