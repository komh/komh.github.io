<P>
To be able to use the Windows NT WinMain() function, use the OS/2 main()
function located in the following subdirectory:
<PRE>TOOLKIT\BETA\SAMPLES\DAPIE\WINMAIN\ma
in.c
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use the main function, a DLL, in the following subdirectory:

<PRE> TOOLKIT\BETA\SAMPLES\DLLMAIN\dllmain.c
</PRE>

<P>
main.c gets compiled and linked with the module containing WinMain and creates
an OS/2 Warp executable.  If you do not use the OS/2 Warp main function,
you receive a link error stating that there is no starting address for your
program.
