<P>
The WM_DRAWITEM message for a combination box or a list box are not exactly
identical to their Windows counterpart.  In Windows, when the item selection
is changed using the mouse or keyboard, two WM_DRAWITEM messages are sent
for the item deselected and four WM_DRAWITEM messages are sent for the item
being selected.
<P>
For the deselected item, the messages received are:

<P>
The order of messages received, assuming the list box had the focus, is:
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
A<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
C<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
D<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
B<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
E<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
F<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
If the list box did not have the focus and the user clicks in the list box
on a new item (such that the list box is also gaining the focus), only messages
A, E, and F are sent.
<P>
If the list box is just receiving the focus but no new item is being selected,
only message F is sent for the item currently selected.
<P>
When the list box loses the focus, only message A is sent for the currently
selected item.
<P>
A special case arises when the user is at the beginning or end of the list
and re-selects the selected item using the mouse or keyboard.  In this case,
only message A is sent.
<P>
In the Open32 implementation, one WM_DRAWITEM message is sent for the item
deselected and one WM_DRAWITEM message for the item being selected.
<P>
For the deselected item, the message received is:

<P>
The order of messages received is A, then B. If the list box did not have
the focus and the user clicks in the list box on a new item (such that the
list box is also gaining the focus), messages A and B are again sent.  If
the list box is just receiving the focus, only message B is sent.  When
the list box loses the focus, the following message is sent for the currently
selected item:
<PRE>旼컴컴컴컴컫컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴쩡컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커

<P>
For the special case when the user is at the beginning or end of the list
and re-selects the selected item using the mouse or keyboard, no message
is sent in Open32.
<P>
When an item is just to be drawn (in response to painting the list is),
the WM_DRAWITEM message received in both implementations is:
<PRE>旼컴컴컴컴컫컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴쩡컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커
쿌         쿚DA_DRAWENTIRE                0                             
읕컴컴컴컴컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸
</PRE>

<P>
In both implementations, the WM_DRAWITEM message received for the combination
box edit are:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
When the edit control receives focus:

쿌         쿚DA_DRAWENTIRE                쿚DS_COMBOBOXEDIT

</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This implementation can cause problems if the drawing of the item's focus
relies on only the ODA_FOCUS Action and the ODS_FOCUS state flags.  Likewise,
problems can occur drawing the item's selection state relies on only the
ODA_SELECT Action and ODS_SELECTED State flags. By properly arranging the
logic for the WM_DRAWITEM message, an application can be written to work
efficiently under both Windows and Open32.
