<P>
In OS/2, the bitmap width and height are bounded by screen resolution.  For
example, for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768, the bitmap:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Width must be between 0 and 1024<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Height must be between 0 and 768<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The plane count usually does not work if greater than 1 because of the restriction
of the physical device.  OS/2 supports a bits-per-pel count of:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 3 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->24<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Any other value fails.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Testing of the Windows 32-bit CreateBitMap function shows
that if CreateBitmap is called to get a handle of a one-plane device-dependent
bitmap, and the third parameter (cPlanes) is greater than one, a handle
is returned as if CreateBimap was successful. However, a subsequent call
to BitBlt or PatBlt reveals that this handle is not valid, because even
though no error is returned, no bitmap appears.  The OS/2 implementation
of CreateBitmap fails in this case (that is, if the plane count is greater
than one).  In other words, the return value from our implementation of
CreateBitmap is NULL.  This is because the underlying call to GpiCreateBitmap
returns an error in this case.
