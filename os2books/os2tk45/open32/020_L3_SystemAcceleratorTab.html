<P>
In Windows, the system accelerator table is processed inside the GetMessage
function before an application calls TranslateAccelerator for its own accelerator
table.  Consequently, in OS/2, all keystrokes handled by the OS/2 system
accelerator table will be filtered before returning from GetMessage.  Most
notably, an OS/2 application will never see the F1 key, which it would see
under Windows.
