<H1>GetAsyncKeyState</H1><!-- entering slot 88 -->
<P>
If GetAsyncKeyState is issued twice in succession while the key is down,
the second GetAsyncKeyState reports the key as being up.
<P>
Virtual keys for regular characters like VK_A, VK_B, and so on are not supported
-- just as they are not supported for GetKeyState.
<P>
For mouse Vkeys like VK_LBUTTON, the synchronous state, rather than the
asynchronous state, is provided becasue PM does not provide any way to get
the asynchronous state of the mouse buttons.
