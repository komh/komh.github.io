<P>
There are two different kinds of Open32 metafiles:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A true Open32 metafile that contains a stream
of GDI commands.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A metafile that has been converted into an Open32
metafile.  A metafile of this type is created by obtaining a metafile handle
through WinTranslateGraphicsObject.  These metafiles are wrappers for an
OS/2 metafile.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You can use GetMetaFileBitsEx with the first metafile type only. This function
does not work with the second type of metafile: a converted metafile.
