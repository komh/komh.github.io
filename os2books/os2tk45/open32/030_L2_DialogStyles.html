<P>
Windows NT does not support system modal dialog boxes.  Therefore, if a
user specifies DS_SYSMODAL style in the resource file for the dialog box
it is ignored.  However, with Open32, the DS_SYSMODAL style is converted
by the SMART tool to FCF_SYSMODAL and the dialog is implemented as a system
modal dialog box.  Windows 3.x does support System Modal dialog boxes.
