<P>
Device context (DC) for display device drivers cannot be deleted through
the DeleteDC function.  A display DC gets deleted automatically when its
associated window is deleted.  If DeleteDC is called to delete a display
DC, a success return code (TRUE) is returned, but the DC does not get physically
deleted.
