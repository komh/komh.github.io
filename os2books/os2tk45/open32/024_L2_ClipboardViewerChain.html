<H1>Clipboard Viewer Chain</H1><!-- entering slot 24 -->
<P>
In implementations of Win32 other than the OS/2 version, applications are
responsible for keeping track of the viewer chain and behaving well. In
OS/2, OS/2 keeps track of the viewer chain, meaning that an application
will always think that there is no viewer following it in the chain, and
applications will never receive the WM_CHANGECBCHAIN message.
