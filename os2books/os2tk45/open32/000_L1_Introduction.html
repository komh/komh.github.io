Open32 provides functions that let programmers maintain application source
code that is common between the OS/2 and Windows 32-bit programming platforms.
Open32 functions are entry points to OS/2 functions that correspond to Windows
32-bit functions. The <A HREF="018_L1_WindowsandOpen32Diff.html">Windows
and Open32 Differences</A> section documents the Windows 32-bit and Open32
behavioral differences. Where appropriate, see the Windows 32-bit programming
reference of your choice for the specific syntax and usage of these programming
interfaces.
