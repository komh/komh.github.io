<P>
In Windows, pattern brushes can be created with bitmaps of any size. Many
of the OS/2 video drivers will only work properly with bitmaps whose widths
are divisible by 8 (but there is no guarantee of consistency), and OS/2
VGA supports only pattern bitmaps that are specifically 8*8 (if a larger
bitmap is specified, all but the lower left 8*8 goes unused).
