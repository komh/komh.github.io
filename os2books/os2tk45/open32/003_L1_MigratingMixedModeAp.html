<H1>Migrating Mixed-Mode Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
This section describes how to migrate mixed-mode applications using Open32
and SMART.  SMART provides a porting mechanism, and Open32 makes the porting
process easier.  It is essential to have a reasonable amount of understanding
of both the Windows 32-bit and OS/2 Warp operating systems to port applications
from one platform to another or create applications that can run on multiple
platforms.  By using Open32 and SMART, you might not need to learn about
certain OS/2 topics, such as the Presentation Manager (PM), but you still
need to be familiar with the unique characteristics of each operating system.

<P>
To port a mixed-mode Windows 32-bit application to OS/2 Warp, you must first
analyze the existing Windows 32-bit application so that you can separate
the common code from the platform-specific code within the Windows 32-bit
application.  Use SMART and the Open32 dictionary to analyze the Windows
32-bit application.  The analysis identifies areas of code that can and
cannot be converted using Open32.  At this point, examine the code for possible
ways of converting the platform-specific functions to Open32.  Many times
there are multiple Windows 32-bit functions implementing a single function.
 Open32 implements only the most commonly used Windows 32-bit functions.
 Often, the percentage of common source can be increased by modifying the
original Windows 32-bit source to use the Open32 functions.  However, there
are some functions that Open32 does not support (for example, OLE) that
must remain platform specific.
<P>
Use the SMART analysis to help you separate the Windows 32-bit common and
platform-specific code.
<P>
When the code is separated, add a header change to the common code section
so that you can successfully compile this code.  This common code can call
platform-specific functions as needed except for those functions mentioned
in <A HREF="004_L2_CommonCodeSupportCav.html">Common Code Support Caveats</A>.
