<H1>Developing Common Source Code</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
IBM analyzed more than nine million lines of Windows 32-bit code and implemented
the most commonly used Windows 32-bit functions and messages in Open32:
approximately 750 Windows 32-bit functions and almost all of the Windows
32-bit messages.
<P>
The Windows 32-bit programs that you will convert to OS/2 Warp programs
fall into one of the two following categories:
<P>
<B>Open32 applications</B> are small sample programs that you can convert
to OS/2 Warp programs by using only the Open32 functions. IBM evaluated
and converted many such programs without any problems. These applications
are called Open32 applications because they use only Open32.  You can compile
the unchanged source with the appropriate header files.
<P>
<B>Mixed-mode Windows 32-bit applications</B> are programs that contain
both Open32 and other non-OS/2 functions and require separation of common
code and platform-specific code into individual source files. Due to the
complex nature of applications and because Open32 is a subset of the Windows
32-bit functions, most of Windows 32-bit applications fall into this category.
