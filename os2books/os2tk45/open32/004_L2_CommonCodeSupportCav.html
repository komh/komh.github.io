<P>
Interoperability does come with certain caveats:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Do not mix and match operations such as Open32 and
OS/2 handles. In other words, do not pass handles that are obtained from
Open32 to OS/2 functions and vice versa.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Try not to mix Open32 and OS/2 functions.  For example,
do not mix Open32 and OS/2 graphics (GPI) calls.  An exception to this rule
is that you can create an OS/2 child window from a Open32 window or vice
versa.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Open32 does not provide complete Windows 32-bit function
compatibility due to underlying differences in the operating system platforms.
 For example, the maximum coordinates allowed in Windows 32-bit are not
the same as those allowed in OS/2.  Open32 supports the maximums imposed
by OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For Registry functions, note that data storage and
retrieval from the Registry requires minor modifications to your code so
that it can work on multiple platforms.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Resource functions are not compatible with Windows.
 Except for the LoadResource function, which returns a pointer to an OS/2
resource structure, each resource function takes a pointer to a resource
structure as a parameter.  These functions take and return pointers to OS/2
resource structures, not Windows resource structures.  Other functions that
fall into this Resource function category include:<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->CreateBitmapIndirect<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->CreateIconIndirect<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->CreateDialogIndirect<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->CreateDialogIndirectParam<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DialogBoxIndirect<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->DialogBoxIndirectParam<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->LoadMenuIndirect<!-- lm: 0x2 8 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 11 -->LoadResource<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
After these changes have been made and the code has been separated, you
are ready to use SMART to convert the platform-specific code. This process
is described in the SMART documentation and in this guide.
