<P>
Windows class names are case insensitive.  OS/2 class names are case sensitive.
 Open32 converts class names to uppercase before registering them with OS/2.
 In general, Open32 that deal with class names work as expected, with respect
to Windows; for example, GetClassInfo returns the class name exactly as
it was originally registered.  One important difference occurs with resource
files, however.  Open32 does not currently support Windows resources; Open32
resources are really OS/2 resources.  If an Open32 resource contains a user-defined
class, the class name must be converted to uppercase because that it how
the class is registered internally with OS/2.
