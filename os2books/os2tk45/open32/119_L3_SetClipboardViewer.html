<P>
In Windows NT, applications keep track of the viewer chain through this
function and ChangeClipboardChain.  In OS/2, OS/2 keeps track of the viewer
chain.
<P>
In OS/2, only one viewer is allowed and OS/2 performs no arbitration when
an application sets itself as the viewer; OS/2 just ends the old viewer
with no warning.  Each application thinks that it is the only viewer in
the system.
<P>
In OS/2, SetClipboardViewer always returns 0.  OS/2 does not tell applications
about other viewers.  In OS/2, it is not the application's responsibility
to pass clipboard messages on to the next viewer in the chain.  In Windows
NT, 0 indicates there is no next viewer.
<P>
In OS/2, applications are never sent WM_CHANGECBCHAIN; this message is meaningless
in OS/2.  In Windows NT, the viewer that is leaving the chain does not get
this message; in OS/2, the other viewers do not know about each other so
this message is meaningless to them.  In Windows NT, they would just pass
it on.
