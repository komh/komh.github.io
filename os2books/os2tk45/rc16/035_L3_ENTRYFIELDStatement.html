<P>
The ENTRYFIELD statement creates an entry-field control.  This control is
a rectangle in which the user can type and edit text.  The control displays
a pointer when the user selects the control.  The user can then use the
keyboard to enter text or edit the existing text. Editing keys include the
BACKSPACE and DELETE keys.  By using the mouse or the DIRECTION keys, the
user can select the character or characters to delete or select the place
to insert new characters. The ENTRYFIELD statement, which you can use only
in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement, defines the text, identifier, dimensions,
and attributes of a control window.  The predefined class for this control
is WC_ENTRYFIELD.  If you do not specify a style, the default style is ES_AUTOSCROLL
and WS_TABSTOP.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

text<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies text that is displayed in the rectangular
area of the control.  This field must contain zero or more characters enclosed
in double quotation marks.  Character values must be in the range 1 through
255.  If a double quotation mark is required in the text, you must include
the double quotation mark twice.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>id<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control identifier. This value
must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned
integer in the range of 1 through 65535, or a simple expression that evaluates
to a value in these ranges.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>x<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>y<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>width<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the width of the control.  This
value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression consisting
of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The width
is in n-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>height<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the height of the control.
 This value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression
consisting of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.
 The height is in 1/8-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>style<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control styles.  This value
can be a combination of the styles specified for WC_ENTRYFIELD. You can
use the bitwise OR (|) operator to combine styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
