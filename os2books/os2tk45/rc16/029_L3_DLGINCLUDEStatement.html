<P>
The DLGINCLUDE statement adds the specified file to the resource file.  The
DLGINCLUDE statement is typically used to let the application access the
definitions file for the dialog box with the corresponding identifier.  The
file named by filename must contain the define directives used by the dialog
box.
<P>
You can provide any number of DLGINCLUDE statements in a resource script
file, but each must have a unique identifier.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
id<!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Specifies the dialog-box identifier. This value
must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned
integer in the range of 1 through 65535, a simple expression that evaluates
to a value in these ranges, or a character string.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>filename<!-- lm: 0x12 13 -->
<UL> Specifies the name of the file containing
the define directives. If the file is not in the current directory, filename
must be preceded by a full path.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
