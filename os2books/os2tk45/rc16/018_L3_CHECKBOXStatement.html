<P>
The CHECKBOX statement creates a check-box control.  The control is a small
rectangle (check box) that has the specified text displayed to the right.
 The control highlights the rectangle and sends a message to its parent
window when the user selects the control.  The CHECKBOX statement, which
you can use only in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement, defines the text, identifier,
dimensions, and attributes of a control window.  The predefined class for
this control is WC_BUTTON.  If you do not specify a style, the default style
is BS_CHECKBOX and WS_TABSTOP.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
text<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies text that is displayed to the right
of the control.  This field must contain zero or more characters enclosed
in double quotation marks.  Character values must be in the range 1 through
255.  If a double quotation mark is required in the text, you must include
the double quotation mark twice.  A tilde ( ~ ) character in the text indicates
that the following character is used as a mnemonic character for the control.
 When the control is displayed, the tilde is not shown, but the mnemonic
character is underlined.  The user can choose the control by pressing the
key corresponding to the underlined mnemonic character.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>id<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control identifier. This value
must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned
integer in the range of 1 through 65535, or a simple expression that evaluates
to a value in these ranges.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>x<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>y<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-left
corner of the control. This value must be a signed integer in the range
-32768 through 32767 or an expression consisting of integers and the addition
(+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The coordinate is assumed to be in dialog
units and is relative to the origin of the dialog box, window, or control
containing the specified control.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>width<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the width of the control.  This
value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression consisting
of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.  The width
is in n-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>height<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the height of the control.
 This value must be an integer in the range 0 through 65535 or an expression
consisting of integers and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator.
 The height is in 1/8-character units.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>style<!-- lm: 0x12 9 -->
<UL> Specifies the control styles.  This value
can be a combination of the styles specified for WC_BUTTON. You can use
the bitwise OR (|) operator to combine styles.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
