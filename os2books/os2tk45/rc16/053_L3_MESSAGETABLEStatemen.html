<P>
The MESSAGETABLE statement creates one or more string resources for an application.
 A string resource is a null-terminated character string that has a unique
string identifier.  A string resource can be loaded from the executable
file when needed by using the DosGetResource function with the RT_MESSAGE
resource type. RT_MESSAGE resources are bundled together in groups of 16,
with any missing IDs replaced with zero length strings. Each group, or bundle,
is assigned a unique sequential identifier. The resource string identifier
is not necessarily the same as the identifier specified when using DosGetResource.
The formula for calculating the identifier of the resource bundle, for use
in DosGetResource, is as follows:
<PRE>bundle ID = (id / 16) + 1
</PRE>
where id is the string identifier assigned in the RC file.
<P>
Thus, bundle 1 contains strings 0 to 15, bundle 2 contains strings 16 to
31, and so on. Once the address of the bundle has been returned by DosGetResource
(using the calculated identifier), the buffer can be parsed to locate the
particular string within the bundle. The number of the string is calculated
by the formula:
<PRE>string = id % 16
</PRE>
(string = remainder for id/16).
<P>
The buffer returned consists of the CodePage of the strings in the first
USHORT, followed by the 16 strings in the bundle. The first BYTE of each
string is the length of the string (including the null terminator), followed
by the string and the terminator. A zero length string is represented by
two bytes:  01 (string length) followed by the null terminator.
<P>
You can provide any number of MESSAGETABLE statements in a resource script
file.  The compiler treats all the strings from the various MESSAGETABLE
statements as if they belonged to a single statement. This means that no
two strings in a resource script file can have the same string identifier.

<P>
Although the MESSAGETABLE and STRINGTABLE statements are nearly identical,
most applications use the STRINGTABLE statement instead of the MESSAGETABLE
statement to create string resources.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
load-option<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies when the system loads the
resource from the executable file into memory.  This value must be one of
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<BR>
PRELOAD<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System loads the resource when the application
starts.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>LOADONCALL<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System loads the resource when the
application calls the DosGetResource or DosGetResource2 function.  This
is the default option.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>mem-option<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies how the system manages
the resource when it is in memory.  This value must be one or more of the
following:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 --> FIXED<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System keeps
the resource at a fixed memory location.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>MOVEABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System moves the resource as necessary
to compact memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>DISCARDABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System discards the resource if
it is no longer needed.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 --> The default setting is MOVEABLE
and DISCARDABLE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>codepage<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies a code page value.  See
<A HREF="019_L3_CODEPAGEStatement.html">CODEPAGE Statement</A> for a list
of valid code pages.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>string-id<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies the character-string identifier.
 This value must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767,
an unsigned integer in the range of 1 through 65535, or a simple expression
that evaluates to a value in these ranges.  The value can be specified in
decimal or hexadecimal notation.  Each string identifier in a resource script
file must be unique.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>string-definition<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies a character string.
 This field must contain zero or more characters enclosed in double quotation
marks.  Character values must be in the range 1 through 255.  If a double
quotation mark is required in the string, you must provide the double quotation
mark twice.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
You can continue a string on multiple lines by terminating the line with
a backslash (\) or by terminating the line with a double quotation mark
(") and then starting the next line with a double quotation mark.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example creates two string resources whose string identifiers are 1
and 2.
