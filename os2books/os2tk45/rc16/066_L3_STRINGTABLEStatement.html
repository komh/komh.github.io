<H1>STRINGTABLE Statement</H1><!-- entering slot 72 -->
<P>
<B>Syntax:</B>
<PRE>  STRINGTABLE  [load-option] [mem-option] [codepage]
  BEGIN
  string-id string-definition
      .
      .
      .
  END
</PRE>

<P>
The STRINGTABLE statement creates one or more string resources for an application.
 A string resource is a null-terminated character string that has a unique
string identifier.  A string resource can be loaded from the executable
file when needed by using the WinLoadString or with DosGetResource with
the RT_STRING resource type. RT_STRING resources are bundled together in
groups of 16, with any missing IDs replaced with zero length strings. Each
group, or bundle, is assigned a unique sequential identifier. The resource
string identifier is not necessarily the same as the identifier specified
when using DosGetResource. The formula for calculating the identifier of
the resource bundle, for use in DosGetResource, is as follows:
<PRE>bundle ID = (id / 16) +1
</PRE>
where id is the string ID assigned in the RC file.
<P>
Thus, bundle 1 contains strings 0 to 15, bundle 2 contains strings 16 to
31, and so on. Once the address of the bundle has been returned by DosGetResource
(using the calculated identifier), the buffer can be parsed to locate the
particular string within the bundle. The number of the string is calculated
by the formula:
<PRE>string = id % 16
</PRE>
(string = remainder for id/16).
<P>
The buffer returned consists of the CodePage of the strings in the first
USHORT, followed by the 16 strings in the bundle. The first BYTE of each
string is the length of the string (including the null terminator), followed
by the string and the terminator. A zero length string is represented by
two bytes:  01 (string length) followed by the null terminator.
<P>
You can provide any number of STRINGTABLE statements in a resource script
file.  The compiler treats all the strings from the various STRINGTABLE
statements as if they belonged to a single statement.  This means that no
two strings in a resource script file can have the same string identifier.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
load-option<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies when the system loads the
resource from the executable file into memory.  This value must be one of
the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
PRELOAD<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System loads the resource when the application
starts.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>LOADONCALL<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System loads the resource when the
application calls the WinLoadString function. This is the default option.
<!-- lm: 0x2 16 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>mem-option<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies
how the system manages the resource when it is in memory.  This value must
be one or more of the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<P>
FIXED<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System keeps the resource at a fixed memory
location.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>MOVEABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System moves the resource as necessary
to compact memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL>DISCARDABLE<!-- lm: 0x2 36 -->
<UL> System discards the resource if
it is no longer needed.<!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
</UL> The default setting is
MOVEABLE and DISCARDABLE.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> code-page<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies
a code page value.  See <A HREF="019_L3_CODEPAGEStatement.html">CODEPAGE
Statement</A> for a list of valid code page values.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> string-id
<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL>Specifies the character-string identifier.  This
value must be a signed integer in the range -32768 through 32767, an unsigned
integer in the range of 1 through 65535, or a simple expression that evaluates
to a value in these ranges.  The value can be specified in decimal or hexadecimal
notation.  Each string identifier in a resource script file must be unique.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>string-definition<!-- lm: 0x12 16 -->
<UL> Specifies
a character string.  This field must contain zero or more characters enclosed
in double quotation marks.  Character values must be in the range 1 through
255.  If a double quotation mark is required in the string, you must include
the double quotation mark twice.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
You can continue a string on multiple lines by terminating the line with
a backslash (\) or by terminating the line with a double quotation mark
(") and then starting the next line with a double quotation mark.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
This example creates two string resources whose string identifiers are 1
and 2.
<PRE>#define IDS_HELLO    1#define IDS_GOODBYE  2

STRINGTABLE
BEGIN
    IDS_HELLO   "Hello"
    IDS_GOODBYE "Goodbye"
END
</PRE>
