<P>
The -d option lets you define up to eight symbolic constants on the command
line.  The syntax is as follows:
<PRE>  -d defname[=value]
</PRE>

<P>
In the previous example, defname is a name, and value is an integer constant,
or an expression. The -d option is useful for passing conditional-compilation
flags to the RC preprocessor.
<P>
The following example specifies a Japanese code-page identifier and also
defines two symbolic constants to be passed to the preprocessor as conditional-compilation
flags.
<PRE>  rc16 -cp 932 -d DEBUG -d VERSION=2 example
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> To process directives in the resource script file, RC uses
the files RCPP.EXE and RCPP.ERR.  Be sure that these files are in the current
directory or in a directory specified by your PATH environment variable.
 RC creates many temporary files and writes them to the directory indicated
by the TMP or TEMP environment variable.  If RC cannot write these temporary
files to this directory, it writes them to the current directory.
