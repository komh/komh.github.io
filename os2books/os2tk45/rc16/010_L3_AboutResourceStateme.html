<H1>About Resource Statements</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
Each resource statement consists of one or more keywords, numbers, character
strings, constants, or file names.  You combine these to define the resource
type, identifier, and data.
<P>
Keywords are words that have a special meaning to the Resource Compiler.
In a statement, keywords specify the resource type, the load and memory
options, and the beginning and end of nested statements. You can use the
RC keywords only as specified in the statement syntax.
<P>
Keywords, except for those specifying directives, can be any combination
of uppercase and lowercase letters.  Note that the curly braces, { and },
are reserved characters.  You can use them in place of the BEGIN and END
keywords.
<P>
Numbers are integers that represent coordinates, dimensions, styles, and
other numeric data.  You can specify numbers in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
notation:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Decimal numbers must contain decimal digits but can start with a minus sign
(-) when they represent a negative number.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Hexadecimal numbers must contain hexadecimal digits (uppercase or lowercase)
and must start with the characters 0x.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Octal numbers are similar to hexadecimal numbers, except that a lowercase
letter o replaces the x.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following example shows several numbers represented in decimal, octal,
and hexadecimal notation:
<PRE>┌────────────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────┐│DECIMAL             │OCTAL               │HEXADECIMAL         │
├────────────────────┼────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
│1                   │0o1                 │0x1                 │
├────────────────────┼────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
│10                  │0o12                │0xA                 │
├────────────────────┼────────────────────┼────────────────────┤

</PRE>

<P>
Statements that create controls in dialog windows and menu items in menus
require that you specify an identifier for each control or menu item. Statements
that create controls also require you to specify coordinates and dimensions.

<P>
Identifiers, coordinates, and dimensions are specified using integer values.
Each supports a slightly different range of values. Identifiers and coordinates
can use either signed or unsigned values;  dimensions only use unsigned
values. Coordinates and dimensions can use unsigned values from 0 through
65535;  identifiers support unsigned values from 1 through 65535. In addition,
identifiers can be character strings as well as numeric values.
<P>
The ranges specific to each are listed in the following table.
<PRE>┌───────────────┬────────────────────┬───────────────┬──────────┐
│               │Signed Range        │Unsigned Range │Strings   │
├───────────────┼────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────┤
│Identifiers    │-32768 through 32767│1 through 65535│Yes       │
├───────────────┼────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────┤
│Coordinates    │-32768 through 32767│0 through 65535│No        │
├───────────────┼────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────┤
│Dimensions     │Not applicable      │0 through 65535│No        │
└───────────────┴────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────────┘
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use simple expressions that evaluate to a value in the appropriate
range;  this enables you to, for example, specify dimensions or coordinates
that are relative to those of a corresponding dialog window or menu. A resource
identifiers encoded as an expression must resolve to an unsigned integer,
not a string.
<P>
Character strings represent names, labels, titles, and messages. A character
string consists of one or more characters enclosed in double quotation marks.
Character values must be in the range 1 through 255. If a double quotation
mark (") is required in a string, you must include the double quotation
mark twice. The meaning of each character value (that is, the character
each value represents) depends on the code page (character set) defined
for the resource script file.
<P>
The Resource Compiler<!-- entering slot 12 --> interprets the backslash
(\) as an escape character in character strings.  You can include any ASCII
character in a character string by specifying either \xdd, where dd is the
hexadecimal representation of an ASCII character, or \nnn, where nnn is
the octal representation of an ASCII character.  If a backslash is required
in a string, you must include the backslash twice.
<P>
In addition, when character strings are used as resource identifiers additional
rules apply:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They must be enclosed in double quotation marks (").
If a double quotation mark is needed inside the string, it is encoded as
two double quotation marks in a row.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They cannot contain any character larger than 0x7F.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They must be delimited by whitespace, just as an integer
ID is.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Resources whose resource ID is compiled into a 16-bit
value in the binary data area, such as MENUITEM with its menu-id field,
or HELPSUBITEM with its child-window-id field, cannot use character strings
for IDs.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->They can contain an embedded newline character by
continuing the string on the following line without closing the string.
When the input file represents newlines as 0x0D+0x0A or by 0x0D+0x0D+0x0A,
the string is compiled with the sequence 0x0A to represent the newline.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Duplicate string IDs are not permitted for resources
of the same type. However, the same string resource identifier can be used
to identify resources of different types.
<P>
When the Resource Compiler is compiling a script file and encounters more
than one resource of the same type having the same string ID, it will generate
an error message and stop compiling the file. When the Resource Compiler
is binding a .RES file and encounters more than one resource of the same
type with the same string ID, it will generate a warning message and ignore
the second resource identifier;  only the first resource having the duplicated
identifier will be bound to the file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Constants are names that have been assigned values by using the define directive.
 A constant can represent a number, a character string, or other data.  Most
resource statements in a resource script file use constants, and many use
the constants defined in the OS/2 header files (for example, os2.h).  For
this reason, you should always use the include directive to include OS2.H
in your resource script file.
<P>
File names are OS/2 file names.  If the specified file is not in the current
directory, you must specify the drive, directory, and file name.
<P>
Resource statements have three basic forms:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Single-line statements<!-- lm: 0x2 6 --> Multiple-line statements<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<BR>
Directives<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Single-line statements consist of a keyword identifying the resource type,
a number or character string which specifies the resource identifier, and
a file name specifying the file containing the resource data. For example,
this ICON statement defines an icon resource:
<PRE>  ICON 1 myicon.ico</PRE>

<P>
The icon resource has the icon identifier 1. The file MYICON.ICO contains
the icon data. The same example, using character strings for identifiers
is shown below:
<PRE>  ICON "MyIcon" myicon.ico
</PRE>

<P>
Multiple-line statements consist of a keyword identifying the resource type,
a number or character string which specifies the resource identifier, and,
between the BEGIN and END keywords, additional resource statements that
define the resource data. For example, this MENU statement defines a menu
resource:
<PRE>  MENU 1
  BEGIN
      MENUITEM "Alpha", 101
      MENUITEM "Beta",  102
  END
</PRE>

<P>
The menu identifier is 1.  The menu contains two MENUITEM statements that
define the contents of the menu.
<P>
In multiple-line statements such as DLGTEMPLATE and WINDOWTEMPLATE, RC allows
any level of nested statements.  For example, the DLGTEMPLATE and WINDOWTEMPLATE
statements typically contain a single DIALOG or<!-- entering slot 13 --> FRAME
statement.  These statements can contain any number of WINDOW and CONTROL
statements; the WINDOW and CONTROL statements can contain additional WINDOW
and CONTROL statements; and so on.  The nested statements let you define
controls and other child windows for the dialog boxes and windows.  If a
nested statement creates a child window or control, the parent and owner
of the new window is the window created by the containing statement.  (FRAME
statements occasionally create frame controls whose parent and owner windows
are not the same.)
<P>
Directives consist of the reserved character # in the first column of a
line, followed by the directive keyword and any additional numbers, character
strings, or file names.
