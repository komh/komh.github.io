<P>
The purpose of the NMAKE32 tool is to automate the process of updating project
files.  NMAKE32 compares the modification dates for one set of files (the
target files) with those of another set of files (the dependent files).
If any dependent files have changed more recently than the target files,
NMAKE32 executes a series of commands to bring the targets up-to-date.
