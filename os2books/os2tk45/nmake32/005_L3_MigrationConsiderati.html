<P>
NMAKE32 is fully compatible with previous versions of NMAKE with the following
exceptions:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When the -n option is specified, only commands prefixed
with &amp; or $(MAKE) are executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Parentheses must be used to group expressions in directives
that contain multiple expressions.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Control characters used in filenames and pathnames
in a makefile must be preceded by a caret (^) character so that they are
not evaluated by NMAKE32.  This is especially important in pathnames where
an ending backslash character could erroneously be treated as the line concatenation
operation by NMAKE32 instead of the literal backslash character intended
by the makefile writer.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A pseudo-target without a dependent must contain a
command block.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
