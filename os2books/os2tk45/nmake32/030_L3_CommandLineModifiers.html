<H1>Command Line Modifiers</H1><!-- entering slot 31 -->
<P>
The NMAKE32 syntax includes prefixes that change the way it handles command
processing. By prepending these special characters in front of a command
you can alter NMAKE32 default behavior for a given command.
<P>
The following are the defined prefixes and their usages:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><I>command</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Execute<I> command</I> in silent
mode. Prevents the command from being displayed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> -<I>command
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Ignore the return codes from<I> command</I>.
This prefix sets the %status built-in function with the return code of<I> command</I>,
but prevents NMAKE32 execution interruption if it was non-zero. Similar
function to the /i option on the command line.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> -n
<I>command</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Ignore all return codes for<I> command
</I>less than or equal to n.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> ~<I>command</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Propagate
the return code from the previously executed command and prevent NMAKE32
execution interruption if<I> command</I> returns a non-zero value. When
used in conjunction with the %status() built-in function (for use in !if
expressions) returns the value of the last command's return code. This combination
is very useful for doing post-processing on commands, even if those commands
have failed.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
This example will execute a command that has a non-zero return code and
NOT interrupt NMAKE32 execution. It will propagate the return code from
that command for later processing.
<PRE>#  Execute an intentionally bad command

target:
   -copy garbage.txt filename

!if %status()==1
   ~@echo the %status is set to 1
   ~@echo these commands would usually update %status
!endif

copy hello.c hello.z

!if %status()==0
  @echo  the status value is 0
</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>!<I>command</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL> Execute
the command for each dependent in the $? macro values.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> =<I>command
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Force date, time and path rechecking for the
current target after all commands for the target have been executed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> &amp;<I>command
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 16 -->
<UL>Execute this command, even if the -N flag was
specified.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The built-in commands, such as %echo and %cd, ignore the command
line modifiers, and the -n command line modifier cannot be used with a built-in
command. Remember the built-in commands are handled internally, so they
do not provide return codes and are not echoed.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
