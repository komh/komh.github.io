<H1>Predefined Macros</H1><!-- entering slot 37 -->
<P>
The following macros are defined (or read from the environment variable)
by NMAKE32 before the first file is read.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
MAKEDIR<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Current working directory when NMAKE32 is
invoked.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MAKE<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> The name of
the NMAKE32 program.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MAKEVER<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> The
current NMAKE32 version number.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> MAKEFLAGS<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> All
command line parameters, plus the values form the MAKEFLAGS environment
variable, except for b, f, o, p, and x options.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TIMESTAMP
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Data and time when NMAKE32 was started. The format
is locale specific.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> DATE<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Date
from TIMESTAMP in the form:  YYYYMMDD (for example, 19960325)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> TIME
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Time from TIMESTAMP in the form:  HHMMSS (for example,
123015)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> AS<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Expands to the
default assembler, which is "masm" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> CC<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Expands
to the default C language compiler, which is "icc" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> COBOL
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Expands to the default cobol compiler, which is
"cobol" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> FOR<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Expands
to the default fortran compiler, which is "fl" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> PASCAL
<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>Expands to the default pascal compiler, which is
"pl" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> RC<!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> Expands
to "rc", the resource compiler, which is "rc" on OS/2.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following macro, while not predefined by NMAKE32, also has special significance

<PRE><B>.PATH.</B><B><I>ext</B></I><B> = </B><B><I>path_list</B></I></PRE>

<P>
where:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<I>ext</I><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> is the extension for which the search
path should be applied.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><I> path_list</I><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> is
the list of paths, separated by semicolons. Note that macros are expanded
in this path list, so $(INCLUDE), $(DPATH), or any other macro or environment
variable could be used.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The<I> path_list</I> is only used when a dependent file specification has
no path and cannot be found as specified. NMAKE32 tries to locate the file
in each of the paths specified in the<I> path_list</I> which matches that
file's extension. It uses the first copy of the file found in the path list.

<P>
Any number of these macros (one per extension) may be defined in a description
file, so that any or all of the file extensions that are specified in your
description file may be supported.
