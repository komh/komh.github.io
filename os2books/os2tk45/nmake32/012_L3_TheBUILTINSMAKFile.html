<H1>The BUILTINS.MAK File</H1><!-- entering slot 13 -->
<P>
In addition to the TOOLS.INI file, NMAKE32 supports the use of an optional
file named BUILTINS.MAK.  NMAKE32 will process either the TOOLS.INI or the
BUILTINS.MAK file.  If a TOOLS.INI file is not found, or the nmake section
does not exist, NMAKE32 automatically searches for the BUILTINS.MAK file
in the current directory or the file as specified by the -b flag.  When
an initialization file is processed, it is included as part of the makefile
currently being executed.  This feature allows the user to supplement the
set of predefined macros that NMAKE32 supports and to maintain an additional
set of inference rules.
<P>
Like the TOOLS.INI file, the BUILTINS.MAK file can be used to customize
default options for NMAKE32.  For example, if an inference rule is needed
for several description files, instead of modifying all the description
files, the rule can be added to the BUILTINS.MAK file.  Unlike the TOOLS.INI
file, an "[nmake]" section is not expected.  All lines from the file are
expected to be valid description file statements.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
The lines in the BUILTINS.MAK file below do the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define the CFLAGS macro as a null string<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Redefine the predefined inference rule to build .obj
files from .c source files using the CFLAGS macro<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<PRE>CFLAGS=.c.obj:
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $*.
