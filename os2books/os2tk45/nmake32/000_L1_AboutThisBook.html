This document describes the Enhanced Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE32).
This is a new utility that provides a superset of the features found in
the "legacy" NMAKE utility.  Since there are some behavioral differences
between the new and old versions of the tool, they are being provided separately
so that users can select the version that works best for them.
