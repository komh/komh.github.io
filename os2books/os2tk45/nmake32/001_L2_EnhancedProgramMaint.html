The Enhanced Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE32) automates the process
of updating project files and can be used to make backups, configure data
files, and run programs when data files are modified.
<P>
<B>Description</B>
<P>
The Enhanced Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE32) compares the modification
dates for one set of files (the target files) with those of another set
of files (the dependent files).  If any dependent files have changed more
recently than the target files, NMAKE32 executes a series of commands to
bring the targets up-to-date.
