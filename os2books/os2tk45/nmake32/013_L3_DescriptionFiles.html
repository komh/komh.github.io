<H1>Description Files</H1><!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
The file that contains the set of customized rules for NMAKE32 is a special
file referred to as a description file. The default description file that
NMAKE32 will search for is named<B> makefile</B>.  The /f option is used
to provide a description file name when the user does not want to use the
default description file.  NMAKE32 will return an error if a description
file is not provided.  A description file consists of the following elements:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Description blocks<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Macro definitions<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Inference rules<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Directives<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The following syntax rules apply to description files:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A target/dependency statement must begin in column
one.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A command line must begin with a space; it cannot
start in column 1.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->A backslash(\) at the end of a line tells NMAKE32
that the next line is a continuation of the current line.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->An unescaped pound sign (#) anywhere on a line in
a description file indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment.
Since the lines in an in-line file are processed by the command shell, specifying
comments is specific to the shell in use. In OS/2, CMD.EXE uses<B> rem</B>.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
NMAKE32 uses the target/dependency rules in the description file to determine
if a target needs to be updated.  All dependents are recursively checked
for being out of date with respect to their dependents.  Missing targets
are considered to be out of date.  If a target is determined to be out of
date, the command associated with the target/dependency statement is executed.
 See the following example:
<PRE>    program.exe:    program.obj  abcd.obj        ilink program abcd;

    program.obj:    program.c   xxx.h
        icc program.c

    abcd.obj:       abcd.c      xxx.h
        icc abcd.c
</PRE>

<P>
The above example description file says that program.exe depends on two
files, program.obj and abcd.obj, and that they in turn depend on their corresponding
files, program.c, abcd.c and a common include file, xxx.h.
<P>
When NMAKE32 is executed with the above description file, it would determine
that program.exe was the main target and that abcd.obj and program.obj are
the files that it depends on. NMAKE32 would then recursively determine that
program.obj depends on program.c and xxx.h, and that abcd.obj depends on
abcd.c and xxx.h. Thus, NMAKE32 constructs a graph of file dependencies.
Starting from each node of the graph, NMAKE32 compares the modification
date of each node (file) to its immediate descendants. If a file is older
than one or more of its descendants, then the command associated with the
file is executed to bring the file up to date.
<P>
When the above description file is processed by NMAKE32, assuming that each
.obj file is older than the corresponding .c file, the following commands
would be executed:
<PRE>   icc -c program.c
   icc -c abcd.c
   ilink program abcd;
</PRE>

<P>
These are all the necessary commands to make program.exe from program.c,
abcd.c, and xxx.h. If any of these commands encountered an error, NMAKE32
would immediately terminate and report which command failed.
<P>
If the file abcd.c was modified, then executing NMAKE32 again would only
execute the commands necessary to bring program.exe up to date. The commands
executed now would be:
<PRE>   icc -c abcd.c
   ilink program abcd;
</PRE>

<P>
If the file program.exe was missing, executing NMAKE32 would execute the
following command:
<PRE>   ilink program abcd;
</PRE>

<P>
If the file xxx.h was modified, executing NMAKE32 would cause all the commands
to be issued again because abcd.obj and program.obj depend on it.
