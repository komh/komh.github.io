<P>
Read-time processing occurs during the reading of the description file,
in a similar manner to the C language's preprocessor stage, and essentially
determines which parts of the description file are used. At read-time all
of the statements beginning in column 1 are processed. During read-time
processing, the graph of all targets and their dependents is built, macros
are initially defined, and directives are processed. Run-time processing
begins after read-time processing has completed, and is the stage during
which NMAKE32 checks file dates/times, and invokes any required commands.
At run-time the statements that are not in column 1 are processed.
<P>
Every directive may be used during either read-time or run-time, with different
effects.
