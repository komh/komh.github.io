<H1>Macro Expansion and Nesting</H1><!-- entering slot 53 -->
<P>
To fully understand the effects of macros in a description file it is useful
to know a little about how NMAKE32 operates. During read-time, NMAKE32 expands
all macros except those occurring within a command block. Macros used in
command blocks are expanded at run-time, and they will have the last value
defined at read-time.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
Given the following description file excerpt:
<PRE>     MAC = 1
     !IF "$(MAC)" == "1"
     target0:
        @ECHO The value was 1
        @ECHO $$(MAC) is $(MAC)
     !ENDIF
     MAC = 2
</PRE>

<P>
returns:
<PRE>     The value was 1
     $(MAC) is 2
</PRE>

<P>
The !IF directive will evaluate to non-zero and execute the command block
for target0 because directives are processed at read-time, and at this time
the value of MAC is 1. Since MAC is redefined at the end of the description
file, the run-time value is now changed to 2. The target0 command block
is executed at run-time so the value displayed for the definition of MAC
is 2.
<P>
Macro references may also be nested. Macros are said to be nested if an
expanded macro is used as part of another macro reference.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
If the following macros are defined:
<PRE>   A = X
   B = Y
   C = Z
   $XYZ = hello
</PRE>

<P>
then a reference to the following macro:
<PRE>   $($A$B$C)
</PRE>

<P>
would have the definition hello.
