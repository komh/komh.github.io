<H1>Dependent Specific Rules</H1><!-- entering slot 22 -->
<P>
There is a method of choosing a command block to be executed based on which
dependents cause the target to be updated.  If an object library contains
both compiled files and assembled files, you might want to generate the
objects and update the library in different ways depending on which file
types were updated.  NMAKE32 supports this with dependent specific rules.
 These rules are similar to regular rules, but are identified by using two
colons (::) between the target and the dependents, and the target is usually
specified in more than one description block.  The following description
blocks are permissible:
<PRE>X :: a
   command block

X :: b
   command block
</PRE>

<P>
The following example shows how dependent specific rules can be utilized.

<PRE>object.lib :: a.asm
 $(AS) a.asm;
 $(LIB) object -+a.obj;

object.lib :: b.c
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) b.c
 $(LIB) object -+b.obj;
</PRE>

<P>
The two description blocks both update the library named object.lib, however,
the first command block is only executed if a.asm is newer than object.lib,
and the second command block is only executed if b.c is newer than object.lib.

<P>
Whenever there is a target that appears in more than one description block,
and the target/dependency separator is a single colon (:), the two description
blocks are merged by concatenating the command blocks and the dependents.
