<H1>Explicit Command Processing</H1><!-- entering slot 24 -->
<P>
Explicit commands are contained in the command block that follows a target/dependency
statement. It is the block of commands that will be executed if the target
needs updating.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>targ.obj :  program.c            #  Target / dependency statement
  icc /c /Fotarg.obj program.c
</PRE>

<P>
Whenever there is an explicit command associated with a target/dependency
statement, inference rule processing is not attempted.
<P>
Paths may be specified for targets and dependents. A target file in the
specified target directory will be built or updated if the dependent is
found in the specified directory.
<P>
When paths are specified in curly braces on file specifications, the default
is to use the local directory. If a file is not found that matches the file
specification in the local directory, then the path in curly braces (or
paths, separated by semicolons) is searched in the order given.
<P>
A file can be both a target and a dependent in a description file. If the
file is specified with curly brace paths in any instance, all instances
of that file must contain the same curly brace paths. If the file is not
specified the same way in all instances, it will be treated as a different
file specification.
<P>
When specifying multiple search paths in curly braces on targets and dependents,
the paths are specified in the following manner:
<PRE>{p1;p2;p3} targ.obj : {p4;p5;p6} dep.c   # Multiple paths in curly braces
    $(CC) -c -Fo$@ $&lt;                    # Explicit rule for target/dependency
</PRE>

<P>
File specifications can be combined with relative path specifiers to modify
the local directory or to modify the paths in curly braces. The relative
path specifier is included on the file specification. The relative path
specification works in OS/2 in the following manner:
<PRE>cd e:\os2\system\test     # executing this from the e: drive
                          # would locate you in the specified
                          # directory

dir ..\..\filename.txt    # This file specification includes a
                          # relative path specification.  It
                          # will look for filename.txt in the os2
                          # directory
</PRE>

<P>
.PATH macro processing is used to search for unlocatable files after any
applicable curly brace paths have been processed. .PATH searches are applied
if the unlocatable files match the .PATH macro extensions and do not have
a path or relative path included in their file specification.  The .PATH
macro processing method of searching for files works only with target/dependency
statements that have an explicit rule.
<P>
.PATH processing functions similar to explicit curly brace processing in
that it will use the first file it finds, starting with the .PATH processing
functions similar to explicit curly brace processing in that it will use
the first file it finds, starting with the local directory and then searching
the paths specified by .PATH.
<P>

Macros</A>.
