<H1>Built-in Commands</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
Built-in commands are operations handled internally by NMAKE32, rather than
passed out to the operating system. All built-in commands begin with a percent
sign (%).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI>cd<I> directory</I><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Instructs NMAKE32 to change
the current directory to<I> directory</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> %do<I> other_target
</I><!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Instructs NMAKE32 to invoke the commands of
target<I> other_target</I> as though they were inline. All built-in macros
(such as $@ and $?) associated with the current target and dependents remain
unchanged; only the commands are used.
<P>
This built-in command can be used to set up generic rules which can be invoked
repetitively from different points in your description file.  Note that
it does not matter where<I> other_target</I> was defined, as long as it
is visible to NMAKE32 during the processing of your description file.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>  # Use the %do command in the target/dependency  # command using the target comp_rule:  This target
  # is not listed as a dependent of any other target,
  # and is only accessible via the %do command.

  comp_rule:
     $(CC) -c -fo$@ $&lt;

  all: test1.obj test2.obj        # define targets to build

  test1.obj: test1.c              # first target/dep pair
    %do comp_rule                 #   %do command

  test2.obj: test2.c              # second target/dep pair
    $(CC) /c -fo$@ $&lt;             # use explicit command
</PRE>

<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<LI>echo<I> string</I><!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<UL> Instructs NMAKE32 to display
the contents of string (after expanding any macros)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> %set
<I>var=value</I><!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<UL> Instructs NMAKE32 to assign value
to the variable<I> var</I>. There are instances where it would be a valuable
feature to be able to change the value of a variable after NMAKE32 has read
all the description files and has begun execution.  The %set command allows
to you to change or create any NMAKE32 variable while commands are being
invoked.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> %setenv<I> var=value</I><!-- lm: 0x2 24 -->
<UL> Instructs
NMAKE32 to assign value to the environment variable<I> var</I>. If the variable
is not already defined, it is created with the specified value; if the variable
is already defined, its value is replaced by the specified value.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
