<H1>Inference Rules with Curly Braces</H1><!-- entering slot 27 -->
<P>
Inference rules can be combined with specified target/dependency paths for
each rule. Given the inference rule below, if a dependent file with the
given extension is found in the dep_path directory during inference rule
processing, then the target will be updated in the specified target_path
directory. These paths are specified in the inference rules inside curly
braces. Only single paths are supported inside curly braces on inference
rules. However, multiple inference rules using the same extensions and different
paths can be specified. The first matching inference rule is the rule that
is used if multiple inference rules are specified in the description file.

<PRE>{dep_path}.extension1{target_path}.extension2:
    command block
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE># Build objects in the p2 directory from source
# in the p1 directory

{p1}.c{p2}.obj:
    icc /c /Fo$@  $&lt;

p2\file.obj: p1\file.c
</PRE>

<P>
When using paths or target/dependency statements and curly brace paths on
inference rules, all paths must be carefully matched. When a  target/dependency
statement dependent path does not match the curly brace  path on the inference
dependent extension, it is deemed a mismatch. The following example combines
inference rules, paths and explicit rules to demonstrate correct application
of the rule concepts.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>{p1}.c{p2}.obj:                 #  Valid .SUFFIXES: extensions
    $CC) $(CFLAGS) /Fo$@ $&lt;     #  First inference rule

{p3}.c{p4}.obj:                 #  Valid .SUFFIXES: extensions
    $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) /Fo$@ $&lt;  #  Second inference rule

{p1}.c{p4}.obj:                 #  Valid .SUFFIXES: extensions
    $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) /Fo$@ $&lt;  #  Third inference rule

p2\dep.obj : p1\dep.c           #  Target / dependency statement
    @echo Bogus explicit rule   #  Explicit rule

p4\dep.obj : p1\dep.c           #  Target / dependency statement
                                #  with no explicit rule
</PRE>

<P>
The application of the inference rules for the target/dependency with no
explicit rule is as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The first rule does not apply, because it is
an inference rule to create objects in the p2 directory from source in the
p1 directory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The second rule does not apply, because it is
an inference rule to create objects in the p4 directory from source in the
p3 directory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The third inference rule creates objects in the
p4 directory from source in the p1 directory.  This rule is used.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Although the paths for the dependent and target
on the first target\dependency statement match the first inference rule,
the inclusion of an explicit rule in this dependency precludes it from being
built using any inference rule processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The third inference rule is the rule that applies to the second target/dependency
statement. The target will be updated in the p4 directory from the dependent
in the p1 directory, if required.
