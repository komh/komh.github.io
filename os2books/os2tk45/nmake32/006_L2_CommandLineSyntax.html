<P>
NMAKE32 accepts certain flags on the command line, each of which may be
specified in upper or lowercase (or any combination). Flags may be listed
together following a single "-" or "/" sign. For example, the following
invocations are equivalent:
<PRE>nmake32 -N /d -P

nmake32 /n -dP

nmake32 /ndp
</PRE>

<P>
Some flags require an additional value. In every case, the value must be
specified as a separate argument at invocation. If more than one flag that
requires a value is given, the values are assigned in the order that the
flags were specified. For example, the following invocations are equivalent:

<PRE>nmake32 -FBD mymake.fil mybuilt.ins

nmake32 -D -F mymake.fil -B mybuild.ins
</PRE>

<P>
Following is the general syntax for NMAKE32:
<PRE>nmake32  [flags]  [targets]  [var=val]  [@responsefile]
</PRE>
