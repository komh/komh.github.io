<H1>Why Use NMAKE32?</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
Large projects tend to have many source files.  Often, only a few source
files need to be compiled when a change is made.  NMAKE32 allows a user
to set up a special file called a "description" file (or "makefile") that
tells NMAKE32:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Which files depend on others<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Which commands, such as compile and link commands,
need to be carried out to bring programs up to date.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
This use of NMAKE32 is only one example of its power.  By building suitable
description files, NMAKE32 can be used to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make backups<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Configure data files<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Run programs when data files are modified.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
