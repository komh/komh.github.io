<H1>Separator Transformation</H1><!-- entering slot 50 -->
<P>
Syntax:
<PRE>     $[s,<I>separator</I>,<I>string</I>]
</PRE>

<P>
In this transformation, NMAKE32 will place the separator text between every
two words in<I> string</I>. This transformation is useful when a character
other than a space is required to separate multiple words on a program's
command lines, or when writing in-line files.
<P>
The<I> separator</I> text can be enclosed in quotes, and if so, can contain
special characters such as spaces, commas, and the following escape sequences:

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Escape Sequence<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \"
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Double quote<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \n<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> New
line<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \r<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Carriage return
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>\t<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Tab<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \\
<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL>Backslash<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \nnn<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Character
with octal value nnn<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> \xnn<!-- lm: 0x2 21 -->
<UL> Character
with hex value xnn<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>

<B>Example:</B>
<P>
When creating a response file for a program, such as LINK386 which has a
limit to the length of any single line in the response file, and a method
for continuing that single logical line across several physical lines, the
following transformation macro should be used. Assuming the line continuation
character is a plus sign(+), and there is a long list of object modules
in the macro OBJS:
<PRE>     OBJS = p1.obj p2.obj p3.obj</PRE>

<P>
The transformation:
<PRE>     $[s,"+\n",$(OBJS)]
</PRE>

<P>
would return
<PRE>     p1.obj+
     p2.obj+
     p3.obj
</PRE>

<P>
Using this macro, the line limit will not be exceeded, and they can be put
together in one logical line.
<P>
In the above example, NMAKE32 will take a list of object file specifications
and place one per line in a response file. However, since NMAKE32 never
changes the text, the file specifications will end up as they were specified,
without information such as paths.
<P>
Since the expansion of the built-in macros can yield path information, the
separate and pattern matching transformations can be nested for more flexibility.

<P>
If the following line was in a description file:
<PRE>     prog.exe: $(OBJS) prof.def other.lib
</PRE>

<P>
The following transformation:
<PRE>     $[s,"+\n",$[m,*.obj,$**]]
</PRE>

<P>
would return only those dependents of prog.exe that are object modules,
 but with any path information that NMAKE32 was able to determine, and write
them one per line.
<PRE>     &lt;path for p1&gt;\p1.obj+
     &lt;path for p2&gt;\p2.obj+
     &lt;path for p3&gt;\p3.obj
</PRE>
