<H1>Inference Rules</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
Inference rules allow you to define rules that can be used for more than
one file. When NMAKE32 encounters a target/dependency statement with no
commands, it looks for an inference rule that specifies how to create the
targets based on the defined .SUFFIXES extensions, the defined inference
rules, and the target/dependent base file names.
<P>
In order for an inference rule to be applied, three conditions must be met:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The extensions of the target file and the dependent
file must be defined in the .SUFFIXES: target<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->There must be a valid inference rule with correct
path specification defined.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The target and dependent must have the same base file
name.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
A valid  inference rule, with local directory path specification, starts
in the first column of the description file, and consists of the dependent
extension, followed by the target extension and a colon. The command block
starts on the following line, and must be preceded by at least one space.

<PRE>   .extension1.extension2:       [command..]
</PRE>

<P>
Given a target/dependent statement, with the same base file name, and valid
file extensions in the .SUFFIXES: target, NMAKE32 will search for a defined
inference rule, and execute the rule if available. If the target and all
dependents exist, and a rule cannot be inferred, the target is assumed to
be "up to date".
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>  .c.obj:
     icc -c -Fo$@  $&lt;

  hello.obj : hello.c
</PRE>

<P>
Similarly, given a target without a dependent or a command block, NMAKE32
will infer a dependent file from the targets base file name and all inference
rules defined with the target's file extension. The inference rules are
searched in the order that they are defined in the .SUFFIXES target.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<PRE>  .SUFFIXES: .c .asm .obj .exe

  .obj.exe:
     icc -fe$@ $&lt;

  .c.obj:
     icc -c -f$@ $&lt;

  .asm.obj:
       masm $&lt;;

  target.exe: header.h
  target.obj:
</PRE>

<P>
In the preceding example, NMAKE32 will search for an inference rule that
builds a .exe file, it will locate the .exe.obj rule, using the target filename
and the source extension, target.obj will be inferred as a dependent. It
will then check to see if it can locate an up-to-date target.obj on disk,
or can build one.  When NMAKE32 locates target.obj as a target defined in
the description file, it will try to build it. In order to build this file
it will use the same inference rule process to infer the dependent target.c
(searching extensions in the order given by .SUFFIXES). If target.c did
not exist on disk or could be built from the description file, the next
inference rule evaluated would be .asm.obj:, and the next inferred dependent
would be target.asm.
