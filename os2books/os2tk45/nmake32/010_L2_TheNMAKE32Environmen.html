<H1>The NMAKE32 Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
NMAKE32 automatically accesses all environment variables, converting each
into a macro of the same name.  Following is the evaluation precedence of
macros:
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Priority<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Definition<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 1  (Highest)
<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL>Macros from the command-line<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 2
<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL>Macros from the description file and its include
files.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 3<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Environment variables.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>4<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Macros from TOOLS.INI
or BUILTINS.MAK<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 5  (Lowest)<!-- lm: 0x2 18 -->
<UL> Predefined
macros (such as MAKEDIR or TIMESTAMP)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that macro definitions found at a higher priority replace macro definitions
at a lower priority (for example, macros from the description file replace
macros from the built-ins file).
<P>
The -e flag causes macros defined from environment variables to overwrite
previously defined macros (switches the processing of numbers 2 and 3).

<P>
The MAKEFLAGS environment variable is generated by NMAKE32 to contain all
input flags specified on the NMAKE32 command line, except for the -b, -f,
-x, -o and -p flags (and their corresponding values).
<P>
If it is not already in the environment, NMAKE32 creates the MAKEFLAGS variable
and sets it according to the current flags, and passes it on to nested NMAKE32
invocations as they are called. Therefore, MAKEFLAGS  always contains the
current input flags.
<P>
Each time NMAKE32 is executed, it reads the MAKEFLAGS  variable from the
environment. If it exists and is non-null, its contents are processed before
the NMAKE32 command line is processed.
