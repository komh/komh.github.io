<P>
Occasionally, the commands given in a description file exceed the command-line
limit of the operating system. To avoid this, NMAKE32 allows the user to
generate in-line files which can be read as response files by other programs.

<P>
The syntax to generate an in-line file is:
<PRE>     target: dependents
        <I>command</I>  &lt;&lt;[<I>filename</I>]

     &lt;any text&gt;
     &lt;any text&gt;
     .
     .
     .
     &lt;&lt;[KEEP | NOKEEP]
</PRE>

<P>
where &lt;any text&gt; can be text, macros, file names, predefined macros,
or anything valid for the command executing.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Loops are not detected.
<P>
All of the text between the two sets of double less than signs (&lt;&lt;)
is placed into an in-line file and given the name<I> filename</I>. The inline
file can be referred to later by using<I> filename</I>, providing the keep
option is specified. If<I> filename</I> is not given, NMAKE32 gives the
file a unique name in the directory specified by the TMP environment variable.
This temporary file is erased after NMAKE32 has processed the command block.
The in-line file can be temporary or permanent. If you do not specify otherwise,
or if you specify the keyword NOKEEP, the in-line is temporary. Specify
KEEP to retain the file. If the -N flag was specified, NMAKE32 will display
the contents of the in-line file.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Blank lines and comments are not ignored if they occur in
an in-line file.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
Below is a description file excerpt which shows how to create an in-line
file for the link program:
<PRE>     target.exe: file1.obj file2.obj file3.obj file4.obj lib1.lib lib2.lib
         ilink @&lt;&lt;
      $[s,"+\n",$[m,*.obj,$**]]
      $@
      $*.map
      $[s,"+",$[m,*.lib,$**]]
      ;
      &lt;&lt;
</PRE>

<P>
NMAKE32 creates a file, in this case the file name is determined at run-time,
and places the following lines into it.
<PRE>     file1.obj+
     file2.obj+
     file3.obj+
     file4.obj+
     target.exe
     target.map
     lib1+lib2
     ;
</PRE>

<P>
NMAKE32 executes the command ilink with a response file using the name determined
by NMAKE32, and erases the file.
