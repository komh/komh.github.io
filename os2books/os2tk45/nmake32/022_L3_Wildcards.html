<P>
In some cases, it is not desirable to have to specify all the filenames
that are required to build a target. OS/2 wildcards ('*' and '?') are supported
on the dependency file specification.
<P>
Wildcards cannot be used in a dependency list to reference files that do
not exist at the time of execution of NMAKE32. Files that will be generated
(dependents from one target/dependency statement that are targets in another
target/dependency statement) during NMAKE32 execution cannot be referenced
using wildcards.
<P>
Wildcards cannot be used on targets or for path specifications.
