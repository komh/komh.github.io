<H1>Escape Characters</H1><!-- entering slot 61 -->
<P>
Several control characters are used by NMAKE32 in its syntax. These characters
are:
<PRE>(          )     #     $     ^     \
{          }     !     @     -     [newline]
</PRE>

<P>
To use one of these characters in a command and not have it interpreted
by NMAKE32,  a caret (^) is used in front of the character.
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>
<P>
The string:
<PRE>     BIG^#.C
</PRE>

<P>
is treated as
<PRE>     BIG#.C
</PRE>

<P>
With the caret, you can include a literal newline character in a description
file. This capability is useful in macro definitions, as in the following
example:
<PRE>     XYZ=abc^&lt;enter&gt;
     def
</PRE>

<P>
where &lt;enter&gt; is a newline character.
<P>
The effect is equivalent to the effect of assigning the C-style string abc\ndef
to the XYZ macro. Note that this effect differs from the effect of using
the backslash (\) to continue a line. A newline character that follows a
backslash is replaced with a space, unless the -\ option is specified. NMAKE32
ignores a caret that is not followed by any of the characters it sees in
its syntax.
<P>
<B>Note: </B> Control characters in the makefile that are used in filenames,
pathnames, and so on, that are not to be evaluated by NMAKE32 must be preceded
by the caret (^) character.  For example, to define a macro which contains
the root directory specifier<B> C:\</B>, the backslash character must be
preceded by a caret character, since the backslash character is used to
concatenate lines in NMAKE32.  The proper way to define this macro is:
<PRE>  root=C:^\
</PRE>

<P>
If the macro was coded without the caret character, such as in:
<PRE>  root=C:\
  !ifdef root
      .
      .
      .
</PRE>

<P>
an error would result, since NMAKE32 would concatenate the root macro definition
with the next line in the makefile.  Placing a caret character before the
backslash character prevents NMAKE32 from processing the backslash as a
control character.
