<H1>What is Presentation Manager?</H1><!-- entering slot 67 -->
<P>
Presentation Manager provides a windowed graphical user interface for OS/2
applications. The user interacts with these applications using interface
constructs controlled by Presentation Manager, with either the keyboard
or the mouse.  For example, when a program asks you to enter a short piece
of text such as a file name, you type it into a Presentation Manager control
known as an<I> Entry Field</I>,  when a program wishes to display a scrollable
list it uses a control known as a<I> List Box</I>, and so on. Presentation
Manager has two basic objectives:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->To provide a<I> consistent</I> user interface for
both the operating system and applications, so that users may more easily
interact with a number of applications, without the need to learn different
sets of interface rules.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->To provide an<I> intuitive</I> interface for the end
user, in order to ease the task of learning applications and reduce the
amount of formal training required by encouraging learning through exploration.

The Presentation Manager user interface is based on <A HREF="256_L2_icon.html"><B>icons</B></A>,
which are used to represent the objects with which the user wishes to work,
and <A HREF="298_L2_windows.html"><B>windows</B></A>, which typically provide
views of the contents of those objects.  For example, an icon might represent
a document which the user wants to modify; in order to do this he would
open a view of the document in the form of a window displaying the text
in an editable form.  When he has finished working on the document he would
close the view.

The basics of the Presentation Manager user interface are described in <A HREF="074_L1_PresentationManagerC.html">Presentation
Manager Components</A>.

The implementation of Presentation Manager under OS/2 Version 2.0 has been
enhanced over previous versions of OS/2.  Presentation Manager itself has
been rewritten to take advantage of the 32-bit functions available in Version
2.0, resulting in improved performance, particularly for complex graphical
applications, and several new user interface controls and standard dialogs
have been introduced  in conformance with the 1991 Systems Application Architecture*
(SAA*) Common User Access* (CUA*) Workplace Environment. The Information
Presentation Facility (IPF) has also been enhanced.
