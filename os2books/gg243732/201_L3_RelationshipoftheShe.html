<H1>Relationship of the Shell to the File System</H1><!-- entering slot 221 -->
<P>
The WPS represents program and data files with icons and allows you to move
and copy them around the system in a similar way to the OS/2 Version 1.3
File Manager. There are also new functions like "shadow copy" and new objects
like the system clock which have behaviors completely unlike those previously
seen in the File Manager.
<P>
The implementation of the Workplace Shell in OS/2 Version 2.0 is not inherently
file-oriented but the current implementation only supports files, not data
records or transactions. Data file and program icons may represent files
on a disk. A folder is represented by a real directory under its name. <A HREF="047_L2_DiskStructureSupport.html">Figure
"Data Structure Supporting the Workplace Shell"</A> shows the approximate
disk structure which supports the WPS.
<P>
As you can see, all folders are contained within the desktop and the directories
of each folder on the desktop are subdirectories of the "OS!2 2.0 DESKTOP"
directory. From the directory structure we can see that the screen will
display a<I> Documents</I> folder on the desktop and it, in turn, will contain
three other folders; SCRIPTFILES, PERSONAL and 1992PLAN.
<P>
Icons in any folder can be dragged (moved) into another folder or onto the
desktop. When this happens, the file system will handle it in two different
ways. If it is a data file it will be physically moved to the new directory.
If it is a program reference or a shadow copy of a data file, then a pointer
to the original object and its working directory is passed from one folder
to the other.
<P>
The relationship of the desktop to the file system is shown in <A HREF="048_L2_DragDropPhysicalImpl.html">Figure
"Drag/Drop - Physical Implementation"</A>
<P>
Both the folder and the abstract objects in it are stored as pointers (called
<I>HOBJECT</I>s) in the OS2.INI file (see <A HREF="218_L3_RunningPrograms.html">Running
Programs (Folder Contents)</A> for more details). When a program is copied
to another folder, the HOBJECT of the program is placed in that folders
area within the OS2.INI file. The HOBJECT is also placed in the EAs of the
directory which corresponds to the folder, along with its position within
the folder.
<P>
Handling programs in this manner makes sense because, if the programs' main
executable modules were to be moved, the executable files could become separated
from their DLLs. This approach allows a program to be copied and moved around
the desktop without having to be physically moved.
<P>
"Shadows" of file objects are handled in a similar way to programs; the
original file is left in the source folder but a pointer to it is created
in the target folder. HOBJECTs are discussed further in <A HREF="203_L3_Folders.html">Folders</A>.

<P>
There are some problems associated with the Workplace Shell implementation.
These are outlined below and discussed in more detail in the rest of the
chapter:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The system is critically dependent on a single file,
OS2.INI, for much of the information. Damage to this file can have a disastrous
effect on the user's working environment.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The WPS uses EAs to store settings for files. However,
EAs are not recognized by all file systems, nor by any DOS or Windows programs.
 This can cause problems when setting up the working environment for a user
who needs both OS/2 and DOS programs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->With a FAT file system,<!-- entering slot 222 --> moving
files can lengthen disk access times as files become fragmented and the
tables become cluttered. This would impact users who want to migrate their
systems from DOS to OS/2 V2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A program file is treated by the WPS as either a program
reference object or a data file object, depending on the view used. Once
registered as a program reference object and placed in a folder, the WPS
restricts the actions which can be performed on it. For example, copying
or moving the object moves the program reference, not the underlying file.
Viewing the object from the<I> Drives</I> folder, however, allows the user
to work with the physical file. Thus direct manipulation in the WPS means
that sometimes the program file can be moved and sometimes it cannot.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->While data files and programs are handled by the shell,
there is no base class for record structures and transactions. To be able
to create a persistent "transaction" object capable of interacting fully
with the other WPS objects might require us to derive a new base class from
<I>WPObject</I>. See<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development
</I>for a more detailed discussion of this issue.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
