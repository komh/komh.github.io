<H1>Using Workplace Shell Classes</H1><!-- entering slot 205 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell introduces several new classes derived from the<I> SOMObject
</I>class; for example, class definitions for a folder (<I>WPFolder</I>),
a program reference (<I>WPProgram</I>) and a printer (<I>WPPrinter</I>).
 The class hierarchy of the classes used in the Workplace Shell is illustrated
in <A HREF="045_L2_WorkplaceShellClassH.html">Figure "Workplace Shell Class
Hierarchy"</A>.
<P>
Notice that this hierarchy includes three so-called<I> base classes</I> from
which all the remaining classes are derived;  these base classes are also
known as<I> base storage classes</I> because the fundamental difference
between them, and therefore between all their derived classes, lies in the
way they store their control data. For a fuller discussion of this see <A HREF="197_L1_WorkplaceShellImplem.html">Workplace
Shell Implementation</A>.
<P>
If you want to implement a new WPS class, you must first decide which of
the existing classes provides the most promising base from which to work
-  you have to subclass one of them. Early experience suggests that subclassing
the existing base classes or their derivatives is usually the more practicable
approach - implementing a new base class by subclassing WPObject may be
desirable but should be regarded as a very major piece of work.
