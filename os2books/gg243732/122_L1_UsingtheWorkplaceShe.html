<H1>Using the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 129 -->
<P>
To use the Workplace Shell (WPS) a user must understand the topics covered
below. The user must know how to select an object, how to open a view (or
window) of that object, and how to perform some basic actions on that object,
such as printing, copying, creating, tailoring, and deleting.
<P>
Most importantly, however, the user must start thinking about<I> objects
</I>instead of<I> applications.</I>  The metaphor behind the Workplace Shell
is data-centric rather than application-centric. Once the object/data is
found, the operating system does the rest. Some of the navigation and operation
can be done using the keyboard but it is almost impossible to work without
a mouse.
