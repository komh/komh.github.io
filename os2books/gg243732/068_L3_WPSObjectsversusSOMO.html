<H1>WPS Objects versus SOM Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 71 -->
<P>
Please note that in this book, and in most other discussion of the Workplace
Shell, we use the word <A HREF="268_L2_object.html"><B>object</B></A> in
two quite distinct, but closely related, senses:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A Workplace Shell object is something that a user
interacts with and manipulates, and is represented by an icon.  It normally
represents some real-world item that the user understands, such as a printer
or an order form.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A SOM object is a programming construct and is the
basis of SOM's implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP).  It
may represent something quite meaningless to the user such as a database
table, or an APPC conversation; fortunately, a user would not normally know
anything about SOM objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Workplace Shell objects are implemented as SOM objects, but SOM objects
do not necessarily have anything to do with Workplace Shell; indeed a SOM
object may not have any visible form at all, being no more than a piece
of program code and data.
<P>
It should normally be clear from the context which sense of the word<I> object
</I>is intended.
