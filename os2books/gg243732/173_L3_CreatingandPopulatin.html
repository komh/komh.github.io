<H1>Creating and Populating Folders</H1><!-- entering slot 184 -->
<P>
One of the things an administrator will commonly wish to do is to to create
and populate new folders for a user. The process is straightforward and
can be automated using REXX programs.  Several examples are provided below.
The REXX commands used are explained in <A HREF="221_L1_UsingREXXinOS2V20.html">Using
REXX in OS/2 V2.0</A>.
<P>
The process involves:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Creating a folder, which in turn will create
a directory within the desktop structure<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Copying data files into it (optional)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Creating new program objects within it.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
For example, if you wanted to create a new folder on the desktop and call
it<I> MyFolder</I>, use the procedure in <A HREF="038_L2_REXXProceduretoCreat.html">Figure
"REXX Procedure to Create a New Folder."</A>
<P>
To add an editor to the folder,<I> MyFolder</I>, that was just created,
use the procedure in <A HREF="039_L2_REXXProceduretoAddaP.html">Figure "REXX
Procedure to Add a Program to a Folder."</A>
<P>
The above examples show how to add instances of existing classes (Folder
and Program), but you may also want to add new classes which you have created.
You must first register a class with WPS before you can create an instance
of it.
<P>
The example below shows how to register a<I> Password</I> folder. The design
and coding of this folder is described in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:
 Application Development</I>. To register this new folder class, use the
procedure in <A HREF="040_L2_REXXProceduretoRegis.html">Figure "REXX Procedure
to Register a New WPS Class."</A>
<P>
To "deregister" the class when you want to remove it from the WPS classes,
use the procedure in <A HREF="041_L2_REXXProceduretoDereg.html">Figure "REXX
Procedure to Deregister a WPS Class."</A>
