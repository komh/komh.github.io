<H1>Accessing a Context Menu</H1><!-- entering slot 137 -->
<P>
All objects have a context menu which is activated by pointing at the object
and depressing mouse button 2 (this is also known as "popping up" a menu).
These menus are contextual because the content depends on the capabilities
of the individual object. They can often be extended by the user so new
functions can be added to the object.
<P>
Usually these context menus reflect the capabilities of a single object.
 One has to be careful when selecting several objects and then activating
the context menu of one of the objects.  This menu then shows only those
choices which pertain to<B> all</B> of the selected objects.
