<H1>Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 237 -->
<P>
Extended Attributes (EAs) are widely used in the Workplace Shell to record
information about the attributes of the WPS objects. In general, information
about an object is stored by the object itself. Thus a file stores information
about its class and the location of the icon used to represent it, while
the folder stores the position of the icon within it.
<P>
On an HPFS partition, Extended Attributes are stored in a special, hidden
area, close to the files themselves. On a FAT file system, Extended Attributes
for files and directories are stored in a hidden file in the root directory
of each FAT partition..  This file is named "EA_DATA. SF".
<P>
EAs for the Workplace Shell are stored in the root directory of any logical
disk accessed by it, in a hidden file called "WP_ROOT. SF". This file holds
specific information about setup of the desktop. It is updated after the
disk is accessed by any WPS object, such as the<I> Drives</I> folder.
<P>
EAs for the LAN independent shell are stored in the root directory of any
logical disk accessed through LAN utilities, such as the<I> LAN Server</I> folder,
in a hidden file called "WP_SHARE. SF". This file is updated when changes
are made to the logical disk by programs which make up the LAN independent
shell.
<P>
However, changes which are made to this disk from a WPS program are stored
in the "WP_ROOT. SF" file. For example, this would happen if a user accessed
the disk by issuing a "NET USE" command and then used the<I> Drives</I> folder
to work with it.
