<H1>The LAN Independent Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 124 -->
<P>
The LAN Independent shell is part of OS/2 V2.0 and an integral part of the
WPS. If you have one or more requesters started in your CONFIG.SYS, an icon
appears on the desktop labelled<I> Network</I>. Opening the<I> Network</I> folder
shows an icon for each network type, such as<I> LAN Server</I> or Novell
Netware**.
<P>
The objective of the LAN independent shell is make the use of LAN resources
as simple as possible while still giving users the information they require.
There is no longer any need for a user to switch to the full screen interface
of the LAN Requester to use LAN resources, they are now integrated into
the Workplace Shell
<P>
Access to the LAN is provided by a series of folders:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Network</I> folder on the desktop<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>LAN Server</I> folder(s) controlling the access
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>LAN Server(s)</I> structure within the network.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The LAN independent shell is loaded into the Workplace Shell when the LAN
Requester is installed. The system indicates to the user that the LAN resources
are available by displaying the<I> Network</I> icon. Any folders that the
user does not have access to are not displayed.
<P>
The<I> LAN Server</I> folder settings show whether a server can be accessed
with or without "login". <A HREF="030_L2_TreeViewoftheLANServ.html">Figure
"Tree View of the LAN Server"</A> shows the relationship of the<I> Network
</I>and<I> LAN Server</I> folders to the LAN servers and the available folders
within them. The LAN folder structure is similar to the structure on the
user's own local disk.
