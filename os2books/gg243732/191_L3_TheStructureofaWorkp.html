<H1>The Structure of a Workplace Shell Application</H1><!-- entering slot 206 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell has been implemented in such a way that the whole shell
and all its objects, be they system supplied or user developed, run as a
single OS/2 process. This has some very significant implications:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If an object abends for any reason, the whole shell
and all its objects crash, disrupting the user's work, and possibly resulting
in lost data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If a method of a Workplace Shell object takes too
long to complete its processing, the whole user interface will be locked
up until it completes.
<P>
This is a problem familiar to PM programmers, and as with PM, the solution
is to start a second thread for the long-running code.  Typical situations
where this problem can arise include retrieving data from a database or
communicating with a host system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->There is potential for data integrity problems, as
it is possible for all objects to access each others' data;  this is probably
more of a problem in theory than in practice, since most accidental addressing
errors will still result in "Trap" errors.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The recommended solution to these problems is to split an application into
two parts: one part, consisting of one or more WPS objects running in the
WPS process,  the other part containing most of the application logic running
as a separate OS/2 process.  The two parts communicate using the interprocess
communications (IPC) facilities of OS/2.
<P>
To avoid the problems above, it is best to put as little of the application
as possible into the WPS objects themselves.  Clearly some functions must
be there - for example the code to create and handle an object's context
menu, or to handle direct manipulation - and we have found it best also
to code PM dialog and window creation and their dialog and window procedures
within the WPS objects. Other application functions, such as database access,
communications and calculation, should be put in a separate process.
<P>
This structure approximates to the Model-View design approach favored by
object-oriented programmers. Our recommendation effectively places the<I> View
</I>in the WPS process and the<I> Model</I> in a separate process.
<P>
The Workplace Shell documentation provides no guidance on good and bad ways
of implementing an application using IPC between the shell process and the
application processing thread. <I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application
Development</I> includes a discussion of this and describes one approach
that has been tried, along with programming examples.
