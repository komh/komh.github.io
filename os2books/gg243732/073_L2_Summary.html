<P>
Presentation Manager provides the strategic graphical-based user interface
and programming environment for OS/2 Version 2.0.  The implementation of
Presentation Manager  under Version 2.0 has been significantly enhanced
over previous versions of OS/2 by exploiting the 32-bit application environment,
and by providing additional controls and functions. These can make development
more productive for the programmer and the interface more consistent for
the user.
<P>
The object-oriented Workplace Shell, which replaces the PM shell of previous
releases, implements the SAA CUA Workplace Model, both for itself and for
applications written to exploit the programming environment it provides.
 Such applications behave in a more intuitive manner, allowing the user
to spend less time learning system-specific operations and more time concentrating
on the work tasks to be performed.  The functions previously implemented
in desktop utilities have been combined within the Workplace Shell, insulating
the user from the complexities of the system.
<P>
A number of new Presentation Manager control windows and functions have
been added under Version 2.0, providing additional function to applications
and enhancing the flexibility of user dialogs by providing additional mechanisms
for displaying information and receiving user input.  Standard dialogs have
also been provided for common file and font manipulation functions, ensuring
SAA CUA conformance and removing the need for applications to include such
functions within the application code.
<P>
The Presentation Manager programming environment has changed very little
under OS/2 Version 2.0. Applications written and compiled for previous versions
will normally run with no changes. For applications to take full advantage
of the 32-bit environment and new Presentation Manager functions, some changes
to the source code are required, though these are mostly minor.
<P>
A new, object-oriented, programming model is introduced in the System Object
Model, which, in conjunction with the object classes supplied by the Workplace
Shell, enables application objects to be developed that integrate seamlessly
with the Workplace Shell. Applications written in this way can inherit useful
behavior from the supplied Workplace Shell object classes and add function
unique to the requirements of a user's business.
<P>
In general, Presentation Manager under OS/2 Version 2.0 provides improved
performance through the use of a 32-bit graphics engine and the Workplace
Shell provides improved usability. The redesigned shell with its more intuitive
interface helps to insulate the user from the inherent complexity of OS/2,
allowing the user to concentrate on the task being performed. The result
is improved productivity with reduced training requirements.
