<H1>Prevent Programs Restarting at IPL</H1><!-- entering slot 181 -->
<P>
On shutdown, a number of programs may be active which will be reactivated
at the next system IPL. A standard technique is available to override this.
It is described in the "README" file in the root directory. Press and hold
the left Ctrl, left Shift and F1 keys while the operating system is IPLing.
This disables the automatic program startup feature of the desktop.
<P>
This may not be appropriate for certain classes of user, for example where
several people share the system. These people would rather find the system
in a standard state each morning, regardless of what the previous user had
been running the day before. It is unlikely that an adminstrator in a corporate
environment would want his users to have to learn the Ctrl-Shift-F1 sequence.

<P>
A simple way to automatically prevent programs being restarted after an
IPL is to use a small REXX program to clear the<I> Startup</I> folder before
the Workplace Shell is activated. If this program is invoked from the STARTUP.CMD
file, it will run before the Workplace Shell is initialized to prevent previously
running programs from being started.
<P>

"A REXX Procedure To Prevent Programs Restarting."</A>
