<H1>Adding New File Types</H1><!-- entering slot 185 -->
<P>
The following REXX batch file presents a fully supported method of adding
types. It creates a new program reference plus the types associated with
that program reference. If the specified types don't exist then they are
added to OS2.INI. Afterwards, delete the program reference and the types
will remain.
<PRE>/* */
call RxFuncAdd "SysLoadFuncs", "RexxUtil", "SysLoadFuncs"
call SysLoadFuncs
call SysCreateObject "WPProgram", "Title", "&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;",
                     "EXENAME=EPM.EXE;ASSOCTYPE=Type 1, Type 2, Type 3,,"
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the call to SysCreateObject should only exist on one line in the
batch file, not on 2 lines as shown above. The two commas after the "Type
3" are intentional.
