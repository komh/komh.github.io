<P>
OS/2 V2.0 provides a number of standard, CUA-conforming dialogs which may
be used by applications to perform common operations such as file handling
and font selection.  The provision of these dialogs within the operating
system avoids the need for applications to individually develop dialog boxes
and procedures for these functions. This delivers a high degree of consistency
between similar operations in different applications.
<P>
Both forms of the standard file dialog are accessed by an application using
the<B> WinFileDlg()</B> function.  This function is explained further in
<I>OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
