<P>
The Workplace Shell is radically different from previous versions of OS/2.
 At first, it can make users of former versions of OS/2 feel insecure and
it takes some time to really appreciate the many advantages of the new interface.

<P>
OS/2 comes with a tutorial program that can help both experienced and new
users learn how to use the elements of the Workplace Shell. This is started
automatically once after the installation but can be called later at any
time.
<P>
The shell consists of an<I> electronic desktop</I>, on which are placed
various<I> icons</I>.  These icons represent objects such as folders, data
files, program references and physical devices.  The icon tells the user
about the object it represents. Some icons look like folders, while others
look like printers. Others may look like a book, a car or an order form.

<P>
It is important to understand that the symbols on the screen are just that.
 A symbol (or icon) may represent a real object or it may be a <A HREF="283_L2_shadowobject.html"><B>shadow
copy</B></A> of a real object. The icon provides no differentiation between
an object and its shadow copy, although description text of the shadow is
gray.
<P>
Deleting a shadow copy does not delete the real object. Therefore many large
customers may prefer that their users work with shadow copies to prevent
them accidentally deleting the real objects.
