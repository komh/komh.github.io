<H1>Opening a Window</H1><!-- entering slot 138 -->
<P>
The user may view the contents of an object by double-clicking on the icon.
 Two things then happen: the icon background changes to inform the user
that it is open, and a window appears with the contents displayed.  Most
objects also support different views; for example, a folder may have a<I> Details
</I>view, an<I> Icon</I> view and a<I> Settings</I> view where the user
may customize certain features.
<P>
A window in OS/2 V2.0 looks almost like any window in OS/2 Version 1.3,
except that there is a different icon (called the small icon, mini-icon
or title-bar icon) instead of the system menu icon.  This aids visual association
of the icon with the object on the part of the end user. This icon does
not, however, support the same drag and drop actions that can be performed
by using the icon on the desktop.  The "old" minimize button has been replaced
with a choice of a new minimize button (a small square) or a "hide" button.
 The maximize button is now a large square.
<P>
The user may also open a window by using its <A HREF="238_L2_contextmenu.html"><B>context
menu</B></A>; this menu is triggered by clicking mouse button 2.  The user
may then select the<I> Open</I> choice from the menu.

<P>
This results in a cascaded menu being displayed.  In the case of a folder
the user can typically choose to look at the<I> Settings</I>,<I> Details
</I>or<I> Contents</I> view of the object. This is an important characteristic
of the Workplace Shell; the ability to work with different views of the
same object helps the user to look beyond the windows and icons on the desktop
to see the underlying objects and their relationships to real-world objects.

<P>
The<I> Details</I> view looks similar to the OS/2 Version 1.3 File Managers
list style.  The<I> Icon</I> view is used by folders to show the objects
inside them.  All objects have a<I> Settings</I> view which is used to change
the objects' properties.
