<P>
A very important part of the object-oriented philosophy is that the user
does not load a program and subsequently create a file from the program.
 Instead, the user works with objects he creates by "cloning" from an existing
template. The Workplace Shell allows the user to create unique templates
for the different file layouts and use them with the same application. This
is discussed further in <A HREF="179_L3_SettinguptheUsersWor.html">Setting
up the Users Work Area</A>.

The templates folder contains several common templates like data files,
bit maps, folders, and icons which can serve as models for the user's objects.
 A template behaves like a pad of paper that you can drag a page off but
the pad never ends.

<B>Changes a User Can Make</B>
<P>
Users can create an object from the template that comes closest to the type
of object that is needed.  This object then can be modified to conform precisely
to the users' needs and made into a new template.
<P>
For example, a "data file" can be dragged from the data file template and
put into a work area. The file is then modified to the company memo layout
and the standard headings and text are entered. The modified object is then
made into a template from which new company memos can be created.

The administrator has to make sure that the program that is intended to
work with this template has the appropriate association.  Now, when an object
has been created from the template and has been named properly, a double
click on the object starts the program to work with that object.  <A HREF="029_L2_ExampleofaMenuShowin.html">Figure
"Example of a Menu Showing the Association"</A> shows an object derived
from a user template with a cascaded menu showing the association with a
program.
