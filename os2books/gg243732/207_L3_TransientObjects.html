<P>
The main difference between these programs and abstract objects is that
transient objects cannot save their state, that is, they are not "persistent".
Also pointers to transient objects are not stored in directory EAs, unlike
abstract objects. The values used when transient objects are started are
usually stored within the program and there is no mechanism to write these
back to disk. Examples of these programs include the window/task list and
device drivers.
