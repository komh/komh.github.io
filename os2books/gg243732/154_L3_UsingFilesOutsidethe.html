<H1>Using Files Outside the WPS Directory Structure</H1><!-- entering slot 163 -->
<P>
Setting up files to be used by the WPS where those files reside outside
the "OS!2 2.0 Desktop" directory structure may cause some problems. This
could apply, for example, to DOS programs which only look for files in a
specific directory. These files can still be placed on the desktop, however.
This is done by dragging a shadow copy of the file from the application
directory to the desktop, using the<I> Drives</I> folder.
<P>
However, the WPS does not receive every message from the file system concerning
files which lay outside its workplace directory structure (that is, not
under "OS!2 2.0 Desktop"). Notification is received if a new file is created
or if an existing file is deleted or renamed, but not if an existing file
is changed outside of the workplace. This lack of notification also applies
to file EAs created or modified for files in a non-workplace directory.

<P>
It is therefore always advisable to place all data files within the workplace
directory structure, where possible.
