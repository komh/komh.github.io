<P>
Within the Workplace Shell there are many folder and printer icons; one
for each folder or attached printer in the system. There are two issues
here: When we see multiple printers icons, do they refer to the same printer
or to different printers, and do they share the same code?
<P>
Multiple copies of folders refer to different folders but they all share
the same program. They are instances of the same folder class. Multiple
copies of printers may look similar but may actually be instances of different
printer classes.
<P>
To understand this, you have to understand something about the structure
of the Workplace Shell and the System Object Model (SOM) which it is built
on. Through inheritance, the System Object Model provides folders, work
areas and other types of container objects which share their common code
so the programmer only has to code the differences. SOM allows multiple
instances of each class to be created and manages the memory, pointers,
etc. for each of them. It also, through inheritance, allows instances of
different classes to be created which look the same and share a significant
degree of common code.
<P>
What happens when multiple instances of a data file are created depends
on the technique used to create the object. If you perform a copy, then
a new file and file EAs are created in the directory corresponding to the
folder which the file was created in. The file name and all the other details
are copied verbatim. Here, each copy is a new instance of the<I> WPDataFile
</I>class and can be modified without affecting the original file.
<P>
If you create the copies in the same directory as the original, however,
the operating system settings determine what happens when you try to copy
a file into a directory which already contains a file of that name. As a
default, the WPS will add a suffix to the file name and icon descriptive
text; for the first copy a "1" is added, for the second a "2", and so on.
The same thing happens if you create a copy in a different directory but
then drag it back into the original directory while the original file is
still there. This mechanism prevents you from accidentally overwriting copies
of your work, but it can be frustrating when you are trying to replace an
out-of-date version of a file.
<P>
You can also make multiple instances of the same file using the shadow copy
facility. Here, the shadow copy is an abstract object, stored as a HOBJECT
pointer in OS2.INI which points back to the original file. In both cases,
we have multiple instances of icons, but what the icons represent are instances
of different classes with different characteristics. Here, when you modify
the copy you are also affecting the original file.
