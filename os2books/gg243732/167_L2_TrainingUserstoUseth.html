<H1>Training Users to Use the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 178 -->
<P>
A good understanding of the basic concepts behind the workplace environment
will lead to greater user satisfaction and should help reduce their need
for support.
<P>
It is important that users understand not just the techniques used to interact
with the Workplace Shell, but also the objects that the WPS uses. They may
think that, since they make a copy of a file using Ctrl-drag but a shadow
copy using Ctrl-Shift-drag, then Ctrl-dragging a file will always make a
real copy, no matter what kind of object the source is. Of course, that's
not how the WPS works; if you copy a shadow, you get another shadow.
<P>
Shadows can cause other problems for the inexperienced user. For example,
if you have a user who wants to copy a file to a diskette, they will not
differentiate between the real file and a shadow, and will therefore fail
to understand why the WPS won't let them drag that shadow onto the diskette
icon. In general, it might be better to remove the diskette icon from the
desktop and let users work with the<I> Drives</I> folder for all their file
system interactions.
