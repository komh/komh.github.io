<H1>EAs for Files Used by DOS Programs</H1><!-- entering slot 162 -->
<P>
While the Workplace Shell uses file EAs extensively to store settings information
for File System objects, no DOS programs know how to handle them. This can
cause problems when a DOS program does not write the EA back to the disk
along with the file. Without its settings information, the file will lose
information such as a modified icon or the file type.
<P>
The problem occurs because many applications do not write back to the same
file they read from. Instead, the applications typically perform the following
actions:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->When the user selects "Open", the program:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Opens the original file and reads it into memory
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Closes the original file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Opens a new, temporary file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Lets the user edit, working with the copy in
memory.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>When
the user selects "Save", or "Autosave" is invoked, the program:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Writes from memory to the temporary file.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>When
the user selects "Exit", the program:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Closes the temporary file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Erases the original file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Renames the new file to the original filename.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Programs do this to reduce the likelihood of the original file being corrupted
if the system crashes. The problem is that if the application does not know
about EAs, then the above sequence will lose the EAs. All DOS and Windows
applications are affected by this, although the problem is more likely to
affect programs, such as word processors, which work with files rather than
those which work with records within a file, like data base programs.
<P>
To get around this, you could create a command file that would use EAUTIL
to split the EAs from the file, invoke the DOS application and then, when
the DOS application has finished, use EAUTIL to join the EAs back to the
file.
<P>
An alternative, though long-term, approach is replace DOS versions of these
programs with OS/2 versions, which will not have this problem.
