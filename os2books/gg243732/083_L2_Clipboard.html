<P>
The clipboard provides a temporary storage area for a piece of text, a bitmap
or a metafile. It enables the user to move data within a single application
or exchange data among applications.  Typically, a user selects data in
the application using the mouse or keyboard, then initiates a cut or copy
operation on that selection.  Using the paste command the user can insert
this data into another place in the same application or in another application.
 All these operations are performed by applications.
<P>
Generally an application should first verify that no other applications
are trying to retrieve or set clipboard data. Finally, when the application
finishes its access to the clipboard data, it releases the clipboard so
that other applications can use it.
<P>
These operations are described below:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL>Deletes the selected data from the application
and copies it to the clipboard.  Any previous contents of the clipboard
are destroyed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Copy</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Copies
the selected data to the clipboard.  The selection remains unchanged.  Previous
contents of the clipboard are destroyed.  Before an application performs
a<B> cut</B> or<B> copy</B> operation, it removes any previously stored
data in the clipboard. Then it writes its data to the clipboard in as many
standard formats as possible.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Paste</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Deletes
any selected data from the application and replaces it with the contents
of the clipboard. The contents of the clipboard are not changed. When the
application performs a<B> paste</B> operation it verifies the format where
the data are stored. If the clipboard contains one of the requested formats,
such as text data, the application gets a pointer to a shareable memory
object containing the text. For bitmap data or metafile, it gets a corresponding
handle.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The clipboard is a small amount of system memory for user-driven data exchange.
 The clipboard only stores pointers to data.  A set of API functions enables
the application to move and exchange data. <A HREF="010_L2_ClipboardCopyfromanO.html">Figure
"Clipboard Copy from an OS/2 Window into an OS/2 PM Editor"</A> is an example
of copying data from one application and pasting it to another, by way of
the clipboard.
<P>
The data in the clipboard is maintained in memory only.  Clipboard data
is lost when the computer is turned off.
