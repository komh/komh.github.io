<H1>The Workplace Shell and PM</H1><!-- entering slot 208 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell along with all its registered classes, be they system-supplied
or user-written, is itself just a Presentation Manager program.  As such
it should be able to cooperate quite well with other PM programs, as long
as it conforms to the protocols laid down by PM, particularly for drag and
drop.
<P>
The technical term for the drag/drop protocols is<I> Rendering Mechanisms</I>;
the standard ones are defined in the<I> OS/2 2.0 Programming Guide Volume
II</I>. The Workplace Shell implements the<I> Print</I> and the<I> OS/2
File</I> rendering mechanisms. These make it possible for a PM application
to provide direct manipulation printing capabilities and, if required, file
drag/drop facilities similar to those provided in the OS/2 Version 1.3 File
Manager.
