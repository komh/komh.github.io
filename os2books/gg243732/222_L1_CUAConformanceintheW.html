<H1>CUA Conformance in the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 246 -->
<P>
Some differences exist between the CUA architecture and the Workplace Shell
implementation in OS/2 V2.0. Some of these differences may force applications
to diverge from the CUA architecture, either because of the effort required
to override OS/2, or because of the negative impact to system consistency
or customization if the CUA guidelines are followed.
<P>
This is of particular importance for CUA<I> Fundamental</I> items, which
provide the foundation for many of the enhancements to CUA described in
the "CUA Vision" demonstration and video. Some of the discrepancies between
OS/2 and CUA are beyond the control of an individual application; under
these circumstances the application has no choice but to use the OS/2 conventions.

<P>
However, in other situations it is quite easy for an application to comply
with the CUA guidelines rather than following the example of OS/2. To aid
in this determination, an assessment of each OS/2 item has been made, and
the results are summarized in <A HREF="055_L2_FundamentalItems.html">Table
"Fundamental Items"</A>.
<P>
The same assessment has been made for non-fundamental (<I>Recommended</I>)
items in <A HREF="056_L2_RecommendedItems.html">Table "Recommended Items"</A>.
Again, where the OS/2 implementation does not force an application to differ
from the CUA architecture, the developer might simply use the OS/2 Workplace
Shell as an example. In such cases the product could just as easily follow
the CUA recommendations and should do so for improved consistency and ease
of use.
<P>
<I>OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I> provides several
examples of how to modify WPS objects and their behaviors, including subclassing
folders and changing their icon description. These examples should prove
useful to programmers who wish to implement CUA-conforming behaviors in
their OS/2 V2.0 applications.
<P>
The relevant page in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced
Interface Design Reference</I> is indicated in the Reference Page column
in both tables, together with an indication of which entry on that page
is being applied. Each page of the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture
CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I> contains a definition, a "When
to use" and a "Guidelines" section. The numbering scheme used refers to
the item number within a section; W is "When to use" and G is "Guidelines",
so 216/G2 is read as Page 216, second item in the Guidelines section.
