guard page exception
<P>
Operating system warning condition which occurs when an application accesses
memory within a page which has been declared as a guard page. This exception
may be trapped using an exception handler registered by the application
in order to handle such occurrances.  The typical processing performed by
the exception handler is to commit more memory within the memory object.
 If an exception handler is not registered, the operating system's default
handler commits the next available page within the memory object and sets
its attribute to PAG_GUARD.
