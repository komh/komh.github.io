<P>
This section discusses the main techniques used to navigate around the Workplace
Shell. The WPS supports user interaction through both mouse and keyboard
although it should be stressed that the WPS focus on direct manipulation
makes it much easier to use OS/2 V2.0 with a mouse than from the keyboard.
