<H1>Creating a Shadow Object</H1><!-- entering slot 141 -->
<P>
An interesting new feature is the ability to make <A HREF="283_L2_shadowobject.html"><B>shadow
copies</B></A> of existing objects which can be placed in different folders
or locations.  These shadow copies are linked to the original so that no
matter which copy is changed, all copies are automatically updated.  Links
between shadow objects are automatically maintained by the Workplace Shell.
 These links are sometimes referred to as <A HREF="276_L2_referencelink.html"><B>reference
links</B></A>.
<P>
The user may create a shadow copy from the icon's context menu or by holding
down the Ctrl and Shift keys while dragging the icon to the required destination.
 If a shadow is created in this way, the system draws a line between the
original and the shadow until the icon is released, so that the user knows
that a shadow copy, rather than a "normal" copy, is being created.
<P>
Program files should not be "shadowed" to a folder on the desktop. Instead,
a new reference for that program should be created within that folder. This
is done by opening the<I> Templates</I> folder and dragging a program object
to the folder you wish to run the application from. This is described in
the online reference documentation.
<P>
Using a program reference to the executable (.EXE) file means that, when
the user direct edits (Alt-mouse button 1) the icon description, he will
not change the name of the executable file. Changing the filename could
significantly confuse the Workplace Shell. This is also described in <A HREF="158_L3_ShadowCopiesofProgra.html">Shadow
Copies of Programs</A>.
