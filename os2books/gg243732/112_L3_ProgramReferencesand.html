<P>
Many of the items a user works with are program references and shadow copies
of objects.  This arrangement allows him to have objects in many places
and still use them as if the original was used.  The Workplace Shell supports
this concept through various functions like drag and drop, menu selections
and object settings.  The user has to make sure that this support system
is not violated through copies and deletions from the command line or from
a program.
