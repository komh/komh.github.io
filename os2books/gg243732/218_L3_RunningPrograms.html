<H1>Running Programs</H1><!-- entering slot 241 -->
<P>
When the operating system starts up it restarts any programs which were
running when the WPS stopped. The OS2.INI file contains the necessary information
to support this. For example, Figure "Running Programs Stored in OS2.INI"
shows several running programs.
<PRE>FolderWorkareaRunningObjects
        D:\OS!2 2.0 DESKTOP\OS!2_SYSTEM\COMMAND_PROMPTS
                WPProgram:A74A6.
        D:\OS!2 2.0 DESKTOP\OS!2_SYSTEM
                WPFolder:DCommand_Prompts.
                WPDrives:DDRIVES.

</PRE>
Running Programs Stored in OS2.INI 
<P>
The running programs can include programs and workplace objects, such as
folders and drives.
<P>
The above figure shows two open folders,<I> OS!2_System</I> and its subdirectory
<I>COMMAND_PROMPTS</I>. The running programs are stored together with their
location so that it is easier to reinstantiate the system as it was left.
Refer to the process of opening folders in <A HREF="203_L3_Folders.html">Folders
</A>to understand why this is so.
<P>
<B>Abstract Objects</B>
<P>
Each abstract object is also stored in the OS2.INI file so it can be located
using its reference. In the following example, we can see how a program
is stored with its instance data.
<PRE>PM_Abstract:Objects
        D98F
                ....WPShredder..#..p#...#......
                ....WPAbstract.......Shredder..
                ...........G.WPObject..........
                ...............................
                ..........&lt;WP_SHRED&gt;...........

</PRE>
Abstract Object Reference for Shredder in OS2.INI
<P>
This object is the WPS<I> Shredder</I>. It is stored with its Workplace
Shell class, OBJECTID, icon description and the classes it inherits from.
The hexadecimal pair, D98F, in the upper left corner is the HOBJECT of the
shredder. The location of each abstract object is also stored within the
folder section of OS2.INI, as can be seen in the example below.
<P>
<B>Folder Contents</B>
<P>
Folder contents are stored in two places; in the ICONPOS EA file for each
directory and in the OS2.INI file as shown below. Any running programs in
opened folders are stored under the<I> WorkAreaRunningPrograms</I> section
for reinstantiation during the OS/2 initialization, while the<I> FldrContent
</I>section below includes all the abstract object references in that folder.
These references are also stored, with their window coordinates, in the
ICONPOS.EA file of the directory associated with the folder.
<PRE>PM_Abstract:FldrContent
        5506
               0000  8FD9 0000 AB91 00 00
               0008  1C04 0000 1E7E 00 00
               0010  E13E 0000 22D5 00 00

</PRE>
Abstract Objects Contained in Folder 5506
<P>
The hexadecimal numbers are read as pairs, for example 8FD9 is actually
D98F. Each pair is a pointer to an abstract object (or program) in the system.
Here, we can see that the shredder (D98F) is referenced as the first item
in the folder. To help you read this, it is useful to know that<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->5506 is the HOBJECT for the folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->D98F is the HOBJECT of a WPAbstract instance contained
in this folder.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
<B>File Associations</B>
<P>
There are two association mechanisms in the OS2.INI file; one for association
filters and the other for association types. The format for association
types works with the information stored in the settings EAs for each file.
If a file doesn't have any EAs then the association is based on its full
or partial file name or extension, using the association filter.
<P>
There are two formats for the association filters, depending on whether
the program<!-- entering slot 242 --> runs in the WPS process or its own
process. These trigger the appropriate program when you double click on
a data file icon. The first filter, for any file with a<B> .MET</B> extension
(metafile), shows that two programs can be used. The first program is described
by an OS2.INI program reference (8134). The second program includes the
pathname and file name (PICVIEW.EXE).
<P>
The second filter, for a file with a<B> .ICO</B> extension (Icon), also
provides a program path and file name (ICONEDIT.EXE).
<PRE>PMWP_ASSOC_FILTER
       *.MET
         D:\OS!2 2.0 DESKTOP\OS!2_System\Productivity\WPProgram:A8134.
         D:\OS2\APPS\WPPROGRAMFILE:FPICVIEW.EXE.
       *.ico
         D:\OS2\APPS\WPPROGRAMFILE:FICONEDIT.EXE

</PRE>
Association Filters for File Extensions
<P>
The association type uses the same two formats as the filter; we can see
the program reference 8134 again for metafiles and ICONEDIT.EXE for bitmaps
in the figure below. File types are specified for each data file in its
Settings view. We can see five file types below:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Metafile<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Plain text<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->OS/2 command file<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Executable<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Bitmap.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

        Bitmap
                D:\OS2\APPS\WPPROGRAMFILE:FICONEDIT.EXE

</PRE>
Association Filters for File Types
<P>
When a user double-clicks on an icon for an object belonging to any of these
file types, the program associated with it is started. Note that there is
no association for executable files since they themselves are started. The
file name association takes precedence over the file type association if
both are specified for an object.
