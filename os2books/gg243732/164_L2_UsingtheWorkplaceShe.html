<H1>Using the Workplace Shell in a LAN Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 174 -->
<P>
The LAN independent shell in OS/2 V2.0 is an integral part of the WPS. If
you have one or more requesters started in your CONFIG.SYS file, an icon
labelled<I> Network</I> appears on the desktop. Opening the<I> Network</I> folder
shows an icon for each network type. A user can move or shadow the<I> Network
</I>folder to any other folder.
