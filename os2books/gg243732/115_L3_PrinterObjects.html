<H1>Printer Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 122 -->
<P>
Within the Workplace Shell, each possible print object is represented as
a separate printer icon.  The print object is composed of the printer queue
and the ports serviced by that queue.  However, the joint nature of the
printer object is not apparent to the end user, who sees<I> only</I> the
printer object, both when installing and when using a printer.  This removes
a major source of confusion with previous versions of OS/2.
<P>
Each printer object has an object name and is represented on the desktop
by an icon.  A user may direct objects to be printed by dragging and dropping
the required object over the printer object.
<P>
A printer object may be opened, and displays a window containing the name
and status of each print job currently in the queue, as shown in <A HREF="026_L2_JobListViewofPrintOb.html">Figure
"Job List View of Print Object"</A>.  The user may select any job and view
information on that job, hold or release the job in the queue, or discard
the job from the queue.  A printer object may be accessed for drag and drop
operations when opened, as well as in its closed icon state.
<P>
The printer object window includes a menu with items allowing the user to
view and alter properties of the printer object.  Selecting an option from
this menu causes a notebook control to be displayed, allowing the following
items to be viewed or altered:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Printer port used by the print object<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Name of the printer driver<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
In order to create a new printer object, a user may select the<I> Copy</I> option
which creates a new printer object identical to the current printer object.
 The desired properties may then be altered and the new object renamed to
reflect the changes.  For example,  the original may print "portrait," but
the copy can be changed to print "landscape" on the same printer.
<P>
For more information on printing, refer to<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume
5:  Print Subsystem</I>.
