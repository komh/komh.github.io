<H1>Training and Desktop Configuration</H1><!-- entering slot 179 -->
<P>
An important point to note here is that training for the WPS depends on
what objects are put onto their desktop; the greater the variety of objects,
the more the user has to know. Approaches to configuring the desktop are
discussed in <A HREF="169_L2_UtilitiesfortheWorkp.html">Utilities for the
Workplace Shell</A>.
<P>
Restricting the range of objects to devices, such as printers and shredders,
folders and data files is probably the best approach; it is very consistent
and requires the user to learn the least number of techniques. This is described
in <A HREF="177_L3_UserRequirements.html">User Requirements</A>.
<P>
Users with previous experience of using DOS or OS/2 will wish to continue
to use programs since that is how they already know how to work with a computer.
While the WPS is more logical, consistent and simpler than its "program
menu" predecessors, it is often difficult for some users to adjust to its
new style of interaction. Under these circumstances, modifying the shell
to look more like the PM shell in OS/2 Version 1.3 might be a better approach.
<A HREF="143_L2_GivingOS2V20theLooka.html">Giving OS/2 V2.0 the Look and
Feel of OS/2 Version 1.3</A> provides more information on this topic.
