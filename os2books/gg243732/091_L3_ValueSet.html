<H1>Value Set</H1><!-- entering slot 98 -->
<P>
The value set control is similar to the existing radio button control since
its purpose is to allow a user to select an item from an existing set.  However,
unlike radio buttons, the value set provides a graphical set of selectable
items. Suppose an application, like the one shown in <A HREF="015_L2_ValueSetControl.html">Figure
"Value Set Control"</A>, provides the ability to select a drawing tool.
Using the value set, the application can provide a graphical image of the
different tools so that the user can see all the available choices when
he makes his selection.
<P>
The value set control offers great flexibility to the interface designer
because it can be extended as the application grows. The system drag protocol
is supported by the value set control. This means that users could, for
example, select a color from a value set and then drag that color to the
target item. For example, he could drag the color to the client area of
a window to change that window's background color.
<P>
The items within a value set control may include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Bitmaps<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Icons<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Text strings<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Colors.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Items of different types may be mixed in the same value set control.
<P>
While a value set control may be used to display textual or numeric data,
it is recommended that a radio button be used for this purpose, and that
the use of the value set control be confined to the display of graphical
data.
