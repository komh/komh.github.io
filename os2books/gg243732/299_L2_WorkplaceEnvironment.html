Workplace Environment
<P>
User interface model for GUI systems under IBM 1991 Systems Application
Architecture Common User Access.  The Workplace Environment defines guidelines
for an interface where icons are manipulated using a mouse or keyboard,
to perform work tasks electronically in a way analagous to that in which
they would be performed manually.  Such an interface facilitates user training
and allows greater productivity through its intuitive nature.
