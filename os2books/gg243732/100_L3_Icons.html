<H1>Icons</H1><!-- entering slot 107 -->
<P>
Studies have shown that the human eye can identify and distinguish graphical
information more easily and effectively than textual information, and that
visual appeal is an important motivating factor in the workplace.  The Workplace
 Environment makes extensive use of icons to represent objects related to
user's work tasks.  Icons provide a very effective means of identifying
a required object, particularly where many possibilities are displayed to
the user.  Still it is advisable not to put too many icons into any workplace.
 Depending on the user, more than 10 to 20 icons in a given area may be
confusing.  A graphical environment encourages an orderly arrangement.
<P>
The icon is a two-dimensional depiction of the object.  It should resemble
the physical object it represents but it should also resemble what the user
<I>recognizes</I> as an object of that type.  For example, if the user expects
a printer to look like the one in <A HREF="019_L2_WorkplaceShellDeskto.html">Figure
"Workplace Shell Desktop Appearance"</A>, then an accurate portrayal of
an IBM 4029 Page Printer is not going to be easy for that user to recognize
and find; the user will have to read the title below the icons to locate
a printer.
<P>
A detailed discussion of these issues can be found in the<I> Icon Reference
Book, SC34-4348.</I>
<P>
The icon editor is part of OS/2.  The user can change the icon of any object
from its<I> Settings</I> view. The "General" page shows the current icon
and offers the option to edit that icon.  When "Edit" is selected, the Icon
Editor is invoked.
