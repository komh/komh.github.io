<H1>Setting Up Programs and Files</H1><!-- entering slot 160 -->
<P>
There are several issues associated with setting up programs and files.
Some of these issues, such as the physical location of programs and data,
are also discussed in <A HREF="164_L2_UsingtheWorkplaceShe.html">Using the
Workplace Shell in a LAN Environment</A>. This section discusses only those
issues which affect all programs and files across local and remote disks,
such as the use of Extended Attributes (EAs) and file associations.
