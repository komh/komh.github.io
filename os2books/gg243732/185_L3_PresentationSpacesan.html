<P>
A display window provides a view into a conceptual display surface known
as a presentation space. In terms of the above definition of a window, the
presentation space is actually the object upon which the window and its
window procedure operate. The contents of the presentation space represent
application data such as a document or graphical image. The application
places text and graphical items such as lines, arcs, and colors, in the
presentation space by means of PM API functions (the<I> GPI</I> functions).

<P>
The window therefore provides the user with a view of the presentation space,
using the screen.  This view may show the entire presentation space or only
a portion, depending on the size of the window and that of the presentation
space.  The size of the window is controlled by the user, although it is
limited by the physical size and resolution of the screen. The size of the
presentation space is controlled by the application and is limited by the
amount of available memory which may be used to contain the presentation
space.
<P>
A presentation space is usually created by a window procedure when a window
is created, and is associated with a<I> device context</I> at that time.

<P>
A device context relates a presentation space to a physical device such
as the screen or a printer, by converting the device-independent information
stored in the presentation space to a device-dependent form that can be
displayed on a particular device. If the contents of the presentation space
must later be drawn on a device other than that for which the presentation
space was initially created, the presentation space may simply be re-associated
with a different device context.  This may, for example, be done when a
graphical picture in a window on the screen needs to be printed.  The presentation
space that was originally associated with a screen device context is re-associated
with a printer device context.
