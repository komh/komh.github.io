16-bit
<P>
Term used to describe an application which uses the 16:16 addressing scheme
implemented under DOS and previous versions of OS/2.  In fact, such applications
use a 24-bit address since the segment selector and offset are normally
overlapped.  Such applicaitions typically use the 16-bit instruction set
implemented under the Intel 80286 processor.
