<H1>Programming Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 75 -->
<P>
The Presentation Manager programming environment under OS/2 Version 2.0
has changed very little from that provided under OS/2 Version 1.3.  Presentation
Manager applications written for previous versions of OS/2 will execute
without modification under Version 2.0.
<P>
A high degree of source code compatibility is also provided which allows
such applications to be recompiled for execution in a 32-bit environment,
 providing enhanced performance, with only very minor modifications in most
cases.
<P>
A number of new API functions have been added to Presentation Manager under
OS/2 Version 2.0, providing additional function to applications. These include
the<B> WinPopUpMenu()</B> function which allows the creation of context
menus and a number of other functions to simplify tasks such as checking
or unchecking menu items, that were previously achieved by means of PM messages,
some enhancement to the<I> Gpi</I> graphical functions, and some other minor
changes to function names etc.
<P>
A number of standard CUA-conforming dialogs for file and font manipulation
have been included within the operating system, removing the need for application
developers to write these commonly needed functions as part of their application
code.
<P>
Presentation Manager applications under OS/2 Version 2.0 may also mix 16-bit
and 32-bit executable modules, in the same way as other applications.  The
operating system provides a "thunk" layer for the PM APIs as it does for
the kernel APIs. Some additional considerations arise, however, when registering
windows between environments and when passing pointers as message parameters,
due to the difference in addressing schemes;  this is handled automatically
for the standard message classes. Functions are provided to enable programmers
to implement thunks for their user-defined messages classes. For a general
explanation of thunks see<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 1:  Control Program
</I>and for examples of their use see<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application
Development</I>.
<P>
In order to implement application objects that integrate fully with those
provided with the Workplace Shell one must write parts of one's application
in a new way, using the System Object Model.  The System Object Model provides
a language for defining object classes, their methods and instance data,
known as<B> Object Interface Definition Language</B> (OIDL) and some utility
programs to assist in the generation of the language source files that are
needed to build those object classes. Although currently only implemented
for the C language, the System Object Model has been designed to enable
object classes to be written in a variety of both object-oriented and non-object-oriented
languages.
<P>
All the object classes that the user sees when using Workplace Shell, such
as folder, data file and printer, are implemented internally as SOM classes
(wpFolder, wpDataFile, wpPrinter, etc.). By sub-classing these and other
Workplace Shell classes, programmers can develop new classes for the particular
needs of his users, inheriting<!-- entering slot 76 --> all the useful instance
data and methods while adding to or replacing them with those that their
new objects require.
<P>
Programming for the Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell environments
under OS/2 Version 2.0, including the use of the System Object Model and
the Workplace Shell classes, is described in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0
- Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
