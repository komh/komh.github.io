<P>
Some objects will disappear when the machine is rebooted, others will reappear.
The former are called "transient" objects in the WPS and the latter are
called "persistent" objects. Persistent objects are stored in the OS2.INI
file and directory EAs.
<P>
When you close a work area or shut down the desktop, any opened objects
are recorded in the OS2.INI file and restarted next time the desktop or
work area is reopened. Persistence for all WPS objects, such as the system
clock, programs and shadow copies, is handled by their classes.
<P>
The OS2.INI file implementation is critical to the WPS because it represents
a single point of focus for the entire operating system. If it becomes corrupted
the system will lose all the information about how to run programs, the
associations between files and programs and which programs were previously
running in the system.
