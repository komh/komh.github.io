<P>
Perhaps the most common source of problems associated with OS/2 V2.0 is
the failure to run the "shutdown" program before powering off the machine.
"Shutdown" closes the system down methodically, giving all running programs
an opportunity to save their data. It also writes the contents of the disk
cache to disk if the<I> lazy write</I> option was set in HPFS.
<P>
Therefore, not shutting the system down methodically can result in system
and application data being corrupted on the disk. This is especially troubling
if the OS2.INI file becomes corrupted, since this file contains pointers
to all the objects used by the WPS.
