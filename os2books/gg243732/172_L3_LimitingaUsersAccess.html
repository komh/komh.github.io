<P>
This requires a Workplace Shell program to be written.<I> OS/2 Version 2.0
- Volume 4:  Application Development</I> provides some information on subclassing
WPS objects which will be needed to accomplish this. The general approach
is to subclass the object class and create a new one which doesn't allow
access to settings, then remove the "Settings" choice from the context menu.
