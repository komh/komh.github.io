<H1>Shadows</H1><!-- entering slot 227 -->
<P>
Shadows are "aliases" for objects. Both<I> WPProgram</I> and<I> WPFileSystem
</I>objects can be "shadowed" but it is not recommended to make shadow copies
of programs. This is because a user might mistakenly edit the program title
of the shadow copy and change the original program's filename, thus preventing
it from being executed.
<P>
The behavior of a shadow is identical to the object it shadows in all respects
except one; deleting a shadow does not affect the source object. In practice,
the user may find other differences; for example, deleting an object causes
the deletion of all its shadows. Shredding an object which has shadows linked
to it will generate a message window, informing the user that this object
has shadows associated with it.
<P>
Distinguishing a shadow icon from an object icon can be difficult, as there
is only a subtle visual distinction between objects and their shadows (the
text of a shadow is "grayed" or "dimmed"). Some users find it difficult
to distinguish such a subtle difference and they should modify the shadow
color text using the<I> Scheme Palette</I> within the<I> System Setup</I> folder.
Shadows are also differentiated from real objects by the presence of the
"Original" choice at the bottom of their context menus.
