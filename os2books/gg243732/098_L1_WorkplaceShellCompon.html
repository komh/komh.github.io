<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides an improved user shell, that is, the component
of the operating system which is responsible for the appearance and behavior
of the user interface.  This shell is based upon the 1991 IBM Systems Application
Architecture (SAA) Common User Access (CUA) Workplace Environment, and is
known as the <A HREF="300_L2_WorkplaceShell.html"><B>Workplace Shell</B></A>.

<P>
One of the historical drawbacks of the OS/2 environment has been the power
and therefore the complexity of the operating system.  Much of this complexity
has, in the past, been allowed to transfer itself to the user interface,
thus often requiring a large amount of user effort to complete a task.
<P>
The objective of the Workplace Shell is to simplify and facilitate the performance
of work tasks by an end user through the use of graphics and the direct
manipulation of icons on the screen.  The Workplace Shell aims to insulate
the end user from the complexity of the OS/2 operating system, requiring
less effort to complete a particular task, thereby reducing the level of
knowledge and experience required for the user to successfully manipulate
the system.

<P>
In addition, the Workplace Shell provides a more consistent user interface
by implementing the additional control window classes and standard CUA functions
provided under OS/2 V2.0, thereby easing the task of working with multiple
applications concurrently, and of learning new applications.
