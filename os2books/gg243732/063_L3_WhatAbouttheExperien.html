<H1>What About the Experienced PC User?</H1><!-- entering slot 66 -->
<P>
Although the Workplace Shell can provide the inexperienced user with this
ideal working environment requiring no knowledge of how OS/2 works, there
are many users who are already quite comfortable with basic computing concepts.
These users could feel frustrated if they were denied the ability to access
the files, directories and programs with which they are familiar.
<P>
The Workplace Shell does not prevent this.  For example, it provides the
<I>Drives</I> object, offering similar function to the file managers of
OS/2 Version 1.3 or Microsoft Windows**. The<I> Program Reference</I> object
class provides a way to install and run ordinary - non-Workplace Shell -
programs.  OS/2 and DOS command prompts may be invoked, allowing the use
of commands some of which date back over 10 years to the first releases
of DOS.  Workplace Shell is also so flexible that a user can set it up to
look and behave very much like OS/2 Version 1.3 or Windows, if that is what
is preferred.
<P>
So, experienced PC users may find the Workplace Shell unfamiliar at first,
and may not even fully understand the point of it, but they have the option
of working in whatever way they choose - using a command prompt if they
want to, or perhaps an interface similar to OS/2 Version 1.3 or Windows.
In time, they may learn to to think in a less computer-oriented way and
start using the additional productivity features of the Workplace Shell.
