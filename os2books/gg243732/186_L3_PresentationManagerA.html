<H1>Presentation Manager API Enhancements in OS/2 V2.0</H1><!-- entering slot 199 -->
<P>
The 32-bit Presentation Manager API remains largely unchanged in OS/2 V2.0,
though there are a number of new functions, mostly to help the programmer
rather than adding significant new function.  For a complete review of the
changes and enhancements, see<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Application Design
Guide</I>, which includes a chapter comparing 16-bit and 32-bit OS/2 functions,
including a section covering Presentation Manager.  The following section
is a summary of that information.
<P>
<B>Functions Removed</B>
<P>
A number of 16-bit PM functions are not included in the 32-bit set.  In
most cases these have been replaced by new 32-bit functions, or are no longer
appropriate with the new shell.  Areas affected are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Heap management functions<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Program list (group windows)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<BR>

<P>
<B>Printing</B>
<P>
All the printing functions, which previously had names with the prefix<I> DosPrint</I>,
have been renamed to use the prefix<I> Spl</I>.
<P>
<B>Workplace Shell</B>
<P>
A number of new functions have been introduced giving PM programs an interface
to the shell. These include, for example, the<B> WinRegisterObjectClass()
</B>and<B> WinCreateObject()</B> functions, which allow a program to register
and create Workplace Shell objects. The self-explanatory<B> WinShutDownSystem()
</B>function provides a capability that was missing in previous releases.

<P>
<B>Dynamic Data Facility</B>
<P>
These new functions, which have the function name prefix<I> Ddf</I>, are
intended to be used by programs that provide IPF text dynamically at run
time. Such programs receive messages from IPF when they are to display their
information, at which time they must build and display the text requested.

<P>
The DDF functions enable the program to format the text into paragraphs,
lists and headings in such a way that it can easily be reformatted when
the window is resized.  Functions are provided to allow the creation of
hypertext links, references to bitmap data, and to specify what sort of
text formatting is required (left or right justification, for example).

<P>
<B>Standard Font and File Dialogs</B>
<P>
Many applications offer their users the option of loading and saving files
from and to disk, and CUA defines the dialog that should be presented to
the user so that he can select the appropriate disk, directory and file
to use.  The standard file dialog function,<B> WinFileDlg()</B>, implements
this dialog with very little programming effort.
<P>
The standard font dialog, invoked by means of the<B> WinFontDlg()</B> function,
does the same for those applications that allow font selection.
<P>
These dialogs, which are also discussed in <A HREF="086_L1_NewPresentationManag.html">New
Presentation Manager Features</A>, significantly improve programmer productivity
when file or font selection facilities are required.  They also ensure that
the dialogs used by different applications present a totally<!-- entering slot 200 --> consistent
user interface.
<P>
<B>New Window Classes</B>
<P>
OS/2 V2.0 introduces several new control window classes, which are described
in <A HREF="086_L1_NewPresentationManag.html">New Presentation Manager Features</A>,
along with some corresponding new messages.
<P>
<B>Graphics Functions</B>
<P>
A number of new GPI functions are provided, mostly related to the use of
fonts and characters.
<P>
<B>PM Helper Macros</B>
<P>
A set of helper macros is provided that simplify interaction with some of
the more commonly used  control window classes. The use of the macros can
reduce the need explicitly to send messages to such windows for simple tasks
such as inserting an entry into a list box, or querying the state of a checkbox.

<P>
Being macros, these functions are expanded by the C pre-compiler into PM
calls to send the relevant messages so, although they are coded as functions,
no type-checking will be applied by the compiler to the arguments.
