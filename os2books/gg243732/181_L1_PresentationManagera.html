<H1>Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell Application Development</H1><!-- entering slot 192 -->
<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 introduces a new choice for application developers: whether
to develop their applications using traditional PM programming techniques
or to use the System Object Model (SOM) interfaces and the Workplace Shell
class hierarchy to develop fully-integrated applications.
<P>
This chapter provides an overview of the two programming models, and discusses
the extent to which it is possible to integrate a PM program into the Workplace
Shell environment.
<P>
For more detailed information on programming for Presentation Manager and
for the Workplace Shell, see<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application
Development</I>.
