<P>
Presentation Manager applications revolve around the concept of <A HREF="298_L2_windows.html"><B>windows</B></A>.
 A window appears as a rectangular area on the screen, in which information
may be displayed and user input entered.
<P>
An application may create multiple windows, and multiple windows created
by one or more applications may be displayed concurrently on the screen.

<P>
While the Presentation Manager interface is graphics-oriented, the information
input and output through a window need not be graphical; text may be manipulated
in windows without the complication of using graphics fonts.  While a mouse
is recommended for user interaction in the Presentation Manager  environment,
many Presentation Manager  functions can be achieved by the use of the keyboard
only.
<P>
Windows are displayed on the screen overlaying a background known as the
<A HREF="241_L2_desktop.html"><B>desktop</B></A>. This desktop may be altered
to any color, or a bitmapped image may be displayed, using utilities provided
with Presentation Manager as part of OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
An application may create multiple windows; the desktop may simultaneously
display multiple windows created by multiple applications, and these windows
may be updated concurrently by their parent applications, due to the multitasking
nature of the OS/2 operating system.  However, since OS/2 is a<I> single-user
</I>system, the user provides input to only one window at a time.  This
window is said to possess the<B> input focus</B>. The user may switch the
input focus from one window to another by pointing to the desired window
with the mouse and pressing mouse button 1, or with the keyboard using the
Ctrl+Esc or Alt+Esc key combinations.
<P>
The use of the mouse button depends on whether the user is left- or right-handed.
 It can be selected during the installation process of OS/2 Version 2.0.
In this document we conform to the CUA convention of using mouse button
1 (MB1) for "select" and mouse button 2 (MB2) for "drag" functions. More
information on this is provided in <A HREF="123_L2_WPSNavigationandTech.html">WPS
Navigation and Techniques</A>.
<P>
When many windows are displayed on the desktop at one time, the desktop
can become cluttered and almost unworkable. To avoid this situation and
remove unwanted windows from the screen without terminating their associated
applications, Presentation Manager allows the user to<B> minimize</B> a
window. When a window is minimized, it is removed from the desktop and its
<B>icon</B> is placed in the<I> Minimized Window Viewer</I> folder. See
<A HREF="082_L2_Icons.html">Icons</A> for a further discussion of this.

<P>
Clicking MB2 on an icon causes Presentation Manager to display a context
(or pop-up) menu. This lets the user restore, move or close the window (that
is, terminate the application). If the user "double clicks" MB1 on the icon,
Presentation Manager will restore the window to its previous size and position
on the screen, without displaying the menu.
<P>
In order to display a window to the full size of the display screen, a user
may<B> maximize</B> a window.  The window is then resized to the maximum
defined by the program.  For some programs this will be the whole screen.
 A window may also be restored to its former size and position on the screen.
See <A HREF="076_L3_FrameArea.html">Frame Area</A> for a description of
the way in which this is achieved.
<P>
A window on the screen consists of two distinct areas; the<B> frame</B> area
and the<B> client</B> area.  The frame area allows the user to manipulate
the window (that is, resize the window, move the window on the screen, etc.)
while the client area is used by the application to display information
and solicit user input.
