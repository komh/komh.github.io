<P>
The progress indicator displays the progress of a long-running command to
the user.  It is typically used for operations such as uploading or downloading
files to or from a remote system, backing up a fixed disk etc.  The progress
indicator provides an easy way for different applications to display such
progress to the end user in a consistent manner.

<P>
The progress indicator includes push buttons which allow the user to control
the operation in progress. The user may pause or resume the operation; the
operation may be cancelled when in the paused state. The progress indicator
control passes messages to the application when the user selects any push
button.
