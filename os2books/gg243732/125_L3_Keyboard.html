<P>
Though the graphical interface encourages the use of a mouse, the keyboard
is still the main data entry device.  Once much of the work is done using
the keyboard in applications like word processing the user may find the
keyboard much faster and easier to use than the mouse.
<P>
Besides the convenience aspect, some users may have a special need to operate
OS/2 from the keyboard.  This may be helpful for handicapped people or in
a certain environment where two or more keys cannot be depressed at the
same time.  This is supported by the so-called<I> sticky keys.</I>  The
sticky keys allow the use of several keys in a sequence instead of pressing
them at the same time.
<P>
Take, for example, a user who needs to press Alt+F5. With the sticky keys
that can be done using one hand and pressing the keys sequentially within
a time frame which can be set in the System Setup function.
