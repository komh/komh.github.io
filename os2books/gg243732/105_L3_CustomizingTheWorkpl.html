<H1>Customizing The Workplace Shell Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 112 -->
<P>
The user may want to place the most frequently used objects in a way that
is most comfortable for him. Furthermore, the user may want to add or change
colors. Some of these requirements are supported on a global scale, others
on an individual object basis.
<P>
There are a few settings that are general to all applications. They can
be found within the<I> OS2 System</I> folder under <A HREF="021_L2_SystemSetup.html"><I>System
Setup</I></A>
<P>
<B>Colors</B>
<P>
A Color Palette and a Scheme Palette can be set for later use in modifying
the appearance of windows.  Included in the Color Palette is the setting
for the border width.  The information is stored in OS2.INI and can be changed
easily for the whole system.
<P>
<B>Font Palette</B>
<P>
The palette of fonts available in the system can be changed by adding or
deleting fonts.  Certain display attributes like underlining and bold display
can be set from here.  Items can be dragged from the palette and dropped
on the desired object(s).
<P>
<B>Mouse</B>
<P>
Quite a number of settings are available to control the behavior of the
mouse buttons.  Changing them, however, may cause trouble if more than one
person is using the system.
<P>
<B>Keyboard</B>
<P>
Timing, special needs (see <A HREF="022_L2_KeyboardSettingsNote.html">Figure
"Keyboard Settings Notebook"</A>) like sticky keys, and the mapping of the
function keys are defined in this selection.
<P>
<B>Sound</B>
<P>
This variable can be used by an application to find out if beeps are generally
wanted.  It does not stop an application from generating sound output.<B> Clock
</B>
<P>
The system clock can be displayed and various settings can be altered.
<P>
<B>Country</B>
<P>
The installation determines the settings like language group, keyboard,
date and time formats. They can be changed at any time.
