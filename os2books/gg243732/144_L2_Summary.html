<P>
This chapter discussed many of the techniques supported by the Workplace
Shell.
<P>
The primary navigation techniques which let the user work with those objects
are slightly different from those used by Presentation Manager V1.3, but
are at the same time more consistent. The emphasis on direct manipulation
helps provide much of this enhanced consistency but enforces the need for
a user to have a mouse if he is to perform many basic tasks.
<P>
The new WPS objects and techniques offer greatly increased flexibility for
organizing work to suit the user. These objects can be rearranged to provide
new ways of doing the kinds of activities most users are familiar with.
In particular, direct manipulation allows users to perform activities with
greater ease, and better feedback, than before.
<P>
The Workplace Shell makes OS/2 V2.0 much easier to "personalize" than previous
versions of OS/2. Users can easily change one object, the whole system and
even the menus of individual items. The shell can even be made to look like
OS/2 Version 1.3 to suit the preferences of those users who are not yet
ready to tackle an object-oriented user interface.
