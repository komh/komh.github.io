<P>
The Presentation Manager user interface provides the capability for the
user to interact with applications in a consistent, intuitive manner. Presentation
Manager components conform to the guidelines laid down in the<I> IBM Systems
Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User Interface Design</I>.

<P>
The Presentation Manager user interface makes extensive use of windows and
a series of defined user interface constructs which appear and behave in
a consistent manner, and which may be used by applications to interact with
the user.  Special-purpose windows such as dialog boxes and message boxes
are also supported by the interface for use in specific circumstances, and
their appearance and behavior is also defined and regulated by CUA guidelines.
 The use of such predefined constructs by applications allows a high level
of consistency between applications in terms of their interaction with the
user, thus simplifying the level of training required to use those applications.

<P>
The event-driven, object-action style of the user interface implemented
by Presentation Manager is highly intuitive. This fact, combined with the
high level of consistency between applications, encourages learning by exploration.
In turn, this helps reduce the need for formal training and enables users
to become more productive with new applications in a shorter period of time.
