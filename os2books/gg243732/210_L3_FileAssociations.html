<H1>File Associations</H1><!-- entering slot 232 -->
<P>
Files are associated with their "file handler" in two ways. The<I> Settings
</I>view for an executable file contains an<I> Association</I> page. This
page allows an application to be associated with its data file. The association
can be by file type or by full or partial file name and extension.
<P>
The file type, file name, partial file name or file extension (for example
WP*, WP*.DOC, *.DOC) can be associated with a program from the program itself
or the program reference. The file type (for example, OS/2 command file
or plain text file) can be associated with a program using the<I> Settings
</I>view for an object. Both sets of information are stored in the OS2.INI
file. See <A HREF="217_L2_TheOS2INIFile.html">The OS2.INI File</A> for further
details.
<P>
A data file that "belongs" to an application will reflect this by having
the application's name appear as a view that can be opened. Plain text files,
for example, may be opened as a "System Editor" view. The<I> Association
</I>page is available for command (CMD) files as well as executable (EXE)
files.
<P>
This duplication can cause confusion to the user if the associations are
set in all three places. We recommend that if you have a program reference
for a program, use this to set the associations instead of setting the associations
from the program object itself.
