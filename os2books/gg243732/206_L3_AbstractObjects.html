<P>
These include program references and shadow copies of files. Some can be
programs written and executing within the Workplace Shell, others can be
application programs running in their own processes while others can be
shadow copies of data files. Since all objects have to have a program running
behind them somewhere, there are many of these objects in the system, stored
in the OS2.INI file.
<P>
The system clock is an example of a program running in the WPS process,
while the icon editor is an example of a PM program running in its own process
outside the WPS. Shadow copies are discussed in <A HREF="205_L3_Shadows.html">Shadows</A>.

<P>
Since<I> WPAbstract</I> objects only physically exist in the OS2.INI file,
they cannot be copied to diskette. This may confuse some users, who think
that dragging a program reference or shadow copy to a diskette will cause
the real file to be copied.
<P>
Information about<I> WPAbstract</I> objects is held in the OS2.INI file.
 For more information refer to <A HREF="217_L2_TheOS2INIFile.html">The OS2.INI
File</A>.
