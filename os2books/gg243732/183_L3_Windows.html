<H1>Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 194 -->
<P>
Presentation Manager applications are based upon the concept of <A HREF="298_L2_windows.html"><B>windows</B></A>.
 A window typically represents some object, such as a file or document,
a device or a data record, upon which the application will operate.  The
user interacts with the window to manipulate the object.
<P>
A window appears to the user as a rectangular area on the screen, which
may be moved and re-sized by the user with either the keyboard or mouse.
 From an application viewpoint, however, the concept of a window is far
more powerful than this.  Windows may be of two basic types:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Display windows</B> have a visual manifestation
represented by a rectangular area on the screen; in this case, the window
represents a view of a conceptual display surface known as a<B> presentation
space</B>, which is the object upon which the window operates.  This view
may be full or partial, depending upon the current size of the window, and
the size of the presentation space.  See <A HREF="185_L3_PresentationSpacesan.html">Presentation
Spaces and Device Contexts</A> for more information on presentation spaces.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><B>Object windows</B> have no visual manifestation,
and are merely addresses or "handles" to which messages may be directed.
 An object window is typically associated with an object such as a file
or database, and is used to access this object and perform actions upon
it.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Windows respond to events which are communicated to them by way of<B> messages</B>.
 Messages may originate from Presentation Manager as a result of user interaction,
or from other windows in the system.  Messages may be of many different
types; Presentation Manager defines a number of<B> message classes</B>,
and an application may define its own message classes for communication
between its own windows.  Messages are routed between windows by Presentation
Manager on behalf of the applications, and are discussed in greater detail
in <A HREF="184_L3_Messages.html">Messages</A>.
<P>
The basic structure of a Presentation Manager application is therefore that
of a group of windows, communicating with one another by way of messages.
 This is illustrated in <A HREF="043_L2_PresentationManagerA.html">Figure
"Presentation Manager Application Structure"</A>.
<P>
The behavior of a window in response to messages directed to it is determined
by its<B> window procedure</B>, which determines the processing performed
by the window in response to each message it receives.  Windows with similar
characteristics are grouped into a<B> window class</B>, and share a window
procedure.
<P>
Note that windows are a finite operating system resource.  Under OS/2 Version
1.1 and Version 1.2, the maximum number of windows which could be created
in the system was approximately 1200.  Under OS/2 Version 1.3 this limit
was increased to approximately 10000; this increased limit also applies
to OS/2 Version 2.0.
<P>
Other Presentation Manager objects such as presentation spaces and device
contexts also consume storage for control information.  Under OS/2 Version
2.0, the total limit for all graphics resources used by Presentation Manager
is approximately 64000.
<P>
Note also that when large numbers of windows are created in the system,
Presentation Manager uses significant processor resource to handle message
routing, clipping etc. Some degradation in overall system performance may
therefore be experienced when running with an extremely large number of
windows open.
<P>
<B>Window Classes</B>
<P>
Each window belongs to a window class.  The window class determines a number
of properties of the window, including its window procedure, which in turn
determines the behavior of the window in response to the messages it receives.
 A window class is registered with Presentation Manager, and may be defined
in one of two ways:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Public</I>, in which case the window class is registered
automatically at system initialization, and may be used by any application
in the system.
<P>
A number of window classes, such as the frame window and control windows,
are publicly defined by Presentation Manager, and are hence available for
use by applications.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><I>Private</I>, in which case an application must
register the window class explicitly during its own initialization.  Windows
of this class may<!-- entering slot 195 --> then be used only by that application.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each window within a class is said to be an instance of that class. Multiple
windows of the same class may exist in the system at the same time, controlled
by the same or different applications.
<P>
<B>Window Procedures</B>
<P>
Each window in the system has a window procedure, which defines the processing
performed by the window for each message it receives.  Such processing may
include general application logic, I/O operations or communication with
other windows.  The window procedure is associated with an entire window
class rather than an individual instance of the class, and is defined when
the class is registered to Presentation Manager.
<P>
The window procedure must be provided by the application which registers
the window class.  Presentation Manager provides its own window procedures
for its publicly defined window classes.  Applications which register their
own window classes must provide a window procedure for each class.
<P>
The window procedure is invoked by Presentation Manager on the application's
behalf, in response to any message directed to that window, either from
Presentation Manager itself or from another window in the system.  The window
procedure determines the class of the message, and takes appropriate action.
 Since there are an extremely large number of messages which may be passed
to a window, the window procedure need only process those messages which
are required to carry out the window's functions; Presentation Manager  provides
default processing for all system-defined message classes, and application-defined
message classes not processed by the window procedure are simply ignored.

<P>
Window procedures are re-entrant, and multiple instances of the same window
class share the same memory-resident copy of the window procedure.  Hence
any local data defined by the window procedure is also shared by each window
in the class.  To allow each window to keep its own separate data areas,
Presentation Manager allows an application to define an area known as the
<B>window words</B>, which is unique to each individual window, and is maintained
with Presentation Manager's own control block for that window.  Window words
are normally used to store a pointer to a memory object which is dynamically
allocated when the window is created, and used to store instance-specific
data.
