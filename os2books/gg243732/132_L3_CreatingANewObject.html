<H1>Creating A New Object</H1><!-- entering slot 140 -->
<P>
To create a new object, the user can either use a template or simply make
a copy of an existing object and change it.  Templates may be regarded as
pads of blank forms; the user simply "peels off" a new instance of an object
such as a folder.  The Workplace Shell creates a new icon of the requested
type, which the user can then customize using the<I> Settings</I> view.

<P>
To make a copy of an existing object, the user may either bring up a context
menu and select the<I> Copy</I> choice from it, or use the<I> Create-on-drag
</I>function by holding down the control key while dragging the icon to
the required destination.
