<P>
Program files should not be "shadowed" to a folder on the desktop. Instead,
a new reference for that program should be created within that folder. This
prevents the user from writing over the name of the executable file if he
directly edits (Alt-MB1) the icon description. Consistently applying this
technique will also reduce the number of cross references within the OS2.INI
file and enhance the reliability of the WPS.
