<H1>The OS2.INI File</H1><!-- entering slot 240 -->
<P>
This is the most important file in the Workplace Shell. It is the only place
where information about<I> WPAbstract</I> objects, including which folder(s)
they can be found in, is stored. The need for sensible backup and recovery
mechanisms for OS2.INI is discussed in <A HREF="145_L1_InstallingandSupport.html">Installing
and Supporting the Workplace Shell</A>.
<P>
Because it is the only place in OS/2 V2.0 where<I> WPAbstract</I> objects
are stored, the Workplace Shell is limited to those<I> WPAbstract</I> objects
defined within the OS2.INI in the root directory. That is, the Workplace
Shell user cannot see any<I> WPAbstract</I> objects defined on a server,
even if he can access the entire disk and desktop structure of that server.

<P>
The OS2.INI file uses its own data structure and cannot be edited by an
ordinary text editor, so if anything goes wrong you will probably have to
reinstall OS/2 Version 2.0. Taking a backup of the OS2.INI file is highly
recommended. Running MAKEINI.EXE is a possibility, but this will only restore
the OS2.INI file to the state it was in when it was originally installed
and any subsequent customization will be lost. These approaches may result
in HOBJECT pointers in the directory EAs being different from those in OS2.INI,
leading to a condition known as "unresolved abstracts".
<P>
The OS2.INI file includes the following information:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
