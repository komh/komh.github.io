<P>
In a shell with as many objects as the Workplace Shell, it is almost inevitable
that some of the windows may contain elements which do not comply with CUA
guidelines. Application developers should not assume that these elements
and their behaviors are sanctioned by CUA; they should continue to implement
objects and behaviors which conform to the rules laid out in the<I> IBM
Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Interface Design Reference</I>.

<P>
This section provides a few examples of non-compliant behaviors in the following
areas:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
