<P>
In looking at how the Workplace Shell is implemented, it is useful to separate
the shell from the underlying workplace facilities, since the same facilities
are needed by both the shell and by all applications which run under the
shell.  These facilities include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Object registration<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->File associations<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Direct manipulation<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Icon interaction/messaging<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The ability to create multiple instances of objects.

<P>
These functions are implemented as WIN APIs which can be accessed from any
language that has appropriate bindings. For example, "WinCreateObject" can
be called from a C program. Some of these APIs, such as "SysRegisterObjectClass",
have been mapped to a new version of REXX,
<P>
One of the most important points to make here is that, from an application's
viewpoint, the WPS can be totally invisible provided the application only
uses objects which are already defined in the WPS class hierarchy, such
as data files. For example, templates for data files can be created and
associated with the program.
<P>
Applications written for previous versions of OS/2 may take advantage of
the basic functions supported by the class under which they are registered
(typically<I> WPProgram</I>). For instance, a program can be started by
dropping a data file on the program icon providing the program will accept
a file name as a parameter.
