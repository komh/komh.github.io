<H1>The Vision</H1><!-- entering slot 63 -->
<P>
Those who have worked with computers for many years are very happy to talk
about files, programs, directories, records, spoolers, etc. The inexperienced
computer user is not. We are used to the idea that when editing a document
we must first load the data from disk into memory and later, when we have
finished editing it,  save it back onto disk.  The new computer user is
not.
<P>
While we are using a computer we can visualize what is going on in the computer
- programs being loaded into memory, print files being written to disk before
being printed, and the whole hierarchy of disks, directories and files.
 The user interface, for us, is a means by which we control these processes.
 There have been good user interfaces and bad user interfaces, but so far
they have all been designed to allow the knowledgeable user to control a
system he understands to some degree. Becoming proficient in the use of
a personal computer meant understanding what it does internally.
<P>
With Presentation Manager and the Workplace Shell a new user can enjoy much
of the function of OS/2 and its applications, without needing to understand
these things.  He does not even need to think of what he sees on the screen
as an interface - that would imply that he is aware that there is something
beyond it to which he is interfacing. What he sees on the screen is all
he needs to know about.  And what he sees there are representations of everyday
items such as folders, documents, an alarm clock, a shredder, and printers.

<P>
These items - known as <A HREF="268_L2_object.html"><I>objects</I></A> and
represented on the screen by little images known as <A HREF="256_L2_icon.html"><I>icons
</I></A>- behave in familiar ways; for example to destroy a document a user
would probably guess that he had to put it through the shredder.  With Workplace
Shell this is almost exactly what he would do - using the mouse he would
drag the icon representing the document onto the icon representing the shredder.
 Having discovered that, he might then guess that moving a document to a
printer would cause it to be printed, or moving it onto a mailbox icon would
result in its being sent to another user.
<P>
Of course, if all you could do with OS/2 Version 2.0 were the same things
you could do without it, there would be no need to have a computer at all.
The point is, of course, that though the objects with which the OS/2 user
works do familiar things in familiar ways, they also have capabilities far
beyond their real-life counterparts.  Consider, for example:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A folder that will, on request, automatically give
you all the monthly cashflow summaries, from its contents of 1000 miscellaneous
papers<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A pad of order forms that never runs out<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A desk on which you can leave all your papers at the
end of the day and be sure that they are still as you left them when you
come in the<!-- entering slot 64 --> next day, with no fear of their being
moved by the cleaners, or of confidential documents being removed<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A sheet of paper which automatically corrects the
spelling of everything you write on it.
<P>
(This would be the Workplace Shell equivalent of a word-processor with a
spellcheck function - the difference is that the user need not know of the
existence of any word-processing package;  to him, the spell-checking capability
is a characteristic of the document itself. This is the essential difference
between object-oriented and application-oriented interfaces.)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
OS/2's Workplace Shell can do all this and, moreover, do it in a way that
the inexperienced user will find a straightforward and natural extension
to the real-life behavior of the objects concerned. Furthermore, the Workplace
Shell allows application developers to extend the range of objects available
to the user to include many more sophisticated or specialized types than
those provided as standard with OS/2.
