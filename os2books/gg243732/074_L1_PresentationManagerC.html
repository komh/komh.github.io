<P>
The OS/2 Presentation Manager user interface was introduced in OS/2 Version
1.1, replacing the textual interface provided by OS/2 Version 1.0. Presentation
Manager provides a graphical, windowed presentation environment that lets
a user execute and view multiple applications on the screen at the same
time. The user can interact with those applications using an event-driven,
object-action user interface which conforms to the guidelines laid down
in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User
Interface Design</I>.
<P>
The Systems Application Architecture CUA component has two major objectives:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->To provide a<I> consistent</I> interface to applications,
in order that users may more easily interact with a variety of applications
and operating system environments without the need to learn and remember
a different set of interface rules and guidelines for each application or
system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->To implement the aforementioned consistency objective
in such a way that the interface to applications is highly<I> intuitive</I>,
in order to minimize the amount of formal application training required
by affording an easy to use interface which encourages users to learn by
exploration.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Both of these objectives can be fulfilled by the Presentation Manager components.
This chapter will outline some of the major features of the Presentation
Manager user interface, for those readers who may be unfamiliar with it.

<P>
The Workplace Shell is not a complete implementation of the CUA 91 <A HREF="299_L2_WorkplaceEnvironment.html"><B>Workplace
Environment</B></A>.  Differences are discussed in <A HREF="222_L1_CUAConformanceintheW.html">CUA
Conformance in the Workplace Shell</A>. /In this chapter, we use standard
Presentation Manager terminology. This is consistent with the terminology
used in the accompanying<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
It is also more correct than using CUA terminology with objects which are
not CUA-compliant.
