<P>
Since users can open as many programs as they like, this is a potential
cause of performance problems. In addition, since the WPS will restart any
programs which were left running at "shutdown", we can conceive of a situation
where performance would slowly degenerate over some time, with the operating
system starting more and more programs each day, even if the user didn't
need them all.
<P>
There are two techniques which can help prevent these problems. The first
one is to use work areas instead of folders, then encourage users to close
a folder when they have finished with it instead of minimizing it. When
a work area is closed, all the programs in it are also closed, so this helps
free resources for the next program(s) the user has to run.
<P>
The second technique is described in <A HREF="170_L3_PreventProgramsResta.html">Prevent
Programs Restarting at IPL</A>, where any previously running programs are
prevented from restarting when the system is restarted. A REXX program is
described which performs this.
<P>
In addition, some WPS functions are inherently slower than others. For example,
opening a folder with a tree view is slower than opening it with an icon
view. Users quickly learn to use the WPS functions in the most appropriate
way.
