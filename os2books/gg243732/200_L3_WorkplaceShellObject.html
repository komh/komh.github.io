<H1>Workplace Shell Object Types</H1><!-- entering slot 220 -->
<P>
There are three main classes in the WPS class hierarchy, descended from
<I>WPObject</I>.  The WPS classes are shown in <A HREF="045_L2_WorkplaceShellClassH.html">Figure
"Workplace Shell Class Hierarchy"</A>
<P>
Classes are used to create the<B> instances</B>, or objects, that the user
sees on the desktop. Each can be<B> subclassed</B> to create a new, derived
class which inherits some of the properties and behaviors of the parent.
Two useful terms to note here are<B> base class</B>, a class which is a
direct subclass of<I> WPObject</I>, and<B> persistence</B>, which denotes
that an object knows how to save its current state.
<P>
The main WPS classes are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>WPObject</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> The<B> superclass</B> from which
all base classes are derived.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> WPAbstract</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL> A
base class that provides persistence via the OS2.INI file. These include
programs, shadow copies and system objects such as the clock. They can be
copied around the Workplace Shell but not to diskette.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> WPFileSystem
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>A base class that provides persistence via the
.CLASSINFO extended attribute of the associated file or directory. Objects
of this class are always stored on disk. They are typically folders and
files and can be copied to any media.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> WPTransient
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 19 -->
<UL>A base class that has no persistence. Examples
of<I> WPTransient</I> objects are the window list and the printer drivers.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
