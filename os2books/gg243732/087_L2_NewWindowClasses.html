A number of new control window classes have been added to Presentation Manager
under OS/2 Version 2.0.  These controls aid in the implementation of the
Workplace Shell and provide enhanced function and flexibility for user dialogs
in Presentation Manager  applications.

end user. More information on using these controls in applications can be
found in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>. and
