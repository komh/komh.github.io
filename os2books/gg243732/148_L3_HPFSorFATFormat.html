<H1>HPFS or FAT Format?</H1><!-- entering slot 157 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell introduces several new reasons for choosing the High
Performance File System (HPFS) instead of the File Allocation Table (FAT)
format for your most heavily used disks and partitions. The main ones are:

<P>
<B>Performance</B>
<P>
Although the FAT file system is much faster in OS/2 V2.0 than it was in
OS/2 Version 1.3, there are still areas where HPFS is faster. One major
advantage is the reduction of disk fragmentation, discussed below. Another
is the performance when reading large files; the "EA_DATA. SF" file on a
FAT file system can exceed 600 KB, which could impair the performance of
instantiating WPFileSystem objects.
<P>
<B>Fragmentation</B>
<P>
Since the WPS encourages users to move files around and create new folders
(directories), the file system is more heavily used than it would be under
DOS. Past experiences with heavily used DOS workstations and LAN Servers
leads us to feel there is a distinct possibility that fragmentation will
cause performance problems on FAT-based disks.
<P>
<B>Use of Extended Attributes</B>
<P>
Since Extended Attributes (EAs) are used extensively by all directories
and files within the desktop structure, there are important considerations
for file transfer between the different file systems. These EAs store settings
information, such as file type, without which the system cannot function
properly. In general, we recommend installing a common file system on all
machines to prevent potential problems with lost EAs. EAs are discussed
more fully in <A HREF="152_L3_ExtendedAttributes.html">Extended Attributes
</A>and <A HREF="214_L2_ExtendedAttributes.html">Extended Attributes</A>.

<P>
<B>Long Filenames</B>
<P>
The WPS allows a user to rename a file by editing the icon description.
On HPFS, this name will be stored as it is typed, including spaces. On FAT,
however, the name is truncated by removing vowels. Not only might this cause
problems with duplicate filenames, it also introduces an inconsistency between
what the user sees in a folder and in drives which would not otherwise occur
with HPFS.
<P>
<B>Support for Multiple Operating Systems</B>
<P>
Multiple operating systems may be required by some users. This would lead
to the user installing different file systems on the various partitions
to support the different operating systems. For example, a user might need
to be able to boot from DOS occasionally, to run programs that don't work
in a VDM. To do this he could format the C: partition as HPFS, for OS/2
V2.0, and the D: partition as FAT, for DOS.
