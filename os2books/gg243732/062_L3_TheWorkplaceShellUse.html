<H1>The Workplace Shell User with Older Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 65 -->
<P>
In reality, relatively few users will be able to work in this way all the
time.  The chances are they will want to use some applications that were
written for OS/2 1.3, or for DOS or Windows.  These generally work in ways
that are not consistent with the purely object-oriented interface described
above.
<P>
For these users the Workplace Shell provides a very flexible desktop environment
from which to launch their non-object-oriented applications. For example,
the<I> Program Reference</I> allows the user to represent any program as
a Workplace Shell object.  This lets it be placed on the desktop or in any
convenient folder and started when required. Furthermore, the Workplace
Shell provides the ability to associate any program with particular types
of data files, so that the user need only open the data file for the associated
program to be automatically invoked. This provides an object-oriented technique
for starting some programs that were not written with this in mind.
