<H1>User Requirements</H1><!-- entering slot 188 -->
<P>
This section describes the process of defining the OS/2 Version 2.0 requirements
for a typical, inexperienced user, selecting the components and setting
up the system. In this case, our user will be running on a stand-alone system.
LAN considerations are discussed in <A HREF="164_L2_UsingtheWorkplaceShe.html">Using
the Workplace Shell in a LAN Environment</A>.
<P>
For instance, a user has a range of tasks to complete as part of his normal
job. These include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Preparing quotations<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Entering orders<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Creating invoices<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Book-keeping<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->General correspondence.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
We will examine the task of creating customer quotations in some detail
to illustrate how we would set up the system for any task.
<P>
Creating quotations involves:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Calculating a price for the goods or services
requested<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Filling these into a quotations document<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Creating a cover letter<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Printing the documents<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Filing the documents.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each task is represented by a work area. The reason we use a work area is
that when it is closed it closes all the programs which have been opened
from within it. Since memory and disk space may be restricted on our system,
leaving programs open could cause us performance problems. Closing them
when we finish one task and switch to another should help prevent that problem.

<P>
Each task involves other subtasks.  For example, calculating the price might
involve looking back at the outcome of previous quotations or checking to
see whether the customer was traditionally a late payer (in which case a
penalty charge might be levied within the price quoted).
<P>
When we look at the information required we see that we need the same information
in several of the subtasks. The customer name and address would be needed
in both the quotation document (which includes the terms and conditions
which apply to the quotation) and the covering letter.
<P>
From the activities above, we can see that we need the following programs:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A spreadsheet to calculate prices<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A word processor to produce and print the documents
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A database to store names and addresses<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->A folder to store the completed files in.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
We decided to use the following programs to illustrate a possible mix of
operating systems and show what degree of interaction is possible under
OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->LOTUS** 1-2-3** /G for OS/2<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->WordPerfect** for Windows**<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->dBase IV** for DOS.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
