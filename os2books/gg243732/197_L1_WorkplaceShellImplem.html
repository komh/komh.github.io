This chapter will help you to understand how the Workplace Shell is implemented,
know what kinds of objects it stores and where it stores information about
them. If you wish to understand the System Object Model, object-oriented
programming in OS/2 V2.0 and how to create your own WPS program you should
read the appropriate sections of the companion volume,<I> OS/2 Version 2.0
- Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
