<H1>Container</H1><!-- entering slot 94 -->
<P>
Folders are extensively used within the Workplace Shell to logically group
objects (represented by their icons) on the desktop. A folder consists of
a standard window frame plus a container control which occupies the whole
of the client area. A folder can contain other folders, objects representing
work items such as reports, or physical items such as printers. The objects
displayed by a container control are determined by the application.
<P>
<A HREF="011_L2_ContainerControlUsed.html">Figure "Container Control Used
in Folder Window"</A>
<P>
Various types of objects may be displayed within a container; these include
objects representing printers and other physical devices, as well as those
representing items such as files or documents. Information about these objects
can be presented in a variety of views.  Each view describes the objects
in a different format, some giving different and/or additional information.
The container supports the following views of its data:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Icon view</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> This view displays either icons
or bitmaps, with accompanying text beneath them, to represent the items
in the container. This is the default view for a container.
<P>
The user may group the objects as he chooses. He can overlap them, in a
"messy desktop" fashion, or can have them automatically positioned. The
default icon view is not "gridded"; that is, it has free-form characteristics
so data can be placed in various relative positions and still have meaning.
However, if a gridded display format is preferred, the objects can also
be arranged in rows from left to right and from top to bottom.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> The
name view</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> This displays either icons or bitmaps
with accompanying text to the right of each icon or bitmap, representing
the items in the container. Items are arranged in a single column. A variant
of the name view is the<B> flowed name view</B>, where items are arranged
in multiple columns.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Text view</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> This
view is similar to the Presentation Manager list box in OS/2. Text strings
are displayed in columns. This view also offers the option of flowing the
text into multiple columns to fit the windows when it is sized.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Details
view</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> This view allows the user to display detailed
information about items in an unlimited number of scrollable columns. The
data within each column may be icons, bitmaps, text strings, or national
language support (NLS) formatted date or time strings. An optional splitbar
may be used to divide the display area into two windows which scroll independently
horizontally and dependently vertically.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Tree
view</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> This presents data in a hierarchical format,
similar to the directory layout used in the OS/2 Version 1.3 File Manager.
The leftmost items displayed in the tree view are at the root level. Root
level items can contain other items called children. These can be displayed
in the tree view. If the children are not displayed, the parent item can
be expanded to display them as a new branch in the tree view.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Each instance of text in the container can consist of unlimited lines with
unlimited characters in each line. In addition, the container control does
not limit the number of objects within a container. Objects are automatically
arranged within the client area of the container.
<P>
Direct manipulation is supported in all views of the container control.
This allows the user to drag container items within a current window or
from one window to another.
<P>
Containers and their use by<!-- entering slot 95 --> applications are further
explored in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.

<P>
<B>User Interaction</B>
<P>
The end user can alter any text field in the container, including the container
title, column headings in details view and all container items, through
direct editing. Text strings can also be individually set to a "read-only"
state.
<P>
Objects within a container may be selected through marquee, touch swipe,
range swipe, and first letter selection techniques. The container control
supports single, extended, and multiple selection types; these are described
in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Interface Design
Reference</I>.
