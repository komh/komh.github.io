<H1>Arranging Folders and Objects According to Tasks</H1><!-- entering slot 113 -->
<P>
The user is free to create folders for all kinds of purposes.  The major
reason for folders is the organization of tasks.  One folder may have all
the objects in it which are needed for word processing, another one may
be related to bookkeeping, and so on.  The user opens only the folder that
is needed at the time  and therefore the desktop can be kept tidy.
<P>
The user can "personalize" the folder for each task. For example, he can
change the icon to help him find the folder more quickly. He can also make
the folder into a work area; this tells the WPS to close any objects within
the folder when the folder is closed and reopen them automatically when
the folder is next opened.
