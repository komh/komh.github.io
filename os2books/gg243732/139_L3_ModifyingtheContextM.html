<P>
The experienced user may be able to add items to the context menus of selected
objects.  The procedure is basically the same for any kind of object.  It
is described here using the desktop menu. <A HREF="032_L2_ExpandedDesktopMenu.html">Figure
"Expanded Desktop Menu"</A> shows how the menu looks after the modification:

<P>
All the modifications are made through the<I> Settings</I> view of the object.
 For the desktop, this is accessed by clicking mouse button 2 on the desktop
background.
<P>
The following sequence will add "OS/2 Window" to the context menu of the
desktop. When this choice is selected, an OS/2 Window Session will be started.
