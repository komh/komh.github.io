<H1>Frame Area</H1><!-- entering slot 80 -->
<P>
The frame area contains a number of other windows, such as the system menu,
title bar and menu bar, which allow the user to perform window manipulation
functions.  These control windows partly conform to the definitions laid
down in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to
User Interface Design</I>. They are illustrated in <A HREF="007_L2_PresentationManagerW.html">Figure
"Presentation Manager Window"</A> and explained below:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Sizing Border</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> A standard window has a sizing
border, which allows the window to be<B> sized</B> (that is, made smaller
or larger) using the mouse or a function-key sequence.  When the mouse pointer
is moved over the sizing border, the pointer changes from the standard (arrow)
pointer to a special sizing pointer.  The user clicks and holds one of the
mouse button while moving the mouse, and the window is sized accordingly.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Title Bar</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> A standard
window has a title bar, which performs two functions.  Firstly, it identifies
an application or window to the user. Secondly, it acts as a "handle" whereby
the window may be repositioned on the screen.  The user moves the mouse
pointer over the title bar, clicks and holds mouse button 2 while moving
the mouse, and the window moves accordingly.
<P>
The 1991 SAA CUA guidelines  stipulate that the title bar for a window should
contain both the system menu icon and a title bar icon for that window.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Menu Bar</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The main
window of an application also has a menu bar, which acts as a primary menu
for the application.  Entries in the menu bar are selected by pointing with
the mouse pointer and clicking a mouse button.  Each menu bar entry is associated
with a<B> pull-down menu</B>; (a list of actions associated with the entry),
which appears when the bar entry is selected.  The pull-down menu provides
submenus for the menu bar.  Multiple levels of pull-down menus may be used
in an application, although the number of levels is normally minimized for
the sake of simplicity.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Minimize Icon</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> In
the top-right corner of a standard window, two icons are displayed; the
left one is the minimize icon.  When it is selected, the window itself is
reduced to an icon.  The icon may be generated by the application controlling
the window, or may be a default icon supplied by the Presentation Manager.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Maximize Icon</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> The
maximize icon is displayed in the top-right corner of a standard window
along with the minimize icon.  When selected, the maximize icon causes the
window to be resized to the maximum defined by the program.  Other windows
on the screen may be made invisible (although they are still present, logically
"behind" the maximized window). If a maximized window is explicitly resized
using the sizing border, other windows may become visible again.  A maximized
window may be restored to its former size and position on the screen by
using the<B> restore icon</B> (see below).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Restore
Icon</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> In a maximized window<I> only</I>, the
restore icon replaces the maximize icon.  When selected, this icon causes
the window to return to the size and position it occupied before it was
maximized.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Small Icon</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> In
the top-left corner of a standard window, a small icon is displayed. This
is a minimized version of the object icon. When selected using the mouse
pointer, it displays a system menu with move, size, minimize, maximize and
restore options. This menu provides an alternative to the use of the frame
area border, title bar and icons for these operations.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Scroll
Bars</B><!-- lm: 0x12 15 -->
<UL> If the information in the client area
is too big to fit into the size of the window on the screen, scroll bars
should be created to allow the user to scroll through the information. A
scroll bar can be either vertical or horizontal. It consists of a slider
with arrow icons at each end of the bar. Clicking the mouse on an arrow
scrolls one line in the indicated direction, while clicking on the bar between
the arrow and the slider scrolls one<!-- entering slot 81 --> page in the
indicated direction.  Clicking and holding down  MB1 while dragging the
slider up or down the scroll bar results in continuous scrolling.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Note that these facilities are common to most, if not all Presentation Manager
applications, and their processing is handled by Presentation Manager rather
than by the application.  Thus the user is provided with a consistent interface
for interacting with and manipulating windowed applications on the screen,
which mostly conforms to the guidelines laid down in the<I> IBM Systems
Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User Interface Design</I>.
