<P>
An application must store, in shared memory, text data that is destined
for the clipboard. The application passes the clipboard a pointer, which
the clipboard uses to access the shared memory object. To pass a bit map
or metafile to the clipboard, an application passes the clipboard a bit
map or metafile handle. The clipboard functions make the bit map or metafile
<I>shareable</I>.
