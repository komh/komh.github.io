<H1>New Controls and Dialogs</H1><!-- entering slot 73 -->
<P>
A number of new control window classes are provided under OS/2 Version 2.0.
 These are primarily used to aid in the implementation of the Workplace
Shell  and the 1991 SAA CUA Workplace Environment, and are available for
use by application developers.  They are:
<P>
<B>Container</B>
<P>
The purpose of the container control is to hold other objects within the
Workplace Shell, in order to allow grouping of objects on the desktop in
a logical manner determined by the end user. A container control may display
objects in various formats or views, where each view displays different
information about the objects.
<P>
<B>Notebook</B>
<P>
The notebook control provides a method for organization and navigation of
user dialogs, where the required information and prompts may not be easily
displayed in a single dialog box.  A notebook control looks like a multi-page
notebook, with a dialog on each page.  The user can interact with the top
page, and can move to the others either page-by-page or directly, by using
tabs attached to the edges of the pages.
<P>
<B>Slider</B>
<P>
The slider control looks rather like the slider controls found on some audio
equipment, and is used where a value must be chosen from a continuous but
finite range of settings. It is ideal for setting approximate values and
properties, particularly analog values which are not easily enumerated or
expressed in other ways. The slider indicates a particular quantity and
the range of allowable values for that quantity.
<P>
<B>Value Set</B>
<P>
The value set control is similar in function to the radio button control
implemented in previous versions of OS/2, but provides additional flexibility
in that it may be used to display a set of values in graphical, numeric,
or textual format, whereas the radio button is limited to textual format
only.  As with a radio button, selecting one item in the set deselects any
previously selected value.
<P>
<B>Progress Indicator</B>
<P>
The progress indicator control is used to display the progress of a long-running
operation, such as file transfer or disk backup/restore, by means of a hollow
bar that fills with color from one end like a thermometer.
