<H1>Changing the Icon for an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 149 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell makes it easy to customize the appearance of the objects
the user needs to use. The icon description can be changed by selecting
it with "Alt-mouse button 1" or the icon and its text can both be changed
from its<I> Settings</I> view.
<P>
The "General" page of the objects<I> Settings</I> view gives you two ways
to change the icon:<I> Find</I> and<I> Edit</I>. Find lets the user choose
a new icon from those already created. Edit starts the icon editor to let
you work with the icon; this can be used to modify the existing icon or
to work with a different one.
<P>
Please note that you must take care to edit the icon belonging to your particular
"device"; that is, 32x32 and 16x16 icons for VGA/EGA, 40x40 and 20x20 for
higher resolutions. The "Device" pull-down in the menu bar of the icon editor
will let you do this.
<P>
The Icon Editor is very flexible.  A user can:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Paste in a new icon from the clipboard, providing
it was placed on the clipboard before the Edit action was started<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Use the icon editor menu bar to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Select "Open..." to choose a new icon<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<BR>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->Select "Save as..." to save it under the<I> original
</I>filename for the old icon that was first loaded into the icon editor
(this is usually x:\OS2\WP!<I>n</I>.ICO, where<I> n</I> is a number).<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
When you have finished, close the window and respond "yes" to the prompt
to save the changes.
