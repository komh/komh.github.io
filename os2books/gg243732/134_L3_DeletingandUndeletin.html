<H1>Deleting and Undeleting an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 142 -->
<P>
Almost any object can be deleted by either dropping it on the shredder or
by selecting<I> Delete...</I>  from the object's context menu. As in previous
versions of OS/2, files and directories can be deleted from a command line.

<P>
To help the user recover from accidentally deleting files from a command
prompt, OS/2 can set up a special<I> Delete</I> directory on each logical
drive. Each deleted file will be put into this directory until a user-specified
size is reached.  Only then will the files really be deleted from the disk.
 This will be done in a FIFO (First In, First Out) sequence.
<P>
Files can be recovered easily if they are still in the DELETE directory
by just copying them back to where they were.  If a file is already erased
from the DELETE directory it may still be recoverable with the UNDELETE
command.
