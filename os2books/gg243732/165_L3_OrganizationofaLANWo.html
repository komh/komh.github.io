<H1>Organization of a LAN Workplace</H1><!-- entering slot 175 -->
<P>
The distribution of task-oriented resources between server and workstation
is largely a matter of security, licensing, performance and the hardware
capabilities. The planning and set up of a user environment should also
consider issues such as LAN availability.
<P>
In a stable environment with file mirroring almost all data and programs
could be stored on, and accessed from, a LAN server. The integration of
the Workplace Shell and LAN permits the following combinations:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Common programs and data can be stored on the LAN
server<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Programs and data limited to certain users can be
placed in dedicated folders on the LAN server<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Highly important programs, which must be available
to a user even if the LAN is not running, may reside on the workstation
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Shadow copies of LAN data files can be set up in local
folders within the desktop structure.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
As a network is hierarchically organized it may seem to make sense to focus
on the LAN servers for the placement of folders and data objects. However,
using the<I> Network</I> and<I> LAN Server</I> folders as the standard way
of providing access to programs and data would be inconsistent with the
way the user accesses local resources.
<P>
This would mean that he would have to work his way through the hierarchy
each time he needed access to LAN-resident resources. For this reason, a
better approach would be to use shadow copies of the resources he wants
to use from the network directories.
<P>
Several different approaches to arranging local and remote folders are possible.
 The possible combinations of folders and files are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Shadow folder with shadow files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Shadow folder with local files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Shadow folder with local and shadow files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Local folder with local files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Local folder with shadow files<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Local folder with local and shadow files.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
In all cases, we assume that programs are stored remotely on the LAN server
and that only files are displayed in folders, not programs.
<P>
<B>Shadow Folders</B>
<P>
The shadow folder is a pointer to the real folder (and associated directory)
on the LAN Server. Any objects in the LAN folder will also be shadow copied
into the shadow LAN folder. This approach allows the directory to be maintained
by an administrator so the user can concentrate on the tasks he is paid
to perform. It ensures that sensitive data can be secured and backed up
at a central point.
<P>
The shadow LAN folder has some unique behaviors. It will not open if all
the real objects reside on the LAN and the user has not logged on to the
server. This is because the logical drive on the LAN cannot be accessed
by the folder; this can be seen in the<I> File</I> page of the folder<I> Settings
</I>view.
<P>
However, this situation is modified where local objects have been placed
in the shadow LAN folder. In this case the folder can be opened but if the
user then tries to access a shadow object before "login", the Workplace
Shell issues a warning.
<P>
The following sequence is used to set up a shadow LAN folder:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a shadow copy for the user's "home" folder
from the LAN<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Put any local, real objects in the shadow LAN
folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create shadow copies of the local data file objects
in the shadow LAN folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create new program references for local programs
in the shadow LAN folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create new program references for remote programs
in the shadow LAN folder.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Program files should not be "shadowed" to the local folder. Instead, a new
program reference for the program should be created within that folder.
 See <A HREF="158_L3_ShadowCopiesofProgra.html">Shadow Copies of Programs
</A>for more information.
<P>
There are some differences in the usage of a shadow LAN folder and a local
folder which may seem confusing to the inexperienced user. For example,
if the user has a shadow copy of a LAN folder and then tries to make a shadow
copy of a file from the LAN folder into that shadow folder, the WPS will,
correctly, not allow it.
<P>
Another example would be where the user wants to "logout" but<!-- entering slot 176 --> one
of the objects in the shadow folder or the<I> LAN Server</I> folder is still
in use. In this event, the Workplace Shell will report an<I> active connection
</I>and refuse to close.
<P>
There are also disadvantages to using shadow copies of either a local or
a LAN folder. For instance, the act of renaming a shadow folder by "direct
editing" the icon description will result in the physical name being changed.
This can cause problems on a shared directory where many users have Read/Write
(RW) access. Under such circumstances it would be better to set up local
folders with shadow copies of files, as described below.
<P>
<B>Local Folder</B>
<P>
Instead of a shadow copy of the LAN folder, a better approach is to use
a local folder (or work area). All types of objects, both real (local) and
shadow (local and remote), can be stored in a local folder. The advantage
of this approach is added security against loss of data and more consistency
in organizing the WPS by task.
<P>
The set up is completely transparent to the user and the behavior of shadow
copies of LAN data files does not differ from Shadow Folders above.
<P>
The local folder resides in the local desktop structure. It therefore has
a real name and the disk space needed depends on the number and type of
objects stored in it.
<P>
To set up a local folder with LAN objects requires the following steps:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create a local folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create shadow copies of the LAN data file objects
in the local folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create shadow copies of local data file objects
in the local folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create new program references for local programs
in the local folder<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Create new program references for remote programs
in the local folder.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Program files should not be "shadowed" to the local folder. Instead, a new
program reference for the program should be created within that folder.
