<H1>The Workplace Shell as an OS/2 Program</H1><!-- entering slot 218 -->
<P>
One of the biggest changes in OS/2 V2.0 is its support for installable interface
shells. The installable feature concept was introduced in OS/2 Version 1.3
with the HPFS file system; OS/2 V2.0 has now extended it to the user interface.
The installable feature approach gives users the flexibility to set up their
system to meet their precise needs.
<P>
The Workplace Shell is called from the CONFIG.SYS file as follows:
<PRE>  PROTSHELL=C:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE
</PRE>

<P>
Alternative shells can be implemented or, if desired, a single program,
such as Lotus 1-2-3 /G, could be started directly without having to start
the WPS at all.
<P>
The Workplace Shell run in its own process, starting threads as needed.
 For instance, the contents of a directory can be read while its associated
folder window is being created. In addition, the WPS starts a second process
to monitor the shell and restart it if it fails.
<P>
This in turn means that the overall system is no longer as vulnerable to
shell errors as was the case in all previous versions of OS/2. If it detects
an error, the WPS is capable of restarting itself without having to shut
down and restart all the other running programs.
<P>
The WPS does this by saving all the window information in real time and
restoring it when the shell process is restarted.
<P>
Existing PM applications are unaffected. PM programs which are implemented
with a Model/View structure, where the "view" part runs in the WPS process,
will have to be restarted and reconnected to the "model" portion of the
program running in its own process.
<P>
The Workplace Shell also notes which programs are running at any time and
can restart them when the operating system is re-IPLed.
