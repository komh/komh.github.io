<H1>Setting up the Users Work Area</H1><!-- entering slot 190 -->
<P>
We created the<I> Quotations</I> work area by dragging a new folder from
the folder template onto the desktop. We then renamed it, opened the settings
view and checked the work area checkbox in the file page.
<P>
<A HREF="042_L2_WorkplaceShellQuotat.html">Figure "Workplace Shell Quotations
Work Area"</A>
<P>
Within the work area we have the following templates:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Quote.doc<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Letter.doc<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Prices.wg2.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Quote.doc and Letter.doc are WordPerfect documents, Prices.wg2 is a Lotus
spreadsheet. They are all created in the following way:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Start the program, from the command prompt or
by double clicking on its icon<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Lay out the document or spreadsheet the way you
want it<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Save the file<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Copy the file to the Quotations directory using
<I>Drives</I><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open the files<I> Settings</I> view and check
the template checkbox on the "File" page<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Close the<I> Settings</I> view.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The data file can be linked to the program in any of the ways described
in <A HREF="155_L3_SettingUpProgramsint.html">Setting Up Programs in the
Workplace Shell</A>. Since the DOS programs do not support the concept of
file types, an association based on file extension was set up in each program.

<P>
The<I> Quotations</I> folder was created in the same way as the work area,
that is, a new one was created by dragging it from the folder template and
dropping it into the<I> Quotations</I> work area.
<P>
The user can now tear off a new "Prices" spreadsheet, rename it using some
combination of the customer name and date, open it to fill in the necessary
details, print it, then file it by dropping it in the<I> Quotations</I> folder.

<P>
When the user needs to switch to another task, such as creating invoices,
he closes the<I> Quotations</I> folder. This stops any running programs,
freeing the system memory and SWAPPER.DAT file. He then starts the next
task by opening its folder.
