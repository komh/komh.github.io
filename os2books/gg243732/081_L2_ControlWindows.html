<H1>Control Windows</H1><!-- entering slot 86 -->
<P>
The window areas and dialog boxes contain a number of<B> control windows
</B>to display and receive information.  These control windows are in fact
specialized classes of window defined by Presentation Manager.  The various
types of control window are briefly explained below; complete definitions
of the appearance and behavior of each type of control window are given
in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User
Interface Design</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Static Text</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This is constant text, displayed
in the dialog box for information purposes only; such text does not change
from one invocation of the dialog to the next.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Entry
Field</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This is an area, of a defined size, where
a user may enter alphanumeric or numeric data.  An application may also
place a default entry in an entry field to simplify the user's task of entering
information; the user may then edit the existing data or replace it with
new data.
<P>
Entry fields may be single-line or multi-line.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> List
Box</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This is an area which contains a list of
items, one or more of which may be selected by the user.  If a list contains
more information than will fit into the designated area, a list box may
contain vertical and/or horizontal scroll bars.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Combo
Box</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> The combo box or<B> prompted entry field
</B>is a combination of the entry field and list box types;  by default,
an entry field is displayed into which the user may enter text.  At the
right-hand side of the entry field however, is an icon which when selected,
causes a<I> drop-down</I> list box to appear below the entry field, containing
a list of valid entries.  The user may enter a value directly into the entry
field or, if unsure, may use the list box to select a valid entry.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Check
Box</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This is a square area, surrounded by a
border with accompanying text, which denotes an option that may be toggled
on and off by the user.  For instance, in a text search the option to ignore
case may be implemented as a check box.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Radio
Button</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> Radio buttons are small round areas
which are usually displayed in groups; a group of radio buttons denotes
a series of mutually exclusive options from which the user may select one
option only. Making a selection immediately deselects any previous choice.
 The selected option in a group of radio buttons is indicated by a dark
center in the button.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Push Button</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This
is a square or rectangular area containing some brief text and surrounded
by a border. It denotes an option which may be selected for immediate action.
 Selections such as "Enter" and "Cancel" to complete or cancel a dialog
are normally implemented in this way.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Spin Button
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL>The spin button is used to display a currently
selected option from a finite range of options.  The items displayed in
the spin button control are textual, and may represent any alphanumeric
item.  It consists of a single-line entry field, and up and down arrows
that are stacked on top of one another.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Slider
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL>This is a scale with an index which may be
moved along the scale using the mouse or keyboard.  The slider allows the
selection of a value from a contiguous set of values.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Value
Set</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> This is similar in concept to a group of
radio buttons, except that items within the group may be icons,<!-- entering slot 87 --> bitmaps
or color patches as well as text strings. The value set control window allows
the selection of a non-textual item from a set of mutually exclusive options.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Container</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL> A container
acts as a repository and provides a mechanism to organize the desktop to
suit the requirements of the user.  Its basic function is to hold objects
such as files, applications and devices represented by icons.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Notebook
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 14 -->
<UL>A notebook is a visual component that organizes
information on individual pages so that a user can find and display that
information quickly and easily. This component simulates a real notebook
but improves on it by overcoming the real notebooks natural limitations.

<P>
These control windows are defined as child windows with the main window
as their parent.
<P>
Note also that control windows are not restricted to use in the main window
client area, and may also be created within dialog boxes. Control windows
are clipped to the boundaries of their parent window according to the same
rules as other child windows.
