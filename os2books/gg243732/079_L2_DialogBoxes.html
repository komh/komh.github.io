<H1>Dialog Boxes</H1><!-- entering slot 84 -->
<P>
A<B> dialog box</B> is a special type of window for use in certain circumstances
where an additional interaction with the user is required.  Dialog boxes
may be of two distinct types;<B> modal</B> or<B> modeless</B>.
<P>
A dialog box is created as a short-lived window to receive and/or display
a particular set of information required for the correct performance of
an action by the application.
<P>
With a modal dialog box, the user may not interact with another window until
the dialog is complete. This modality may be within an application (preventing
interaction with other windows controlled by this application program, while
allowing interaction with other applications in the system) or system-wide
(preventing interaction with any other window until the dialog is complete).

<P>
With a modeless dialog box, the user may continue to work with the primary
application window, for example using the "Find" window with the<I> OS/2
System Editor</I>. Modeless dialogs are preferred by CUA.
<P>
One difference between a dialog box and a standard window is that the dialog
box may not be sized on the screen, nor may it be maximized or minimized
except in certain circumstances.  This property of a dialog box is crucial
in maintaining the integrity of the dialog with the end user. Note that
although a dialog box is not sizable, it may be moved on the desktop.
<P>
An example of a dialog box is shown in <A HREF="008_L2_PresentationManagerD.html">Figure
"Presentation Manager Dialog Box"</A>.
<P>
For example, if a user selects "Open" from the "File" pull-down menu, the
application requires the name of the file before it can be opened; this
information will be requested using a modal dialog box.  For confirmation
with the user, a<B> message box</B> may be used as an alternative to a dialog
box; see <A HREF="080_L2_MessageBoxes.html">Message Boxes</A> for further
information.
