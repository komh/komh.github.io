<B>Background</B>
<P>
The background is the total space on the desktop. It is a special form of
a container but follows all basic rules for a folder.  It has a context
menu which is activated using mouse button 2.  Not all of the background
may be visible.
<P>
<B>Size</B>
<P>
The desktop allows you to organize (or disorganize) documents and files
the way you would on a real desktop. It cannot be smaller than the physical
screen. This desktop concept helps the user to organize things and thereby
focus on specific groups of objects.
<P>
<B>Enlarging the Desktop</B>
<P>
The size of the desktop starts out as large as the screen.  When more objects
are put on the desktop than the basic size can hold the desktop will be
extended automatically.  Scroll bars are added to the desktop if objects
are put beyond the edges of the screen.
<P>
<B>Changing the Background</B>
<P>
The Workplace Shell allows the user to specify a color or a bitmap to use
for the desktop background.  Individual colors or bitmaps may also be chosen
for any folder in the system.
<P>
The desktop background is specified from the<I> Background</I> page of the
desktop<I> Settings</I> view.  The user may specify one of the following:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->An<B> image</B> uses a single bitmap to cover the
entire desktop.  The user has the option to display:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A<B> normal</B> image, where the bitmap is displayed
at its normal size, centered on the desktop or folder<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A<B> tiled</B> image, where the bitmap is repeated
many times to cover the entire desktop or folder<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->A<B> scaled</B> image, where the bitmap is stretched
to cover the entire desktop or folder.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>A
<B>color</B> simply sets the entire desktop background to the required color.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
A bitmap may be designed using various graphics packages, or may be standard
bitmap-format files obtained from other sources.  A number of public bulletin
board services contain repositories of such bitmaps.
