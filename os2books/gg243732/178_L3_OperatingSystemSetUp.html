<H1>Operating System Set Up</H1><!-- entering slot 189 -->
<P>
Our objective was to provide a working system on an IBM PS/2* model 55-060
with 8 MB of memory. For performance and cost-effectiveness, we replaced
the standard planar memory with 4 MB Single In line Memory Modules (SIMMs).
The system is partitioned as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>C:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL> Operating system partition - 23MB available
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>D:</B><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL> Applications partition
- 35MB available.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The partition size for the operating system was chosen on the basis of requiring
approximately 18 MB of disk storage for our operating system, plus 5 MB
to allow us to add new features in the future. This will let us install
new versions of the operating system, which might require reformatting the
partition, without impacting our applications and data.
<P>
The desktop, spooler and swapper files were moved to drive D:.  This was
done as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Swapper</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL> This was changed after the base installation,
before completing the selective install.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Desktop
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL>This was performed after the installation.  We
used the<I> Drives</I> folder to move the entire desktop structure from
the C: drive to the D: drive.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Spooler</B><!-- lm: 0x2 12 -->
<UL> This
was performed after the installation. We opened a "Settings" view of the
<I>Spooler</I> folder and changed the path there.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
