<P>
In many cases a special setup for users is required. This setup can be created
easily by putting shadows of programs to be run (for instance Communications
Manager) into the<I> Startup</I> folder. This folder is opened when the
operating system is initially loaded (known as "initial program load" -
IPL - or "boot") and the applications in it are then started.
<P>
Though a shutdown remembers the running applications and restarts them after
booting the system there is still a need for the<I> Startup</I> folder.
Shutdown only remembers what was running at the time, whereas the<I> Startup
</I>folder has a fixed set of applications to start no matter if they were
running at shutdown or not.

It is also possible to order items in the<I> Startup</I> folder. First,
display the folder using an ordered view (that is, anything except icon
view non-grid). Then drag items into the folder in the required order. This
can be useful for programs which are dependent on others being started before
they are started.
