<H1>Writing PM Applications to Work with the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 207 -->
<P>
The Presentation Manager has been enhanced to include several new classes
for use with the Workplace Shell, notably the<I> Container</I> and<I> Notebook
</I>classes. The OS/2 V2.0 Presentation Manager would seem to have all the
basic requirements for writing programs that have the capabilities of Workplace
Shell applications, without programmers having to learn SOM or become familiar
with the Workplace Shell class hierarchy.
<P>
The question that arises therefore is this: how well can a straightforward
PM program that uses the new classes and the drag/drop protocols integrate
itself into the WPS environment?  This section helps to answer this.
