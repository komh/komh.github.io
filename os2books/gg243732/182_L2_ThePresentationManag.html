<H1>The Presentation Manager Application Model</H1><!-- entering slot 193 -->
<P>
The conceptual model upon which a Presentation Manager application is based
differs somewhat from "conventional" application models.  The components
of a conventional application communicate with one another via function
calls and pass information in the form of parameters.  The components of
a Presentation Manager application are called windows, and communicate using
messages which are transmitted between windows by Presentation Manager on
the application's behalf.
<P>
This section will examine the conceptual application model implemented by
Presentation Manager.  The intent of this section is to provide the reader
with an introduction only.  A more detailed examination of the application
model from a programmer's viewpoint is given in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume
4:  Application Development</I>.
