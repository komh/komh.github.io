<H1>Workplace Shell as an Application Environment</H1><!-- entering slot 70 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell provides a programming environment, in which suitably
written programs can add user-defined object types to those provided with
the system.  Such objects may simply be modified versions of the supplied
object types - such as a new type of folder that requests a password before
the user is allowed to open it - or object types related to specific productivity
applications, such as a<I> spreadsheet</I> object, or even object types
that are specific to a particular user's business, such as<I> Customer</I>,
<I>Order</I> or<I> Motor Insurance Policy</I>.
<P>
It has been found that a natural and productive way to implement this kind
of user interface is to use object-oriented programming techniques.  The
Workplace Shell itself is written in this way, using a new component of
OS/2 V2.0 called the <A HREF="289_L2_SystemObjectModel.html"><B>System Object
Model</B> (SOM)</A>. SOM is a set of tools and APIs that allows object-oriented
programs to be written in a mixture of programming languages, including
languages that are not themselves object-oriented, such as C.  All the Workplace
Shell object types - folders, data files, printers, etc. - are implemented
as SOM objects.
