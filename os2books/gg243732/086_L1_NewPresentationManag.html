<H1>New Presentation Manager Features</H1><!-- entering slot 92 -->
<P>
The component of the operating system which is responsible for interaction
with the end user is known as the user shell. The PM Shell in OS/2 V1.3
has been replaced in OS/2 Version 2.0 by an enhanced, object-oriented user
shell known as the<I> Workplace Shell</I>, which implements the 1991 CUA
Workplace Environment.
<P>
The Workplace Shell allows users to become more task-oriented by simplifying
the user interface and reducing the amount of system-specific knowledge
required to perform work tasks. The high degree of consistency in the operating
system also reduces the amount of user education needed to operate the system.

<P>
The shell has been redesigned for OS/2 Version 2.0 to give the user a single
interface to manage multiple types of objects, including devices (printer
and drives), files, and programs. Each defined printer or attached drive
is a separate icon. These objects are arranged at will on the desktop or
in specific shell windows.  The user interacts with the objects using a
well-defined drag and drop environment and is able to manipulate files without
needing to be concerned about the file directory hierarchy.  However, if
the user wishes, multiple directory trees are accessible simultaneously.
 Views, selection techniques, and actions are consistent throughout the
shell.
<P>
This chapter reviews the changes to Presentation Manager. Some of the information
has been abstracted from articles written by the developers in the<I> IBM
Personal System Developer, Winter 1992</I>.
