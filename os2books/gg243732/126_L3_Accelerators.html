<P>
CUA recommends that applications are written with both mouse and keyboard
use in mind. To facilitate this, menus should be accessible through<B> accelerators.
</B>Accelerators allow the user to access menus by depressing combinations
of keys, usually Alt plus some letter. They also permit selection of a choice
from a menu by a single letter.
<P>
This does not necessarily work in applications that use those key combinations
themselves. If, for instance, a menu provides "File" in a menu, then the
capital F cannot be used within the application for a function like "Find".
In those cases either the key combinations in the application have to be
modified (often possible in a profile) or the mouse or function keys have
to be used.  Please note that uppercase and lowercase characters may be
treated differently.  This is one of the reasons why CUA demands that applications
respect a number of definitions, for example F1=HELP.
