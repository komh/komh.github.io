<H1>Container Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 116 -->
<P>
As the name implies these objects are organizational helpers. As in an office,
a container holds the objects you are dealing with. They can store any WPS
object, including other containers. The standard container in the Workplace
Shell is the folder. A folder icon looks, by default, like a manila (cardboard)
folder. They are often "personalized" by the user or administrator for easier
identification on a cluttered desktop.
<P>
Container objects may be folders or work areas. Both types of containers
appear and behave in a similar manner; the user can copy or move an object
between any container, either folder or work area.
<P>
<B>Folders</B>
<P>
A folder can store and display any kind of Workplace Shell object, but it
has a "passive" nature. Even while objects can be opened or started from
within a folder, it just stores them and doesn't know anything about them.

<P>
<B>Work Areas</B>
<P>
In contrast to folders, a work area is not completely passive. If an object
in a work area has been opened with a different view and the work area is
being closed, all the "dependent" views will be closed too.
