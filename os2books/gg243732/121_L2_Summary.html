<P>
This chapter discussed many characteristics of the Workplace Shell, including
the main WPS objects, the LAN independent shell objects and how they are
combined to provide a comprehensive and consistent user interface.
<P>
There are three main classes of objects within the Workplace Shell: devices,
containers and data objects. Within each class there are many types or "subclasses"
which have specific features to enable them to perform specialized functions.
For example, both folders and work areas are a type of container but work
areas have a unique characteristic of being able to close any programs which
were started from them when the work area is closed.
<P>
LAN integration in OS/2 V2.0 is now much easier, thanks to the LAN independent
shell. Access to LAN resources is seamless, and objects can be accessed
on the LAN, and then acted on, as if they were local objects. Several new
icons, such as the<I> Network</I> folder, are placed on the desktop when
LAN support is installed.
