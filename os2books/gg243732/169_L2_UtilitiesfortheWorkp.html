<P>
This section discusses various techniques that may be applied to the WPS
to tailor it to the needs of specific users or groups of users. In general,
REXX programs are used here to illustrate the points, although for security
and performance these might be rewritten as C programs before widespread
distribution.
<P>
These procedures assume that SysLoadFuncs has already been loaded, as shown
below:
<PRE>   /* Rexx program that uses RexxUtil functions */
   call RxFuncAdd 'SysLoadFuncs', 'RexxUtil', 'SysLoadFuncs'
   call SysLoadFuncs
</PRE>

<P>

</A>for more details.
