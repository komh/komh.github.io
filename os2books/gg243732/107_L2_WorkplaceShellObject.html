<H1>Workplace Shell Objects</H1><!-- entering slot 114 -->
<P>
There are three main classes of objects defined by CUA 91 and implemented
in the Workplace Shell:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Device objects (such as printers and shredders)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Container objects (such as folders and work areas)
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Data objects (such as files).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Each object is represented on the desktop by an icon.
<P>
Objects typically have a default action which is performed on other objects
which are dropped on the object.  For example, a printer is a device from
the user's perspective.  However, it also is a container since it can queue
several files.  A shredder is a device which deletes the objects dropped
on it.  A diskette is a container which stores the objects dropped on it.

<P>
The objects found in the Workplace Shell are discussed in this section.
