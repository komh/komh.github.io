<P>
The new control window classes provided under Presentation Manager in OS/2
Version 2.0 help in the implementation of the Workplace Shell and enable
application developers to create applications which more easily integrate
with the 1991 SAA CUA Workplace Environment.
<P>
Icons and containers are fundamental to the Workplace Shell, and their inclusion
as control window classes provides the means for consistent behavior of
such objects between all applications on the desktop.  The notebook control
allows the display and navigation of complex user dialogs in an organized
manner, within the context of the Workplace Shell.
<P>
The slider, value set, and spin button control window classes provide additional
flexibility for end-user dialogs, enabling applications to present properties
to the user in a more meaningful and less confusing manner than was the
case in previous versions of OS/2.
<P>
The progress indicator control window class allows applications to display
progress information for long-running operations, in a consistent manner.
 The implementation of this capability as a control window eliminates the
need for application developers to explicitly code such function into their
programs.
<P>
Functional enhancements have been made to IPF under OS/2 Version 2.0, resulting
in greater functionality and flexibility in information panels produced
for help files or online documentation.  This enhancements includes support
for multiple viewports, support for multiple fonts and character sizes.
