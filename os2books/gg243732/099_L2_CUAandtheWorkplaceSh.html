<H1>CUA and the Workplace Shell</H1><!-- entering slot 106 -->
<P>
In previous versions of OS/2, the user shell was designed to conform to
the 1989 SAA CUA Graphical Model.  The Workplace Shell of OS/2 Version 2.0
now reflects the 1991 SAA CUA Workplace Environment.
<P>
In May 1989 (as part of the OfficeVision* announcement) IBM announced an
extended role for the programmable workstation in the SAA environments.
 Part of this announcement, known as CUA 89, introduced the Workplace extension
to CUA's graphical model.  This workplace environment defined a more object-oriented
approach to interaction with the system through direct manipulation of objects.

<P>
In September 1991 IBM announced extensions to the SAA architecture. Included
in these extensions was CUA 91, an orderly growth from CUA 89.  CUA 91 enhances
the object-based user interface defined in CUA 89.  Rather than interacting
with applications, users interact with <A HREF="268_L2_object.html"><B>objects
</B></A>which represent the inputs and outputs of their jobs.  The Workplace
Environment is based upon the metaphor of the  user's working environment,
with objects such as forms, letters, an address book, printers etc., represented
on an electronic <A HREF="241_L2_desktop.html"><B>desktop</B></A> using
graphical symbols known as <A HREF="256_L2_icon.html"><B>icons.</B></A>
<P>
CUA 91 has an increased emphasis on <A HREF="242_L2_directmanipulation.html"><B>direct
manipulation</B></A>; that is, the manipulation of workplace objects through
their representative icons on the desktop.  This allows the user to concentrate
more on the task at hand, and less on the mechanism that must be employed.
 The user is presented with a number of icons, each of which is a pictorial
representation of the real underlying object which in fact controls the
data.
<P>
CUA 91 also introduces a number of new controls.  Perhaps the most noticeable
of these is the <A HREF="266_L2_notebookcontrol.html"><B>notebook control</B></A>.
 This control allows an application to present a multi-page dialog (for
example, a pad of blank forms, a log or register, or a set of reference
notes). The notebook control provides a more meaningful way of providing
an electronic metaphor of complex objects than a series of dialog boxes
or other secondary windows.
<P>
Extensive documentation for CUA 91 exists in the form of the<I> IBM Systems
Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide to User Interface Design</I> and
the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Interface Design
Reference.</I>  However, the best way to appreciate the spirit behind CUA
91 is to view the demonstration "The CUA Vision - Bringing the Future into
Focus."  This demonstration is based on a version of CUA beyond CUA 91.
 It does, however, bring home very vividly the essence of CUA 91: pervasive
interaction with workplace objects (represented by icons and other graphical
controls) through direct selection and manipulation.  As will be seen in
this demonstration, the user is not aware of applications as such. Business
processes are completed as a result of a natural and meaningful interaction
with objects.
