<H1>File Extended Attributes</H1><!-- entering slot 239 -->
<P>
File settings are stored in extended attribute (EA) files. EAs are automatically
created if the file was created using one of the WPS templates, but not
if the file was copied or created directly from a command prompt.
<P>
If the<I> Settings</I> view is opened and the EAs do not exist, then they
are created at that time. When any of the settings are changed, the EAs
are updated. This is done when a page on the notebook is changed and when
the<I> Settings</I> view is closed The settings information in a file's
EAs looks like this:
<PRE>EA #: 1  NameLen: 10  Name: &gt;.CLASSINFO&lt; ValueLen: 142
.........w...WPDataFile..rJ..rJ.-sJ.g.....T.WPObject.............

EA #: 2  NameLen: 9  Name: &gt;.LONGNAME&lt; ValueLen: 15
....Test 1 File

EA #: 3  NameLen: 8  Name: &gt;.SUBJECT&lt; ValueLen: 27
....Test file for LAN stuff

EA #: 4  NameLen: 5  Name: &gt;.TYPE&lt; ValueLen: 34
..........Plain Text....BASIC Code

EA #: 5  NameLen: 5  Name: &gt;.ICON&lt; ValueLen: 4070

Contents of File Extended Attributes
<P>
The file EAs are used to store:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Classinfo</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> This contains the WPS class to
which the object belongs. This ensures that the correct WPS methods are
used to instantiate the object when the folder is opened. Any new programs
added to the file menu are also stored here.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Longname
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>This contains the descriptive text that is displayed
below the icon. This is needed for FAT file systems where filenames are
restricted to 8 characters plus 3 for the file extension.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Subject
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>This data is entered in the "Subject" field
of the<I> Settings</I> view.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Type</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> This
records the file type of the object. A file can have multiple file types.
They are used to provide an association with a program through the OS2.INI
file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Icon</B><!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> This stores
the new icon used by the object if the user decides to replace the default
icon. Note that if he chooses to "Create" a new icon, 1014 bytes are used,
whereas if he "Edits" or  "Finds" an icon, 4070 bytes are needed.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
File EAs can shrink as well as grow. The disk space needed for the EAs grows
as options are chosen but if the choices are removed later the EAs size
will be reduced.
