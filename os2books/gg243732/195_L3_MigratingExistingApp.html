<H1>Migrating Existing Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 210 -->
<P>
Many OS/2 users will find themselves with existing PM applications that
they have developed, and may wonder whether they can modify them to exploit
the Workplace Shell environment.  Ideally, one would like every application
to be built as a collection of WPS objects, interacting with one another
and with the standard WPS objects, but many users will decide that converting
existing PM programs to this application model is not justified.
<P>
There are two approaches one may take to application migration:  one is
simply to make a few minor modifications so that the application works better
in the new environment,  the other is to convert the whole program to the
WPS/SOM application model, carrying over as much code from the PM version
as possible.
<P>
<B>Minimal Changes</B>
<P>
A particularly useful facility provided by the Workplace Shell is<I> Association</I>;
this can be by file type, filename or extension. A program may be associated
with one or more data files. The effect of this is that the program concerned
automatically becomes one of the views available from the<I> Open</I> action
on the context menu of any file with this type. Opening this view causes
the associated program to be started with the filename as its first command
line parameter.
<P>
Many programs that operate on files are written to expect a filename as
their first parameter, so these programs can be used in the Workplace Shell
environment in a way that is consistent with the object-oriented user interface
- the user chooses the object he wants to work on and opens it;  the window
presented by the program can be thought of as a view of the object.
<P>
Any program that does not accept a filename as a command-line parameter
can easily be modified to do so.
<P>
Other changes that could be considered:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Change the way the program ends, so that by default
it saves its data back into the file from which it read it.  This is more
consistent with the way a Workplace Shell object allows you to open a view,
make changes, then close the view, without having explicitly to save the
data first.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Replace the menu bar with a context menu.  This may
or may not be desirable - menu bars are still a quite acceptable part of
the user interface and are required by CUA 91, but are little used within
Workplace Shell itself.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Implement some simple direct manipulation - doing
this for printing can be very straightforward, and makes the program fit
much better into the Workplace Shell environment.
<P>
Supporting drag/drop for files, even in a limited way, can be very helpful.
 As an illustration, consider the Enhanced Editor provided with OS/2. This
is a standard PM program but you can drag WPS data file objects from any
folder and drop them on the open editor - the result is that the file is
added to the edit ring (the list of files currently being edited).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the program offers several tailoring options for
the application, implement a<I> Settings</I> view, similar to those provided
by WPS objects.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If the application includes many large dialogs, currently
using separate dialog boxes<!-- entering slot 211 --> invoked from the menu
bar, consider replacing these with a notebook control - it can make a complex
application seem a lot simpler.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Add an ASSOCTABLE statement to the program's resource
script file. This statement sets up associations for the program so that
the user is relieved of the need to do it himself, and also provides the
only way to add new file types to those provided by the system.  For details
of this see "Using an ASSOCTABLE to Add New File Types" below.
<P>
This statement allows for associations based on file extension, but our
recommendation is to use file types as they provide greater flexibility
for the user.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->If necessary, modify the program so that it behaves
well when provided with an empty input file.  For example, if the program
normally expects the contents of its files to have some pre-defined structure,
make the program set up this structure automatically if it reads an empty
input file, rather than issue a message complaining that the file is invalid.

<P>
The reason for this change is that we want the user to be able to start
a new file by first dragging a new object of an appropriate type from the
<I>Templates</I> folder, then opening it to start the application program.
 Typically, the new file will be empty at this stage, so the program must
recognize and accept that the user has chosen to start a new one.  Many
existing PM programs expect the user to start a new file by selecting<I> New
</I>from the<I> File</I> menu and will only load those files that already
contain valid data.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
For PM programs that operate on whole files, like word processors and spreadsheets,
very good results can be achieved with these simple techniques, without
ever having to write any SOM code. With a template file available, and associations
already set up, all the user need do to start working on a new file (document,
spreadsheet, or whatever it is), is to drag a new one from the template
and open it.  The program will start, presenting the user with a view of
the data, and when he is finished working on it, he can close the view (that
is, the program), and the data is saved automatically.
<P>
<B>An Illustration</B>
<P>
Let us illustrate this with a simple example.  We have an existing PM program
that is an expenses calculator.  When it starts it presents an empty window
with a menu bar that has two actions -<I> File</I> and<I> Process</I>.  With
the File action the user can elect to start a new expenses form, load an
existing one from disk, save the current one to disk, or to exit.  The Process
pull-down menu includes actions to calculate totals, to print the current
form, or to send it to the cashier for processing.
<P>
Let us see how we might modify this application to work in a way that is
consistent with the Workplace Shell user interface:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Add an ASSOCTABLE statement to the program's
resource script file, associating the program with the new type:<I> Expense
Form</I>.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Modify the program so that it expects a filename
as its first command line parameter and automatically loads an expense form
from the named file.  If the program finds that the input file is empty
it should start a new expense form.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Modify the program so that when<!-- entering slot 212 --> closed
it automatically saves the current data into the file it read in when started
(after prompting the user to confirm that this is what he wants).<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Take the actions currently on the menu bar and
implement them in a context menu  displayed when the user presses Mouse
Button 2.  Provide an option for the user to turn off the menu bar, which
is now redundant.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Provide the user with installation instructions
that tell him to copy the .EXE file onto his disk and create a Program object
referring to it.  This will ensure that the<I> Expense form</I> file type
is added to his system, and that an Expense form template file is created.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
Now the user can start a new expense form by dragging one from the template
in the<I> Templates</I> folder and double-clicking on it to start working
with it. The context menu will then let the user calculate totals, print
the form or send the form off for processing.
<P>
This is still not perfect; the user may well expect, as with real Workplace
Shell objects, to be able to access the context menu from the object itself,
not just from a view of it. This can be put right by making two copies of
the program, and modifying them as follows:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The first should be modified so that it only prints
forms<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The second should be modified so that it only sends
forms for processing.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These programs will be easy to produce since they already contain all the
required function.  All that needs to be changed is to make them perform
their specific functions automatically when started, and to remove extraneous
code.
<P>
Since a large amount of code may now be duplicated between the three programs,
it may be worth restructuring them so that common functions reside in a
DLL accessible to all three. This provides significant benefits for run-time
performance and program maintenance.
<P>
The user working with an expense form file will now find its context menu
contains actions to open a form (which will start the main program), to
print a form (which will invoke the new print program), and to send the
form off for processing (which will invoke the other new program).  These
actions are also available from within the main program when the user is
actually working on the form.
<P>
The user may find it odd that all these actions appear under the<I> Open
</I>action in the context menu.  This could be improved by removing the
association from the Print and Send programs, and manually adding menu items
to the template expense form file to invoke these programs.
<P>
The user will also find that he cannot print by direct manipulation of the
file itself. If the user drags the Expense Form object onto a printer, it
will print as a text file. There is no way that our print program can be
invoked automatically to format the data in this situation. The only solution
to this would be to develop a new WPS class, derived from<I> WPDataFile</I>,
that overrides the<I> wpPrintObject</I> message. Then, when the object is
asked to print itself, (typically in response to having been dropped on
a printer object), it will invoke the print program to provide the required
formatting. Developing this class would not involve<!-- entering slot 213 --> very
much work, but would require the programmer to be familiar with WPS and
SOM programming.
<P>
With only minor exceptions the expense form file object now behaves almost
exactly as it might if it had been implemented as a new Workplace Shell
class derived from WPDataFile, when in fact it is simply an ordinary data
file with some associated PM programs.
<P>
<B>Using an ASSOCTABLE to Add New File Types</B>
<P>
The scenario described above requires that a new file type be added to every
user's system - in the example its name was<I> Expense form</I>. This section
explains how to do this for your own program. An alternative approach that
is suitable for users and administrators can be found in <A HREF="174_L3_AddingNewFileTypes.html">Adding
New File Types</A>.
<P>
The standard programming technique to do this involves the ASSOCTABLE statement
in a program's resource script file. (This is one of the source files that
a programmer creates when developing a PM program - for more information
about this see<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>).
 This statement defines associations for the program being developed, in
terms of either file type, filename or extension. The file type can be anything
you choose, regardless of whether it is one of the existing file types defined
within OS2.INI. In the case of the example above, the<I> Expense form</I> file
type may be used in the ASSOCTABLE statement, despite the fact that at that
time it is not a type known to OS/2.
<P>
An ASSOCTABLE suitable for this example is shown in <A HREF="046_L2_AnASSOCTABLEResource.html">Figure
"An ASSOCTABLE Resource Script File Statement"</A>. The first quoted string
gives a file type to be used for association with this program;  the second
string allows for association by filename or extension (if you want to use
only association by file type, an empty string may be specified here); the
third parameter specifies that we want this program to be automatically
associated with data files with this type; the last parameter specifies
an icon to be used for representing data files that have this attribute.

<P>
When the program has been built, the<I> Settings</I> view for the executable
file shows, on its Associations page, that associations have been set up
for the specified file type(s) - in our case<I> Expense form</I>.
<P>
At this stage, however, there is no way you can create a data file with
this file type - when you open the Type page of a data file's<I> Settings
</I>view you find that<I> Expense form</I> is not one of the available types.

<P>
To achieve this you must create a Program object that refers to the executable
file that you just created.  (The usual way to do this is to drag a Program
object from the Program template in the<I> Templates</I> folder, then insert
the executable file's path and filename into the "Program" page of its<I> Settings
</I>view). This registers the program to the Workplace Shell, which finds
that the program includes a type for association, and adds this to its list
of available file types. It also adds a template file for this type to the
<I>Templates</I> folder.
<P>
The new types are then available to be added to any data files on the system
and new files of these types can be created by the user at any time simply
by dragging from the corresponding templates.
<P>
<B>Converting a PM Program to WPS/SOM</B>
<P>
To convert an existing PM application to be a<!-- entering slot 214 --> full
SOM/WPS application may require a great deal of work, depending on how well
structured the program is to begin with.
<P>
Much of the code can probably be preserved - when a WPS object wants to
display a window, it does so using normal PM facilities to create the window
and has to provide a normal PM window procedure to support it;  most of
this code may be transferred directly from the older program.  Similarly,
any application processing code - for example for database access, communications,
or calculation should be equally applicable to the new version.
<P>
The steps necessary to make the conversion include:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Consider the split between function that will be implemented
as WPS objects (with all the drawbacks of running in the WPS process), and
function that will be implemented in separate processes.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Devise the interprocess communications (IPC) protocols
to be used between the two parts of the application.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Design the revised user interface.  Although much
may be preserved, there will inevitably be design changes needed to make
the application work well for the user in the new environment.  These may
include:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Increased emphasis on the use of icons to represent
the data items manipulated by the application<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Changes to terminology used (for example, "views"
rather than "windows")<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Use of container windows where list boxes may previously
have been used<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Replacing complex dialogs with notebook controls<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Adding context menus.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Add
the capability for the program to save its state when closed so that, the
next time it is started, the program's options, settings, its window position
and so on are the same as the last time it was run.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Provide
a way for the user to retrieve application windows that have been minimized.
 Since in OS/2 Version 2.0 windows are not necessarily minimized onto the
desktop, it is possible that application windows that the program has not
added to the window list may be hard to restore. Such designs need to be
revised for OS/2 Version 2.0.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
