<H1>Objects On The Standard Desktop</H1><!-- entering slot 110 -->
<P>
In previous versions of OS/2 the icons represented applications, but in
the Workplace Shell they may represent both applications and objects. The
appearance of an object can be either "general" or "personal".
<P>
The general appearance is usually inherited from the class to which the
object belongs. There is no way, short of programming, to change the class
icons, such as folders and data files, which are shipped with the Workplace
Shell. However, any icon can be individually changed, or "personalized",
by the user. Icons which have been changed are stored in the <A HREF="245_L2_ExtendedAttributes.html"><I>Extended
Attributes</I></A> of the object.
<P>
When the user starts OS/2 V2.0, the following objects are visible on the
desktop:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>

container contains a directory listing of the diskette in drive A:.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
Most data objects are presented to the user in folders, which act as containers
to logically group sets of objects.  The objects within a folder may be
rearranged by the user, and objects may be moved or duplicated between folders,
allowing users to customize the desktop to suit their own working style.
A user may place commonly accessed objects onto the desktop itself to avoid
having to open a folder to access the required object. A typical example
of a desktop is shown in <A HREF="021_L2_SystemSetup.html">Figure "System
Setup"</A>.
