<H1>Workplace Shell and the System Object Model</H1><!-- entering slot 219 -->
<P>
The other major new feature of the Workplace Shell is that it is built on
an object-oriented platform, called the System Object Model (SOM). SOM enables
the WPS to be written as classes which inherit attributes from their superclasses
and provides a high degree of reusability and integrity to the WPS implementation.
Object-oriented programming and SOM are described more fully in <A HREF="181_L1_PresentationManagera.html">Presentation
Manager and Workplace Shell Application Development</A>.
