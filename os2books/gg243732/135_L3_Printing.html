<H1>Printing</H1><!-- entering slot 143 -->
<P>
The user wants to print specific types of output in an appropriate manner
on the right paper.  So it should not matter to him how the system gets
this done.  All that is important is that the output is directed to some
object that subsequently produces the desired printout. Therefore the concept
of logical printers in a print manager was changed to the concept of printer
objects.
<P>
A printer object represents a certain arrangement of hardware, software,
and specifications that are made to simplify the printing for the user.
So, if printing is needed on three different sizes or types of paper then
there will be three different printer objects, each for one specific type
of output.
<P>
<B>Local OS/2 Printing</B>
<P>
For local printing everything is installed on the individual workstation
and therefore it is simple to install a printer and the driver for it.  Other
printer objects directing different output to the same printer can be quickly
created using the Workplace Shell.
<P>
<B>Printing from DOS Programs</B>
<P>
The term<I> DOS Printing</I> refers to two different types of printing:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Printing from an OS/2 session with DOS-like commands
(that is, PRINT, TYPE, PrtScrn)<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Printing from DOS applications using DOS device
drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
As DOS printing does not happen from the Workplace Shell there are also
no icons to represent any destinations.  This also means that these functions
are done in the traditional way by setting up a printer from within applications.

<P>
DOS Programs are discussed in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 2:
 DOS and Windows Environment</I>.
<P>
<B>Remote Printing</B>
<P>
The process of remote printing can become a little bit more complicated
because the setup for the destination printer is done on the print server.
 For the local user, printer objects have to be created that reflect the
functions on the server.  In addition, the local printer object has to indicate
the status of the remote printer.
<P>
Printing is described in more detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 5:
 Print Subsystem</I>.
