Extended Attributes
<P>
Information which may be associated with a file under OS/2 Version 1.2 or
above (including Version 2.0), to indicate various properties of that file.
 Extended attributes are available with both the FAT and HPFS file systems.
 An application may define extended attributes for files which it creates,
and may update the extended attributes of files upon which it operates.
 A number of standard extended attributes are defined by the operating system
for commonly-used information.
