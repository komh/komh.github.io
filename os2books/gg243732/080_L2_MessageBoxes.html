<P>
A message box is a short-lived window, similar to a dialog box, which is
used to display a message to the user and to receive acknowledgement and
a simple decision from the user.  A message box is used to inform the user
of an event in situations where the information to be conveyed is relatively
simple, and the response returned by the user is limited to a single choice
from a finite set of options.  In such a case, the range of facilities provided
by a dialog box is not required.  Message boxes and their uses are discussed
in detail in<I> OS/2 Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>.
 An example of a message box is given in <A HREF="009_L2_PresentationManagerM.html">Figure
"Presentation Manager Message Box"</A>.
<P>
A message box displays an application-supplied text string, along with one
or more push buttons such as "OK", "Cancel", "Help", etc.  The user selects
one of these buttons in response to the text displayed in the message box.

<P>
As defined in the<I> IBM Systems Application Architecture CUA Advanced Guide
to User Interface Design</I>, a message box is a modal dialog with the user,
since the user is required to acknowledge and act upon the message before
continuing interaction.  Presentation Manager allows both<B> application-modal
</B>messages, which prohibit the user from interacting with any other window
in the same application before responding to the message, and<B> system-modal
</B>messages, which block interaction with any other window in the system
until the message has been acknowledged.
