<H1>Workplace Shell Objects and Applications</H1><!-- entering slot 202 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell provides a number of standard object classes such as
folders and data files. The user performs his work by interacting with these
objects using their context menus or direct manipulation.
<P>
In order to extend the range of tasks that a user can perform using the
Workplace Shell, it is necessary to add new object classes to his desktop;
 typically these may be related to specific productivity tools, such as
a<I> Spreadsheet</I> object, or to the user's own business, such as<I> Order
Form</I>,<I> Parts Catalog</I>, or<I> Customer</I>.
<P>
In the ideal, purely object-oriented, user interface, there would no longer
be anything that a user would recognize as a program -  there would only
be objects, all with their own unique behaviors and uses.  As long as the
user is provided with suitable tools (that is, object classes), he can work
out how to accomplish any particular task without having to learn to use
an application program specifically designed for that task. What we might
loosely call a  Workplace Shell application is really no more than a collection
of Workplace Shell object classes.
<P>
In order for a newly developed object class to be used, it must be registered
to the Workplace Shell. The classes are implemented in such a way that each
class, or possibly several classes, is contained in a dynamic link library
(DLL). Being in a DLL means that an object's methods can be called by Workplace
Shell whenever necessary, and also that the code can be shared between multiple
instances of the class.  Registering a new class informs the Workplace Shell
of the existence of the new class, and gives it the name of the DLL containing
its methods.
<P>
The Workplace Shell itself, and all its classes including any that a user
may develop, are written using the<I> System Object Model</I>, a language-independent
environment for object-oriented programming. Anyone wishing to develop new
Workplace Shell classes must therefore understand SOM, and also be familiar
with the existing Workplace Shell classes, from which his new classes must
inherit at least some of their behavior.
