<H1>Keeping the Desktop Separate from the System</H1><!-- entering slot 158 -->
<P>
When OS/2 is installed it sets up a directory called<I> OS!2 2.0 Desktop
</I>on the boot drive, corresponding to the desktop work area. In this directory
it installs some default objects for the user which the user can work with
to subsequently create new folders and other objects for himself.
<P>
The result is that user files are created on the same partition as the operating
system. Many users would prefer to keep their data and programs in a separate
partition from the operating systems, in case they have to format their
partition to install a new release of the operating system.
<P>
Fortunately, it is possible to move the desktop to another drive or partition,
though this can only be done after installation - the OS/2 install program
always puts it on the boot partition. The process to do this is simply:
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open the Drives object<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open a view of the drive on which the desktop
currently resides<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Drag the "OS!2 2.0 Desktop" directory object
to the drive you want it to be on.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
This will result in the desktop structure, with all its subdirectories,
being physically moved to the new drive or partition. All references in
OS2.INI to objects within the corresponding folders will be updated to reflect
the change.
<P>
If the user does have to reinstall his operating system, however, this approach
may cause other problems in rebuilding the desktop. Among the factors to
be considered are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->The WPS will install the desktop into the operating
system by default, so the user will now have two desktops<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Any folders created by the user will not be in the
new desktop<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Any programs created by the user will not be in the
new OS2.INI file<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Programs may be given new HOBJECTs by the WPS as it
installs them, so the HOBJECTs in the users directories will now be different
from those in the OS2.INI file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
The implementation of the Workplace Shell is discussed in <A HREF="197_L1_WorkplaceShellImplem.html">Workplace
Shell Implementation</A>; an understanding of the way in which WPS objects
are created and stored will help the user to decide how to structure his
system.
