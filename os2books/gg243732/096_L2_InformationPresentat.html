<P>
OS/2 Version 2.0 provides a number of enhancements to IPF in addition to
the capabilities available under OS/2 Version 1.3.  This section briefly
describes these enhancements; more complete information may be found in
the<I> IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 Information Presentation Reference</I>.
<P>
The <A HREF="257_L2_InformationPresentat.html"><B>Information Presentation
Facility</B> (<B>IPF</B>)</A> allows application developers to provide online,
context-sensitive help information for Presentation Manager applications.
 IPF also allows online manuals and documentation to be built and viewed
independently of applications.  Automatic table of contents, searching and
printing facilities are provided by IPF.
<P>
The<I> hypertext links</I> have been extended to include bitmaps and metafiles,
in addition to text phrases.  These hypergraphic links provide enhanced
flexibility for the display of online documentation, particularly procedure
manuals and tutorials.  Hypergraphic links may be used to display additional
information, send a message to an application, or start a new process in
a similar manner to hypertext links.
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, links may be made between panels which reside in
different source files; these files are concatenated and the resulting information
may be viewed as a single entity.  Both hypertext and hypergraphic links
are supported in this manner.  This enables larger amounts of information
to be viewed, and allows the separation of volatile information into separate
files for easier update.
<P>
The split screen support provided by IPF under OS/2 Version 2.0 allows a
window to be regarded as <A HREF="295_L2_viewport.html"><B>multiple viewports</B></A>,
each of which may be manipulated separately by the author and the user.

<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, all windows are composed of one or more viewports.
 The default viewport is simply the entire window.  IPF Version 2.0 allows
<A HREF="295_L2_viewport.html"><B>secondary viewports</B></A> to be opened,
to display related information which may be scrolled and manipulated separately
from the parent information.
<P>
IPF provides two different types of viewport within a window:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->IPF-controlled (IC) viewports are created, controlled
and manipulated by IPF in a similar way to normal IPF windows.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->Application-controlled (AC) viewports are controlled
by the application, and are typically used for the display of specialized
information.  For example, an AC viewport might be used to display animation
or full-motion video.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
These different types of viewports may be mixed within the same parent window.

<P>
Dynamic data formatting allows applications to place customized information
in help windows or online documents at run time. For example, this facility
could be used in a help window to display the data from a current transaction
to the user, along with the required steps to complete that transaction.
 The help information is thereby made more relevant to the immediate task.

<P>
IPF allows items within help windows to be defined as <A HREF="255_L2_hypertext.html"><B>hypertext</B></A>.
When the user selects such items, actions may be triggered (for example,
opening another help window to display more detailed explanatory text, posting
a message back to the application's window procedure to invoke an application
event, or starting another process under OS/2).
<P>
Under OS/2 Version 2.0, IPF supports the use of multiple fonts within help
windows or online documentation, as well as multiple character sizes for
each font.  By default, all help windows and online documentation windows
appear in the system font.  The Courier, Helvetica (Helv), and Times Roman
(Tms Rmn) fonts are available in all display adapters supported by Presentation
Manager.  Where the specified size is not available for the required font,
the closest match is used.
