<P>
The structure of the WPS is heavily dependent on the critical system files:
CONFIG.SYS, OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI. This chapter described several approaches
to backing up and recovering these files.
<P>
The Workplace Shell is capable of being tailored to meet a variety of user
environments. Restricting the functions provided to the inexperienced user
results in a logical, consistent interface that is simple to learn and to
use. The installation of such a user environment was described, together
with some notes on the OS/2 V2.0 functions needed to support that user.

<P>
For the advanced user, OS/2 V2.0 provides a wealth of new techniques to
help him become more productive. Several techniques are available to let
the advanced user modify his environment, including adding programs to object
menus. In addition, some REXX utilities have been provided to help the advanced
user or administrator to modify the default operating characteristics of
the WPS.
<P>
Installing and customizing stand-alone workstations is only part of the
administrator's brief.  Many factors must be considered, including disk
partitioning, problem determination and overall system performance. LAN
integration is a major enhancement to OS/2 V2.0 but this, too, must be carefully
planned to ensure that the environment created really does meet the needs
of the users.
