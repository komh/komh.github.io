<H1>Giving OS/2 V2.0 the Look and Feel of OS/2 Version 1.3</H1><!-- entering slot 152 -->
<P>
Users of earlier versions of OS/2 or of Microsoft Windows may not feel entirely
at home when they first start the system. The graphical user interface (GUI)
they are familiar with has been replaced by an object-oriented user interface
(OOUI) which, while providing a clear, logical layout is very different.
In general, if a user thinks about objects rather than programs, he will
find it much easier to learn to use the WPS interface to its full extent.

<P>
One of the big differences is that previously a user could start a new application,
browse through the menus and scan the possible choices. This way it was
fast and fairly easy to grasp the various functions of a program.  With
the Workplace Shell, however, many functions are not program-specific functions
any more but general capabilities of almost all objects.  It also means
that certain functions are not needed any more in menus; they just exist
as OS/2 functions.  For example, the choice of a color or a font does not
need to be in the menus of each program, the<I> System Setup</I> folder
provide all the choices the user needs.
<P>
If a user prefers the style of OS/2 Version 1.3 he can customize the system
through the use of the .RC files that come with the installation diskettes.
 The procedure is fairly simple and can be done after the completion of
a normal installation:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Boot the system from the "Installation" diskette
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Use diskette 1 as directed<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Exit from the "Welcome" screen<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Change drive and current directory to C:\OS2
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Modify OS2.INI with the command:
<PRE>MAKEINI OS2.INI OS2_13.RC</PRE>
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Restart the system.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<BR>

<P>
If you want to change back just follow the same procedure but make the OS2.INI
modification with the command:
<PRE>MAKEINI OS2.INI OS2_20.RC
</PRE>

<P>
You should note, however, that the MAKEINI command generates a new OS2.INI
file from the resource files which were shipped with the system. This means
that the OS2.INI file is restored to the same state as when OS/2 V2.0 was
first installed and any customization performed by the user, either to the
Workplace Shell or the PM 1.3 shell, will be lost.
