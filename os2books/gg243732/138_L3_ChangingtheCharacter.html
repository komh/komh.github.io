<H1>Changing the Characteristics of an Object</H1><!-- entering slot 146 -->
<P>
The<I> Settings</I> view for an object can be used to change characteristics
such as color, font and icon bitmap, as well as other application-specific
properties such as use of a menu bar or a context menu.
<P>
The user may also change some attributes such as color and font by opening
the color and font dialogs in the<I> OS/2 System</I> folder and dragging
the desired color or font to the object.  If the color or font is dragged
to the<I> Templates</I> folder, then the default settings are altered for
all new objects created from the templates.
<P>
As well as allowing the user to change the attributes of an object to be
different from its parent, it also allows him to undo this so that the object
inherits from its parent again. For example, if a color scheme is dropped
on a folder, that folder will differ from the desktop. If a different scheme
is then dropped onto the desktop via Alt-drag, that folder's attributes
do not change.
<P>
To get the folder to forget its color settings and inherit the desktop color
scheme again, just drag the same scheme that was used for the desktop onto
the folder with Alt-drag, that is, the same mechanism that was used to set
the desktop colors. The folder will release its presentation parameters
and accept the system default parameters which have been dragged to it.
Any future changes to the desktop color settings will now be inherited by
that folder.
