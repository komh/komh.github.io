<P>
The client area of a window contains information which is specific to the
application, and thus the contents and layout of the client area will vary
from one application to the next.  To preserve the ideal of a consistent
user interface, however, Presentation Manager provides a number of standard
<B>control windows</B> which may be used to display and receive information
to and from the user.
<P>
For further information about control windows see <A HREF="081_L2_ControlWindows.html">Control
Windows</A>.
