<H1>File Dialogs</H1><!-- entering slot 101 -->
<P>
There are two standard dialogs provided for file manipulation: the<I> Open
</I>dialog and the<I> Save as</I> dialog.  Each provides similar function,
but has slightly different behavior due to the different function being
performed with the dialog. The use of these dialogs enables application
developers to provide these functions in a consistent manner, without having
to code such function into their application programs.
<P>
The standard "Open" dialog box, used to select and open directories and
files from within an application, is shown in <A HREF="017_L2_StandardFileDialogfo.html">Figure
"Standard File Dialog for "Open""</A>.
<P>
The file dialogs are required by application-oriented programs wishing to
conform to the 1991 CUA guidelines. By standardizing the commonly performed
file manipulation tasks across different programs, they help to eliminate
minor inconsistencies in dialog operation, which results in fewer user errors.
