<P>
The<I> Drives</I> icon opens to a view of all disk drives in the system;
these are called<I> Drive</I> icons. After "login" to the LAN, any network
drives assigned to the user will also be shown here.
<P>
<I>Drive</I> icons are container objects which display the contents of the
directories available to the user. A<I> Drive</I> object represents the
"disk partition" and is, therefore, an abstract, non-copyable object. When
a<I> Drive</I> icon is opened, the same<I> Drive</I> icon is seen within
it; the difference is that the icon now represents the root directory of
that partition and is copyable. Thus a root folder can be copied but a disk
partition can't.
<P>
<A HREF="024_L2_LocalDrivesandLANDri.html">Figure "Local Drives and LAN
Drives"</A> shows the drives folder after Login.
<P>
Directories contain, as before, data, programs and so on.  Information pertaining
to some of the files may, however, be stored in the OS2.INI file as described
in <A HREF="197_L1_WorkplaceShellImplem.html">Workplace Shell Implementation</A>.
Copying or deleting a file is therefore a non-trivial exercise for OS/2
V2.0 and should be done through the Workplace Shell to ensure integrity.
The folder mechanism allows files to be moved and copied within the subdirectories
of the main desktop directory. The<I> Drive</I> icons provide the equivalent
mechanism for all the directories accessible to the user.
<P>
More information can be seen through the<I> Settings</I> view. This makes
it easy for the end user but harder for the administrator who now needs
to understand much more about how the system works.
<P>
The<I> Drives</I> folder is, partially, what the File Manager was in OS/2
Version 1.3. The main differences stem from the object-oriented view which
is different from the hierarchical nature of the PM File Manager. The only
hierarchy visible is in the tree view of a drive or a folder.
<P>
"Sort" can be selected in both the details and icon views. The sort criteria
here are different from the purely filename-oriented view of the File Manager
because the extension of a filename has limited importance. The<I> type
</I>of a file is determined by either OS/2 V2.0 or by the user. It can then
be used to sort the folder contents.
<P>
For example, when "sort by type" is selected, all executable files are in
one group and are sorted by name within that group.  This block can thus
include files with the extensions EXE, CMD and COM mixed within it.
<P>
The drives folders do not display only the files contained in a directory.
They also show any shadow copies or program references which may exist in
the folder associated with that directory. Folders are linked to subdirectories
of the main desktop directory. This information is stored in the OS2.INI
file, as described in <A HREF="217_L2_TheOS2INIFile.html">The OS2.INI File</A>,
and in the directory Extended Attributes (EAs). This applies to both local
objects on the workstation and objects on the LAN drives used by the workstation.
