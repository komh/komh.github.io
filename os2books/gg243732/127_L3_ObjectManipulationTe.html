<H1>Object Manipulation Techniques</H1><!-- entering slot 134 -->Any movement of the mouse or any key causes some
message that usually results in some selection or manipulation. Manipulation
can be a copy, a change in appearance, an activation, or some other form
of action.
<P>
<B>Traditional Approach</B>
<P>
Though the move from the command-line interface to the full-screen interface
(with or without drop-down menus) changed the way of operation to an object-action
sequence of work, the Workplace Shell is even more different.
<P>
Let's take two examples.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Copy a file.  This involves:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Marking a file<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Activating a menu or function key<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Naming the destination<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Performing the operation<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Updating references, profiles, paths, and other related
data.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>Change
colors.  This requires the user to:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Select
a function from a menu<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Define
the appearance of the screen or window<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Activate
the changes for the whole application.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Drag and Drop</B>
<P>
The most obvious way to act on an object is by dragging and dropping its
icon using mouse button 2, sometimes called "direct manipulation". The user
presses mouse button 1 to select objects and mouse button 2 to drag and
drop them. The user simply moves the cursor to the object to be manipulated,
depresses mouse button 2 to start the drag, holds the mouse button down
while moving the cursor to the target, then releases mouse button 2 to drop
the object.
<P>
Using drag and drop to perform the same actions described above takes just
a few simple steps in OS/2 V2.0:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Copy a file:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Make the file to be copied visible<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Make the destination visible<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Point with the mouse at the file object, depress mouse
button 2 and drag the object to the destination<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->Drop the object.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>
<P>
OS/2 does almost all changes to related data for you, such as changing information
about a shadow copy.  Some information, like a changed path, has to be updated
manually.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>  2.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
<UL>Change colors
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Display the color palette
or the scheme palette<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Display
the object to be colored<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
</UL> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>Drag
the color icon or the scheme icon to the object and drop it.<!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->
</UL> The
coloring can be done on an object basis or on an application basis.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
If an icon is dragged to a printer, the contents of the object are printed.
 If the object is a file, then the file's contents are printed; if it is
a folder, then a list of the folder's contents is produced.  In the same
way, dropping an icon on the shredder deletes the object, while dropping
it on a folder, workplace or diskette moves it into that object.
<P>
The concept of direct manipulation implies that certain types of objects
may be dropped in certain locations.  For example, a printer object cannot
be dropped over another printer object, since it is logically impossible
to print a printer.  It is therefore necessary to provide some form of indication
as to whether a "drop" is allowed on a particular object.
<P>
This is done visually, by altering the appearance of the icon representing
the object being dragged, whenever a drop operation is<I> not</I> permitted.
 When the icon is moved over an object or location where a drop<I> is</I> permitted,
the destination object shows a box around it. However, this does not mean
that the target object will actually be able to correctly<!-- entering slot 135 --> handle
the object to be dropped.
<P>
As some of the functions cannot be done with just the two mouse buttons
it may be necessary to use the Alt-, the Ctrl- or the Shift-key as a<I> modifier.
</I> For example, depressing the Ctrl-key when dragging an object causes
a copy instead of a move operation.
