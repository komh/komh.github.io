<H1>System Object Model</H1><!-- entering slot 203 -->
<P>
The System Object Model (SOM) is a language-independent specification for
object-oriented programming (OOP). It consists of a set of utilities and
interfaces for creating objects. This section provides a brief introduction
to the System Object Model; for a more complete explanation, see<I> OS/2
Version 2.0 - Volume 4:  Application Development</I>. That document also
contains a fuller discussion of OOP concepts.
<P>
SOM implements all the essentials of OOP, including inheritance, encapsulation
and polymorphism. Objects are organized into classes in a hierarchical manner
and subclasses may inherit behaviors and characteristics from their parent
(or<I> super</I>) classes.
<P>
SOM is language-independent. With suitable bindings any programming language
may be used to implement the methods of an object class. For example, a
class written in COBOL could then be used or even subclassed by another
class written in Smalltalk/V**. However, so far the only language for which
such bindings are available is C.
<P>
One of the great benefits of  building WPS objects using SOM is that SOM
implements the concept of<I> inheritance</I>.  All objects are grouped into
classes, and characteristics and behavior common to more than one class
can be defined as methods in a superclass which are then inherited by all
child (or<I> sub</I>) classes. Many common methods such as these are defined
at the system level, in object classes supplied with OS/2 V2.0, and may
be inherited by application-specific object classes.
<P>
An application developer may choose to enhance a system-supplied method:
for example, providing a more advanced level of drag/drop functionality
to a Workplace Shell object class. The developer may create a new object
class as a subclass of the system-supplied object class.  The subclass need
override<I> only</I> those methods that are invoked in drag/drop operations.
 Other methods may simply be inherited from the super class.
<P>
It is important to understand that SOM is a general-purpose implementation
of object-oriented programming, and may be used for any OOP programming
under OS/2.  On the other hand, the class hierarchy it provides is very
limited, consisting as it does of only three classes, so a great deal of
work would be required to implement classes if SOM were to be used for general-purpose
object-oriented programming.  In practice the only use to which most programmers
will put the SOM is in developing the Workplace Shell objects that will
form part of their applications.
<P>
<B>OIDL and the SOM Compiler</B>
<P>
Non-OOP languages such as C lack the language constructs for defining the
classes, methods, instance data and so on that are needed when developing
OOP objects. Even OOP languages which are designed for this can only do
so for applications that are implemented entirely in one language. For these
reasons, SOM provides its own language for defining classes, called<I> Object
Interface Definition Language (OIDL)</I>.  The details of a class, its instance
variables, methods and the name of its superclass, are all defined using
OIDL, and are placed in a file known as the<I> Class Definition File</I>.

<P>
The class definition file is used as input to the<I> SOM compiler</I>, which
uses the information to generate several new files, such as C header files,
a module definition file to be used when linking the object, and a skeleton
C<!-- entering slot 204 --> source file containing a prototype function
for each method defined in the OIDL.  The programmer inserts the application
function he requires into this source file to implement the methods he wants,
and then compiles and links the program in the usual way to produce DLL
containing the object class.
<P>
A class definition file contains the following sections:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Include Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This section consists of
a statement to include the class definition file of the parent class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Parent
Class Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This section defines certain
basic information about a new class, such as its name and release level,
and, by convention, comments that describe its position in the class hierarchy.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Release Order Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This
section is used to allow a programmer to specify in which order the methods
and public data of his class will be released.  This can be important if
the class is subsequently subclassed;  without the release order having
been specified, it could prove necessary to recompile the parent class in
that case.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Metaclass Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This
optional section is used to give information about the class's metaclass
(that is, the class of which the new class is itself to be an instance).
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Passthru Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This
section allows a programmer to include some programming language code that
will be placed by the SOM compiler into the language source file it generates.
It is typically used for such things as<I> typdef</I> and<I> #define</I> statements.
<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B>Data Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This
section specifies the instance variables to be used by the class.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Methods
Section</B><!-- lm: 0x12 29 -->
<UL> This section lists all the methods
which are to be defined by the class, both those that are new to the class
and those of its parent class that it will be overriding.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
