<H1>Changing the Default View on "Open"</H1><!-- entering slot 148 -->
<P>
The Workplace Shell allows users to change the default view of an object
(that is, the view that opens when it is double clicked on). The "Open"
entry in a primary menu is usually the only one that allows additions because
it is application-oriented.  Once "Open" or one of the added entries is
selected, the cascaded menu of this entry is addressed by the lower part
of the notebook page.  Here the actual program names have to be entered
under "Actions on menu".  After entries have been made here it is recommended
that an existing choice be selected as the default option.
<P>
For example, a user might want to change the<I> Drive</I> folder and objects
so that the default view is "Details" instead of "Icons".  The following
steps are used:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Open the<I> Settings</I> view and go to the "Menu"
page. This page contains "Primary pop-up menu" and "Open" headings.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select "Open", then press the adjacent "Settings"
button.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Select the cascade arrow next to "Default action",
then pick the new default view you want to use when you subsequently double
click on the icon.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Click on the "OK" push button.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->Close the<I> Settings</I> view.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
