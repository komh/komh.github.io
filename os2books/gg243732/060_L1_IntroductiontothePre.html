OS/2* Version 2.0 brings new levels of computing power to users' desktops,
and is designed to deliver this power to a very wide range of users, many
of whom may have little experience with computers.
<P>
Power and sophistication could mean complexity for the user, but OS/2 Version
2.0 has been provided with an advanced user interface designed to provide
users with this power in a way that is easy to learn and, as far as possible,
intuitive, enabling them to make the most of their investment in hardware
and software.
<P>
The components of OS/2 Version 2.0 that provide this user interface are
Presentation Manager* and the Workplace Shell*. These are the subjects of
this document.
