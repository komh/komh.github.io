This document gives a description of the functions and facilities provided
by the Presentation Manager and Workplace Shell in OS/2 Version 2.0 and
their implementation.

The document discusses the migration of Presentation Manager applications
from previous versions of OS/2 and the considerations for deciding whether
to implement new applications as Presentation Manager or as Workplace Shell
applications.
<P>
This document is intended for planners and technical support personnel who
require an understanding of the function provided by the Presentation Manager
and Workplace Shell in OS/2 Version 2.0, and the implementation of that
function.
