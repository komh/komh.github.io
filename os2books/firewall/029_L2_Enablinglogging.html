<H1>Enabling logging</H1><!-- entering slot 29 -->
<P>
In order to enable logging, the <A HREF="048_L2_CFGFILT.html">CFGFILT</A> command
must be run with the '-d' parameter:
<BR>

<PRE>    cfgfilt -d start
</PRE>

<P>
The 'start' parameter is optional. 
<P>
This command may be run at any time.  However, the easiest way to enable
logging is to include the '-d' parameter when packet filtering is first
activated (using the '-u' and '-i' parameters), i.e.
<BR>

<PRE>    cfgfilt -u -i -d
</PRE>

<P>
This command would presumably be called from one of the TCP/IP startup routines.
(Refer to the section <A HREF="003_L2_Startingthefirewall.html">Starting
the firewall</A> for more information.) 
<P>
When logging is enabled, the CFGFILT command, when run with no parameters,
should show the following near the top of its output:
<BR>

<PRE>    Status of packet logging : enabled.
</PRE>
 
<P>

<P>
The log daemon
<P>
In order to use logging, the <A HREF="049_L2_FSSD.html">log daemon</A> must
be running.  This is a server process which handles logging requests from
the filter device driver, and writes the appropriate entries into a log
file. 
<P>
The log daemon may be started manually by using the command:
<BR>

<PRE>    fssd
</PRE>

<P>
However, in most cases it is more convenient to start the log daemon automatically
during system startup.  This may be done by adding the following line to
<I>x</I>:\TCPIP\BIN\TCPEXIT.CMD (where x is the drive on which TCP/IP is
installed):
<BR>

<PRE>    detach fssd.exe
</PRE>

<P>
Using the 'detach' command will cause the log daemon to run as a background
process. 
<P>
