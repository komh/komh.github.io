Proper use of logging is an important aspect of security.  To this end,
the firewall feature includes a logging function. 
<P>
Logging, like all other firewall functions, is based on filter rule configuration.
When logging is enabled, traffic which is processed by any filter rule which
has its <A HREF="022_L3_log.html">logging parameter</A> set to<B> yes</B> causes
a log entry to be created.
