<H1>Filter rules</H1><!-- entering slot 8 -->
<P>
Filter rules dictate what kinds of IP traffic are allowed into, out of,
or through the system.  When packet filtering is active, the firewall filter
driver intercepts every IP packet that passes through the TCP/IP stack,
and checks it against the current filter rules in order to determine whether
it should be allowed to continue.  If no rule can be found which matches
the packet, that packet is blocked. 
<P>
Any traffic which is to be allowed through<I> must</I> therefore match the
criteria defined by at least one active filter rule. 
<P>
This 'deny by default' behaviour can be altered by adding a filter rule
which explicitly permits all traffic.  Individual rules may then be added
which selectively deny certain types of traffic.  This would, in effect,
change the behaviour of the firewall to 'permit by default'.  (See the <A HREF="027_L2_Examples.html">Examples
</A>section for an illustration.)  If you wish to do this, keep in mind
that 'permit by default' is inherently a less-secure policy than 'deny by
default'.
