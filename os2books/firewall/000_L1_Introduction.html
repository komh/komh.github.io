This book describes the firewall feature which is built into the Multi-Protocol
Transport Services version 5.3 (WRx8600) and above. 
<P>
The firewall feature works by filtering IP traffic, allowing certains types
of traffic through while blocking other types.  This process is called <A HREF="007_L1_PacketFiltering.html">IP
packet filtering</A>. 
<P>
This feature is derived from the<B> IBM SecureWay Firewall</B> product,
parts of which have been ported from AIX along with the 32-bit TCP/IP stack.
 
<P>
In addition to packet filtering, <A HREF="034_L2_DefinitionofanIPSect.html">IPSec
tunnel</A> support has also been brought over from the SecureWay product.
 This feature allows you to connect to a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
 
<P>
The more advanced features of the full SecureWay product, such as Network
Address Translation or SOCKS server functionality, are not included.
