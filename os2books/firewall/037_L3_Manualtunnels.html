<H1>Manual tunnels</H1><!-- entering slot 38 -->
<P>
A manual tunnel is the basic tunnel type defined by the IPSec standards.
 
<P>
In theory, it should be possible to connect to any IPSec-compliant system
using a manual tunnel configuration.  However, whether this holds true depends
largely upon whether compatible tunnel parameters can be found. 
<P>
According to IBM RedBook SG24-5201-00:<I> A Comprehensive Guide to Virtual
Private Networks, Volume I: IBM Firewall, Server and Client Solutions</I>,
manual tunnel connections have been successfully tested with the following
IPSec platforms:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->IBM SecureWay (eNetwork) Firewall for AIX<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->AIX V4.3<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->OS/390 Server<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->SecureWay (eNetwork) Communications Suite for Windows
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->OS/2 with MPTS V5.3 or higher<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> 'SecureWay' is a rebranding of the 'eNetwork' product line.
The two brand names should be considered interchangeable.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

The main limitations of manual tunnels are:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The tunnel endpoints are defined in the configuration
files by IP address.  Each endpoint is therefore assumed to have a fixed
(static) address.  This is a reasonable assumption in the case of a server
or firewall; however, for single client workstations (especially those using
dial-up connections), this may not be feasible.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->There is no provision for automating the exchange
of encryption keys in advance. Since each endpoint must agree on an encryption
key and algorithm before a tunnel can be established, the VPN administrator
will need to arrange some means of exchanging this information manually.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For security reasons, these encryption keys have
limited lifespans (typically just a few hours).  There is no built-in mechanism
for renewing them once they expire.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol has now been developed in order
to address these issues.  However, an IKE implementation is not included
in the firewall. 
<P>
Without an IKE implementation, the only real way around these limitations
is to use <A HREF="038_L3_Dynamictunnels.html">dynamic tunnels</A>.
