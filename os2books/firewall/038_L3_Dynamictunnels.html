<P>
A dynamic tunnel is a special IBM tunnel implementation which allows a connection
based on the client's system name instead of its IP address.  It is also
capable of exchanging encryption keys automatically (using an SSL connection)
in advance of establishing a tunnel. 
<P>
This implementation was designed to accomodate clients which may not have
fixed IP addresses, such as those in a DHCP or dial-up environment. 
<P>
Dynamic tunnels of this type are not part of the IPSec standards, and may
only be used when connecting to an IBM SecureWay Firewall server. 
<P>
TCP/IP versions 4.1 and above include an optional <A HREF="054_L2_SRIP.html">VPN
client program</A> which may be used to establish dynamic tunnels to an
AIX firewall. 
<P>
When establishing a tunnel to any other platform, you must use a <A HREF="037_L3_Manualtunnels.html">manual
tunnel</A> configuration.
