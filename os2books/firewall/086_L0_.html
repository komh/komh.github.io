<P>
The full name of this algorithm is 'Commercial Data Masking Facility'.
<P>
CDMF is a weaker version of DES-CBC which uses only 40 bits for encryption,
and was used historically to accommodate U.S. government restrictions on
the export of DES-based cryptography; these restrictions are no longer in
force today.
<P>
Since DES is a stronger cryptographic algorithm, it should generally be
used in preference to CDMF if security is a concern.
