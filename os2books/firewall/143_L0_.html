IP packets are the electronic 'data bursts' which make up all Internet traffic.

<P>
Every IP packet is encoded with various information, such as the addresses
of the source and destination hosts, the source and destination ports, and
the transport layer protocol being used.
<P>
It is this information that allows us to filter each packet and decide whether
or not it should be allowed to proceed.
