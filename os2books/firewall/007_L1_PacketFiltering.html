<P>
The basis of the firewall's functionality is<B> IP packet filtering</B>.
 Packet filtering allows you to accept or block any <A HREF="143_L0_.html">IP
packet</A> based on certain criteria. 
<P>
In order to perform packet filtering, the firewall filter driver (FWIP.SYS)
must be installed.  While the firewall is running, the filter driver examines
every single IP packet coming into and going out of the system, and decides
whether it should be allowed to continue.  It makes this decision based
on the<B> filter rules</B> that are active.
