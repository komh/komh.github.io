<H1>IP filters for tunnelling</H1><!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
Once an IPSec tunnel has been created between two hosts, the appropriate
IP traffic must be directed through it. This is done by setting up special
packet filter rules (referred to as<B> tunnel rules</B>) which apply to
traffic transmitted between the two hosts. 
<P>
A tunnel rule uses the same general syntax as a normal 'permit' rule, with
one additional parameter: the <A HREF="024_L3_tunnel.html">tunnel parameter</A>,
which must be set to the local ID number of the tunnel being used. 
<P>
The typical configuration will simply direct all IP traffic between the
two hosts through the tunnel.  Note that rules are required for both directions
of traffic:
<BR>

<PRE>    permit &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; all any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; outbound t=&lt;tunnel&gt;
    permit &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; all any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; inbound  t=&lt;tunnel&gt;
</PRE>
 
<P>
Unlike a normal rule, a tunnel rule does not permit or deny traffic, but
simply directs the matching traffic through the IPSec tunnel with the specified
ID number. This means that additional rules must also be configured in order
to permit the necessary IP traffic. 
<P>
On a system where all IP traffic is permitted by default, the final rule
would be:
<BR>

<PRE>    permit 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 all any 0 any 0 both both both
</PRE>

<P>
and no further rules would be required. 
<P>
Otherwise, rules such as the following would be specified:
<BR>

<PRE>    permit &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; esp any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; inbound
    permit &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; esp any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; outbound
    permit &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; ah  any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; inbound
    permit &lt;partner ip&gt; &lt;partner mask&gt; &lt;local ip&gt; &lt;local mask&gt; ah  any 0 any 0 &lt;interface&gt; &lt;routing&gt; outbound
</PRE>

<P>
The first two rules permit ESP-encoded traffic to pass between the two systems;
the last two permit AH-encoded traffic.  Since all traffic which passes
through the IPSec tunnel will be encoded with one of these two protocols,
these rules should be sufficient. 
<P>
The filter rules must be activated in the normal way, using the <A HREF="048_L2_CFGFILT.html">CFGFILT
</A>command:
<BR>

<PRE>    cfgfilt -u
</PRE>
 
<P>
As always, compatible configurations must be used on both hosts.
