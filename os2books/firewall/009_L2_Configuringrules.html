<H1>Configuring rules</H1><!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
Filter rules are configured by creating rule definitions in the file
<BR>

<PRE>    %ETC%\SECURITY\FWFILTRS.CNF
</PRE>

<P>
where<I> %ETC%</I> is the directory indicated by the environment variable
<B>ETC</B>. 
<P>
Each rule occupies a single line in this file, where the top-most rule has
the highest precedence, and the last rule has the lowest precedence. 
<P>
Once the rules have been configured, you must make them 'active' by using
the command
<BR>

<PRE>   cfgfilt -u
</PRE>

<P>
to load the rules into the firewall filter driver.  (This replaces all currently-active
rules with the contents of the rule configuration file.) 
<P>

<P>
How it works
<P>
When determining whether an IP packet should be permitted or denied, the
firewall filter driver starts by checking the packet against the first active
rule.  The packet is compared to the criteria which the rule defines; if
there is a match, then the rule's specified action (either 'permit' or 'deny')
is applied to the packet.  If the packet does not match the rule, then the
filter driver moves on to the next rule down the list, and repeats the process.
 
<P>
If, when the all the rules have been checked, the packet does not match
any of them, then the packet is denied.
