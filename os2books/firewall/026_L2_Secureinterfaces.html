<H1>Secure interfaces</H1><!-- entering slot 26 -->
<P>
Many firewall computers (particularly in enterprise environments) have multiple
network interfaces, and route traffic between more than one network. 
<P>
The firewall includes a feature which allows any network interface to be
designated as a 'secure' (or 'trusted') interface.  By default, all network
interfaces which are not specifically designated as secure are 'non-secure'.
 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> These designations have no actual effect beyond allowing certain
interfaces to be classified separately for the purpose of applying different
rules to them.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Using secure interfaces 
<P>
The general theory is that a secure interface is connected to a secure or
trusted network, and can therefore afford to be less paranoid about the
traffic it allows through.  However, the manner in which secure interfaces
are to be treated is entirely up to the firewall administrator. 
<P>
The sole purpose of separating network interfaces into secure and non-secure
categories is to allow different filter rules to be specified for each.
 This is done using the <A HREF="019_L3_interface.html">interface</A> rule
parameter. 
<P>
For example, on a multi-homed web server, you may wish allow HTTP traffic
on the secure interface while blocking it on the non-secure interface.  This
could be done with the following rules:
<PRE>deny    0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  all  any 0  eq 80  non-secure  local  both
permit  0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  all  any 0  eq 80  secure      local  both
</PRE>
 
<P>
It should be noted that since the purpose of the 'secure' designation is
to allow rules to distinguish between multiple network interfaces, it is
only useful on a system with more than one interface.
<P>
 
<P>
Defining secure interfaces
<P>
To designate an interface as secure, you enter the IP address assigned to
that interface as a line in the file
<BR>

<PRE>    %ETC%\fwsecad.cnf
</PRE>

<P>
where<I> %ETC%</I> is the directory indicated by the environment variable
<B>ETC</B>.  This file does not exist by default, and must be created if
no secure interfaces were previously defined. 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> If the file<B> fwsecad.cnf</B> (above) does not exist, the
<A HREF="048_L2_CFGFILT.html">CFGFILT</A> command will display the following
warning message when run with the '-d' parameter:
<PRE>ICA1841e: Access error on file <I>%ETC%</I>\fwsecad.cnf: -1.
 Defaulting to no secure interface.
</PRE>
where<I> %ETC%</I> will be replaced by the name of the directory indicated
by the environment variable<B> ETC</B>.
<P>
This message simply means that all interfaces will default to the 'non-secure'
category.  This should be acceptable for most configurations.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
