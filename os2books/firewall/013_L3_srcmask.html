Source IP mask.

Syntax<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> (32-bit dotted-decimal IP mask)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Description
<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL>This is a 'mask' applied to the source IP address.
 It is used to indicate how much of the source IP address should be looked
at when comparing a packet against the current rule.  (The remaining portion
of the IP address is treated as an automatic match.)
<P>
Masking is done by representing both IP address and mask in binary format
and comparing each corresponding digit (bit).  Any bit in the IP address
which corresponds to a one in the mask is checked for comparison; any bit
which corresponds to a zero is treated as a wildcard and ignored.
<P>
For instance, a mask of<B> 255.192.0.0</B> is<B> 11111111.11000000.00000000.00000000
</B>in binary, which would indicate that only the first ten bits of the
source IP address are required to match in order for the rule to apply.

<P>
A value of<B> 0.0.0.0</B> means that the entire IP address is considered
a wildcard; this means that the rule applies to all possible source IP addresses.

<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> This parameter has no relation to the 'subnet mask' of the
source IP address, which is not used by the firewall.  Do not confuse the
two.<!-- lm: 0x2 14 --><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
