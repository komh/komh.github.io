<H1>Routing considerations</H1><!-- entering slot 25 -->
<P>
There are two general scenarios for using the firewall feature:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On a host operating as a gateway, routing traffic
to other hosts on a network.
<P>
In this case, the gateway host can act as a true firewall, filtering IP
packets between 'secure' and 'non-secure' networks, and preventing undesirable
traffic from passing between the two.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->On a single workstation.
<P>
IP filtering in this case would protect only the local system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Network administrators may find the former scenario useful, if there is
no need (or possibly no budget) for the more advanced protection features
of a full-fledged firewall product such as IBM SecureWay Firewall.  This
scenario will be referred to as a<B> gateway scenario</B>. 
<P>
Individual users, however, are more likely to find the firewall feature
useful for protecting a single workstation.  This scenario will be referred
to as a<B> workstation scenario</B>. 
<P>
In general, the mechanics of configuring filter rules are the same in either
case (although the rules themselves would probably be different).  There
are three filter rule parameters, however, which require special consideration:
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
<A HREF="021_L3_direction.html">direction</A><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> When
filtering traffic with an endpoint on the firewall itself, a rule will by
definition apply only to one direction of traffic (either incoming or outgoing,
depending on the source and destination parameters), even if this parameter
is set to 'both'.  This is because the source and destination parameters
are always enforced, regardless of this parameter's value.
<P>
The direction parameter becomes significant, however, when routing traffic
(such that the firewall is neither the source nor the destination).  Since
such traffic both enters and (subsequently) leaves the firewall, this parameter
can be used to control when the rule is applied.  A value of 'inbound' will
apply the rule to IP packets as they enter the firewall; a value of 'outbound'
will apply the rule to the IP packets as they leave the firewall.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> <A HREF="020_L3_routing.html">routing
</A><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL>A value of 'route' for this parameter only makes
sense under a gateway scenario.  A single workstation which is not routing
traffic has no control over packets that match this criterion, and so any
rule using it would be meaningless.
<P>
In a workstation scenario, this parameter should always be set to either
'both' or 'local' (which would in this case be functionally equivalent).
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL><A HREF="019_L3_interface.html">interface</A><!-- lm: 0x2 13 -->
<UL> This
parameter allows rules to be applied to 'secure' or 'non-secure' network
interfaces.  The distinction is only meaningful on a system with multiple
network interfaces connected to two or more different networks.
<P>
See the next section for more details.  Workstations with only one network
interface should generally use the value 'both' for this parameter.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
