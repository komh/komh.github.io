<H1>SYN attack prevention</H1><!-- entering slot 6 -->
<P>
The TCP/IP protocol layer contains two other configurable settings which
can improve the security of your system by preventing so-called<B> SYN attacks</B>.
 
<P>
A SYN attack is a malicious flood of SYN frames which can cause the TCP/IP
stack to run out of memory.  The defense against this form of attack can
be activated or disabled by means of the 'synattack' and 'syncookie' parameters.
 
<P>
As with other IP protocol settings, this is done using the INETCFG command.
 Although it can be done manually, the recommended method is to create the
file<B> INETCFG.INI</B> in the directory indicated by the environment variable
<B>ETC</B>, and add the lines:
<BR>

<PRE>    synattack 1
    syncookie 1
</PRE>
 
<P>
Then create or edit the file<I> x</I>:\TCPIP\BIN\B4TCP.CMD (where<I> x</I> is
the letter of the drive or volume on which TCP/IP is installed) and add
the line:
<BR>

<PRE>    IF EXIST %ETC%\INETCFG.INI CALL inetcfg.exe -set all
</PRE>

<P>
(This file will be called automatically by the TCP/IP startup routine.)
 
<P>

<P>
Optionally, you can also configure other INETCFG parameters by adding them
to INETCFG.INI.  For more information about INETCFG and the various other
parameters which are available, refer to the TCP/IP Command Reference.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> The 'syncookie' option is only available in MPTS V5.5 (WR_8620)
and up.
