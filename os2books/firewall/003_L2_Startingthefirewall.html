<H1>Starting the firewall</H1><!-- entering slot 3 -->
<P>
Starting the firewall involves activating IP packet filtering.  This is
done with the <A HREF="048_L2_CFGFILT.html">CFGFILT</A> utility. 
<P>
To start the firewall, use the command:
<BR>

<PRE>    cfgfilt -u -i
</PRE>

<P>
(This command is explained in more detail below.) 
<P>

<P>
Starting the firewall automatically 
<P>
You can configure your system so that the firewall task will start automatically
when the system boots.  The easiest way of doing this is to create or edit
the file
<BR>

<PRE>    <I>x</I>:\TCPIP\BIN\TCPEXIT.CMD
</PRE>

<P>
where<I> x</I> is the drive letter of the volume on which TCP/IP is installed,
and add the line
<BR>

<PRE>    CALL CFGFILT.EXE -u -i
</PRE>

<P>
This file will be called automatically by the TCP/IP startup routines when
the system boots.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you wish to enable firewall logging, you should add the
'-d' parameter to the CFGFILT command line.  See the section <A HREF="029_L2_Enablinglogging.html">Enabling
logging</A> for more information. 
<P>

<P>
Detailed explanation
<P>
The above syntax for the CFGFILT command performs the following actions:
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Activates the firewall flag within the IP layer.
<P>
This is a TCP/IP protocol setting which enables or disables the firewall.
 It must be enabled before the firewall will function.  The '-u' parameter
to CFGFILT will automatically enable this flag if it is not already enabled.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Loads the filter rules from the rule configuration
file.
<P>
Filter rules specify the criteria by which TCP/IP traffic is permitted or
denied by the firewall.  If no rules are defined, then the firewall's default
behaviour is to deny all TCP/IP traffic, both inbound and outbound.  The
'-u' parameter to CFGFILT loads filter rules from the rule configuration
file into the filter driver. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Initializes the filter driver and activates IP filtering.

<P>
Once the firewall is enabled and filter rules have been loaded, the IP filtering
task must be activated.  The '-i' parameter to CFGFILT does this.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Each of these actions is explained more fully in a later part of this book.
 
<P>

<P>
Checking the current state
<P>
You can verify that filtering is active by running the CFGFILT command without
any parameters.  (As the output is quite lengthy, you will need to run the
command from a prompt with scrollback capability, or else pipe the output
through 'more'.) 
<P>
If you issue the command
<PRE>    cfgfilt |more
</PRE>

<P>
you should see, near the top of the output, the heading 'Status of filter
support code'. This should display the status 'active'.  If it shows 'inactive',
then IP filtering is not active (meaning that the firewall is not currently
functioning).
