<H1>Using IPSec tunnels</H1><!-- entering slot 40 -->
<P>
Dynamic tunnels are relatively easy to use, by means of the <A HREF="054_L2_SRIP.html">graphical
interface</A> provided with TCP/IP V4.1 and above.  For this reason, and
because dynamic tunnels may only be used to connect with an AIX SecureWay
Firewall server, this book does not discuss them further.  A detailed example
of using dynamic tunnels is provided in chapter 7 of IBM RedBook SG23-5201-00,
<I>A Comprehensive Guide to Virtual Private Networks, Volume I: IBM Firewall,
Server and Client Solutions</I> 
<P>
The remainder of this chapter is concerned with the configuration and use
of manual tunnels. 
<P>
Setting up a manual IPSec tunnel involves the following steps:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Install the <A HREF="040_L3_IPSecdevicedrivers.html">device
drivers</A> for packet filtering, IPSec and the encryption algorithms you
will use.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create the tunnel by means of a <A HREF="041_L3_Tunnelcontextentries.html">tunnel
context entry</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Define the tunnel's behaviour by creating a <A HREF="042_L3_Tunnelpolicies.html">tunnel
policy</A>.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Create <A HREF="043_L3_IPfiltersfortunnelli.html">filter
rules</A> which will direct the appropriate IP traffic through the tunnel.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
These steps are described over the next several pages.

<P>
The following conventions are used in this section:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The current system is referred to as the 'local host'.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The system on the other end of the tunnel is referred
to as the 'partner host'.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The directory indicated by the environment variable
<B>ETC</B> is listed as '%ETC%'.  On most systems, this defaults to the
directory '<I>x</I>:\MPTN\ETC' (where<I> x</I> is the drive on which MPTS
is installed).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
