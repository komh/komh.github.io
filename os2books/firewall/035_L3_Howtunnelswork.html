<H1>How tunnels work</H1><!-- entering slot 35 -->
<P>
An IPSec tunnel is typically thought of as a discrete two-way logical connection
between two systems.  However, each tunnel is actually made up of complementary
unidirectional connections called<B> Security Associations</B>, or SAs.
 
<P>
Each SA is identified by a 32-bit number called the <A HREF="084_L0_.html">Security
Parameter Index</A> or<B> SA ID</B>.
<P>
SAs define the attributes of an IPSec tunnel, the most important of which
is the<B> security protocol</B> being used. 
<P>
The security protocol determines how data traffic which passes through the
tunnel is to be encoded and decoded.  There are two different protocols;
either or <A HREF="085_L0_.html">both</A> may be used in any given IPSec
tunnel, depending on what form of <A HREF="083_L0_.html">security</A> is
required.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> Authentication Header</B> (AH) protocol provides
origin authentication for the entire IP packet, but not data confidentiality.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The<B> Encapsulating Security Payload</B> (ESP) protocol
provides both origin authentication and data confidentiality (encryption).
 However, ESP's origin authentication only protects the payload of the IP
packet, not the IP header.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
These security protocols operate by encoding every IP packet sent over the
tunnel, using a predetermined<B> algorithm</B>. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Both protocols use an asymmetric hash algorithm to
provide origin authentication. Some IPSec platforms have several different
algorithms available, but the present implementation is limited to the<B> Keyed
MD5</B> algorithm.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->The ESP protocol uses a symmetric (secret key) algorithm
to encrypt packets for data confidentiality.  The available algorithms are
<A HREF="086_L0_.html">CDMF</A> (40-bit) and <A HREF="087_L0_.html">DES-CBC
</A>(56-bit).  DES-CBC is a more secure algorithm, and should be used instead
of CDMF whenever possible.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
<B>Note: </B> The DES-CBC algorithm is only available in MPTS V5.4 (WR_8610)
and above.  MPTS V5.3 (which came with TCP/IP V4.1) did not include the
DES module due to U.S. Government export restrictions which were in effect
at the time of release.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<P>
 
<P>
Transport vs. tunnel mode
<P>
With either protocol, there are two different ways in which IPSec may encode
an IP packet. <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In<B> transport mode</B>, the original IP packet has
its payload encoded, but not its IP header.  The AH or ESP header is placed
around the payload portion of the packet. In the case of ESP, the original
IP header information (including the packet's source and destination information)
is not encrypted.  AH, however, provies origin authentication for the entire
packet, except for certain mutable fields.
<P>
Transport mode is normally used in IPSec tunnels between individual hosts.
 Gateways, on the other hand, are not even required to support transport
mode (although most do).<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In<B> tunnel mode</B>, the entire original IP packet
is encoded, then encapsulated as the payload of a new IP packet.  This provides
complete protection for the original IP packet (but not for the new, outermost,
IP header).
<P>
Tunnel mode is required when either end of the IPSec tunnel is a gateway,
unless the actual data traffic is destined for the gateway itself.  Tunnel
mode has a higher overhead than transport mode.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
Note that the term 'tunnel mode' has no relation to the term 'IPSec tunnel'.
 An IPSec tunnel may use either transport or tunnel mode. 
<P>
When using tunnels in transport mode, you must disable the 'MTU Path<!-- entering slot 36 --> Discovery'
feature of the IP layer.  This can be done with the command
