<H1>Definition of an IPSec tunnel</H1><!-- entering slot 34 -->
<P>
The purpose of a Virtual Private Network is to allow the <A HREF="083_L0_.html">secure
</A>transmission of traffic over a non-secure network.  To accomplish this,
the firewall feature uses a standard called<B> IPSec</B> (IP Security Architecture).
 
<P>
Unlike many application-layer security protocols (such as SOCKS, SSH or
S-HTTP), IPSec is implemented on the network layer, within the IP protocol
stack.  This means that all IP-based network traffic may be transmitted
securely, without any application software needing to be aware of the process.
 
<P>
An<B> IPSec tunnel</B> is a bidirectional secure logical connection between
two systems.  IPSec tunnels form the means by which Virtual Private Networks
are established. Traffic which is transmitted through an IPSec tunnel is
encoded to provide the necessary security when passing through an untrusted
network. 
<P>
There are three general scenarios in which IPSec tunnels are used:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Connecting a workstation to a secure network over
a non-secure network.  This typically involves a computer establishing an
IPSec tunnel over the Internet (or some other non-secure network) to a firewall
protecting the secure network.  The firewall acts as a router for traffic
between the secure and non-secure networks.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="034_L2_DefinitionofanIPSect_0.gif" WIDTH=371 HEIGHT=95 ALIGN=center>
<P>
In this case, the workstation would be considered the 'client', and the
firewall would be considered the 'server'.  These terms are used occasionally
when discussing IPSec connections of this type (although IPSec itself has
no inherent concept of clients and servers). <!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Connecting two secure networks together over a non-secure
network.  This scenario would involve two firewalls (each routing traffic
for their secure networks) establishing an IPSec tunnel over a non-secure
network such as the Internet.  This would, in effect, link the two secure
networks together into a single 'virtual' secure network.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="034_L2_DefinitionofanIPSect_1.gif" WIDTH=445 HEIGHT=95 ALIGN=center>
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Connecting two individual workstations together for
the secure exchange of data traffic over an non-secure network.  This is
the least-common scenario, as its usefulness is somewhat limited.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="034_L2_DefinitionofanIPSect_2.gif" WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=95 ALIGN=center><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> 
<P>
The basic principles of configuring and establishing IPSec tunnels are the
same in all three scenarios. 
<P>
Note that it is also possible to combine these scenarios by nesting tunnels
inside other tunnels; in effect, establishing one VPN inside another.
