<H1>Viewing log files</H1><!-- entering slot 31 -->
<P>
A new log file is created for every day on which log entries are generated.
 Log files are placed in the directory indicated by the<B> FWLOGS</B> environment
variable if defined, or the<B> ETC</B> directory otherwise. 
<P>
Log files have the name 'fw<I>mmdd</I>', where<I> mm</I> is the two-digit
month number, and<I> dd</I> is the two-digit day number.  For example, the
log file for March 16th would be named 'fw0316'. 
<P>
Log files are stored as ASCII text, but they are not in human-readable format.
 In addition, the current day's log file is locked while the logging daemon
is running. For these reasons, you must use the <A HREF="052_L2_FWLSLOG.html">FWLSLOG
</A>command in order to view the contents of a log file. 
<P>
The command to view a log file is
<BR>

<PRE>    fwlslog file=<I>&lt;filename&gt;</I>
</PRE>

<P>
where<I> &lt;filename&gt;</I> is the name of the log file to be viewed.
 
<P>
Because the output can be quite lengthy (depending on the size of the log
file), it may be necessary to use this command from within a scrollable
console window, such as is provided by the Enhanced Editor (<B>epm 'shell'</B>).
