</UL> Description<!-- lm: 0x2 14 -->
<UL> Indicates
the packet's destination IP address (the IP address to which the packet
wishes to be delivered).
<P>
Address ranges can be indicated in conjunction with the <A HREF="015_L3_destmask.html">destmask
</A>parameter.  Only the masked portion of the IP address (corresponding
to a one bit in the mask when both are represented in binary) is actually
used for comparison; this treated as the IP network number.  (The remaining,
unmasked, portion is treated as a wildcard.)
<P>
A filter rule can thus indicate 'any IP address' by setting the<B> destmask
</B>parameter to<B> 0.0.0.0</B>.  (In this case,<B> destip</B> should also
be set to<B> 0.0.0.0</B> to avoid confusion.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
