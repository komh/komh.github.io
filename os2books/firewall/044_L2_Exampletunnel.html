<H1>Example tunnel</H1><!-- entering slot 45 -->
<P>
In this example, a simple tunnel will be created between two hosts:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
Host A<!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> 192.168.2.1<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>Host B<!-- lm: 0x2 15 -->
<UL> 192.168.2.4<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> 
</UL>The tunnel will use the ESP protocol in tunnel
mode, utilizing the DES_CBC_8 encryption algorithm.  The AH protocol will
not be used.  The tunnel will have a lifetime of 8 hours, starting from
the moment the tunnel is activated.
