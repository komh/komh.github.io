<P>
A "TRAP" IS THE METHOD THE PROCESSOR USED TO INFORM THE OPERATING SYSTEM
THAT AN UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION HAS BEEN DETECTED.
<P>
TRAP ERRORS CAN BE CAUSED BY BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE.  SOME OF THE ERRORS
ARE DOUBLE FAULT, PROTECTION VIOLATION, ETC.  THE MOST COMMON OF THESE IS
A TRAP 0002 WHICH IS CAUSED BY AN NMI (NON-MASKED INTERRUPT).  AN NMI CAN
BE CAUSED BY A MEMORY PARITY ERROR, A CHANNEL ERROR, A BUS TIMEOUT, OR A
WATCHDOG TIMER TIMOUT.  THE MOST COMMON OF THESE IS MEMORY PARITY ERROR.

<P>
A TRAP 0002 MEMORY PARITY ERROR EXPERIENCED WHILE RUNNING OS/2 WILL BE ACCOMPANIED
BY AN ERROR MESSAGE SCREEN WHICH WILL INFORM THE OPERATOR THAT THE ERROR
WAS ON THE SYSTEM BOARD MEMORY, OR AN OPTION CARD (EXPANSION MEMORY).
<P>
NOTE 1. THE DATA REGISTERS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN BY OS/2 DO NOT CORRELATE
TO AN ACTUAL FAILING MEMORY MODULE OR ADDRESS AND ARE INVALID FOR HARDWARE
PROBLEM DETERMINATION. HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION IS MEANINGFUL FOR SOME
TYPES OF SOFTWARE PROBLEM DETERMINATION, SUCH AS TRAP 000D ERRORS.
<P>
NOTE 2. PS/2 SYSTEMS HAVE NO MEMORY ERROR CORRECTION HARDWARE, THEREFORE
ANY PARITY ERROR WILL CAUSE A SYSTEM HALT WITH THE APPROPRIATE FAILURE INDICATIONS
DEPENDING UPON THE OPERATING SYSTEM.
