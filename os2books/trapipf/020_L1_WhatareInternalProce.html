<H1>What are Internal Processing Errors?</H1><!-- entering slot 20 -->
<P>
   Although not exactly a trap error, an Internal Processing Error (IPE)
is associated with a<B> SYS1915</B> error, which can be caused by the same
conditions as a trap error and subsequently are solved in the same manner.
 The key to determining the type of error is in interpreting the error message.
 A message "The system has detected an internal processing error at location
##0160:FFF6FC01-000D:00015C01....."  would tell you that you should follow
the trouble shooting procedures for a trap 000D error.  Locate the error
message by finding the three zeros followed by a letter or number (...01-000D:00...).
 In the IPE message, it will generally fall after the first cluster of digits.
