<H1>About this Guide.</H1><!-- entering slot 0 -->
<P>
   This guide was painstakingly put together by digging through every available
on-line database, textbook and any other resource I could get my hands on.
 Although this isn't all encompassing (as I mention later, there are over
4200 cases dealing with trap errors on Retain), it is intended to:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->

</UL>   <B><I>NOTE:</B></I>  When searching this document
for text on these errors, be aware that all references to trap errors are
in the full hex address and your searches should incorporate that.  For
example, search for a trap D by using 000D as your search argument.
<P>
   Should you find a glaring omission, an egregious error or something additional
that should be added to this file, please contact Keith Hoffman, Kim Stewart,
or Derek Berube with the info so we can do the update.
<P>
   As with any major publication, this would not be possible without the
help, assistance and cajoling of the following people:  Marvin Beadnall,
Robert Kees, and Derek Berube, who not only provided the inspiration to
do something impressive for work, but even more important, showed me how
to get this document on line.
<P>
   This trap guide was updated in spring of 1994 by Kim Stewart.  Version
2.01 includes additional information about typical causes of each type of
trap error and hints for using RETAIN when troubleshooting.  Thanks to Chuck
Clifton and Derek Berube for sharing their insights and suggestions.
