<UL> Definitely check RETAIN
for similar errors.  A number of Trap 000D errors are caused by software
bugs.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> If the error occurs
every time within the same application and CHKDSK doesn't correct the problem,
contact the software developer for further assistance.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Check hardware.  Trap 000D errors are occassionally
caused by hardware problems.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

using the enhanced memory adapter on a model 80-111 or 80-311 and it's in
slot #1, move to slot #4.  If already there, verify that the resistors are
positioned diagonally across the modules.  If these resistors are not present,
replace the adapter with PN 34F2825.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> If
this occurs during installation, test the system memory, any memory adapters
and the system board.  Replace as necessary.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<UL> If
it occurs within a Token Ring environment, ensure the Token Ring RAM window
is set at 16 KB.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
