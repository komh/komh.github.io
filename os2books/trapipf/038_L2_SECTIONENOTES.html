<P>
<U><I>NOTE 1.</I></U>  MEMORY INTENSIVE OPERATING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS OS/2,
AIX AND OTHERS ARE CAPABLE OF REVEALING HIGHLY INTERMITTENT MEMORY BIT FAILURES
WHICH DIAGNOSTICS MAY NOT REVEAL.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 2.</I></U>  HIGHLY INTERMITTENT ERRORS MAY GO UNDETECTED BY ANY
MEMORY DIAGNOSTIC IF NO FAILURE ACTUALLY OCCURS DURING THE TEST.  MULTIPLE
REPLACEMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ISOLATE THE FAILURE IN EXTREME CASES.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 3.</I></U>  IF POSSIBLE, THE OPERATING SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE ALL
SOFTWARE UPDATES INSTALLED, PRIOR TO EXTENSIVE HARDWARE TROUBLESHOOTING.
 SOFTWARE "BUGS" HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BE A CAUSE, OR CONTRIBUTE, TO TRAP ERRORS.
 THE APPROPRIATE SOFTWARE SUPPORT ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE CONTACTED CONCERNING
THE AVAILABILITY OF UPDATES.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 4.</I></U>  SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE THE ENHANCED 80386 MEMORY EXPANSION
ADAPTER INSTALLED (FRU P/N34F2825) MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE OS/2 TRAP ERRORS
IF THE ENHANCED 80386 MEMORY ADAPTER DOES NOT HAVE RESISTORS LOCATED DIAGONALLY
ACROSS THE MODULES LOCATED IN POSITIONS U21, U22, U23, AND U24.  RETAIN
RECORD #H037481 SHOULD BE REFERENCED FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 5.</I></U>  INTERMITTENT SYSTEMS ERRORS CAN BE CAUSED BY OUTSIDE
SOURCES OF NOISE, STATIC, AND SEVERE POWER-LINE DISTURBANCES.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 6.</I></U> TRAP 0002:  MEMORY FAILURES UNDER DOS COULD DISPLAY
A 110 MEMORY FAILURE, WHILE FAILURES RUNNING UNDER OS/2 COULD DISPLAY A
TRAP 0002 OR A TRAP 000C ERROR MESSAGE.  AIX WILL GIVE AN NMI ERROR. THE
OS/2 ERROR MESSAGE WILL INFORM THE USER THAT THE OPERATING SYSTEM HAS DETECTED
A HARDWARE MEMORY ERROR ON THE SYSTEM BOARD OR ON AN OPTION CARD.  (REFER
TO SECTION G. OF THIS TIP)
<P>
THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF TRAP 0002 ERROR IS CAUSED BY MEMORY, BUT IT MAY
ON SOME OCCASIONS BE CAUSED BY A SYSTEM BOARD OR A MICRO CHANNEL ADAPTER
FAILURE.  IT MAY ALSO BE CAUSED BY OTHER HARDWARE FAILURES OR SOFTWARE ERRORS.
 REFER TO SECTION G. FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICE AID INFORMATION.
<P>
THE MOST EFFECTIVE TROUBLESHOOTING METHOD FOR MEMORY ERRORS IS TO READ THE
ERROR MESSAGE FROM THE OPERATING SYSTEM CAREFULLY. IF IT INDICATES A TRAP
0002 ON THE SYSTEM BOARD , REPLACE THE MEMORY ON THE SYSTEM BOARD.  IF IT
INDICATES A TRAP 0002 ERROR ON AN OPTION CARD, THE MEMORY ON THE EXPANSION
ADAPTER SHOULD BE REPLACED.  CONTINUE THE REPLACEMENT PROCESS WITH THE MEMORY
EXPANSION SIMS UNTIL THE FAILURE NO LONGER OCCURS.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 7.</I></U> TRAP 000D:  (TRAP000D) ERRORS ARE USUALLY RELATED
TO SOFTWARE PROBLEMS AND MAY BE CAUSED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING
ERRORS. THE APPROPRIATE SOFTWARE SUPPORT GROUP SHOULD BE CONSULTED FOR TRAP
000D ERRORS.
<P>
<U><I>NOTE 8.</I></U>  FOR 8570 MODELS A61, A21, B61, B21 OR 8580 MODELS
A21, A31 AND A16 EXPERIENCING TRAP 0002 ERRORS, ECA059 AND ECA051 RESPECTIVELY,
SHOULD BE REFERENCED.
