<P>
   <B>For trap 0002 errors, try the following:</B><B><I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> See <A HREF="036_L2_SECTIONCTRAPNUMBERTA.html">Retain
Tip #H083121, Section C</A> for several known causes of Trap 0002 Errors.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Check hardware, especially
memory.  Trap 0002 errors are caused almost exclusively by hardware problems.
 The most common type of Trap 0002 is caused by a failing memory module.
 (This is the equivalent of a memory parity error under DOS.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>If there is an enhanced 80386 memory expansion adapter
installed, ensure the resistors are installed diagonally on the adapter.
 (See Retain Tip #H037481 for additional details.)<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>If error is received after installing new memory,
ensure the SIMMs are supported on the system. (Both speed and manufacturer)
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Ensure that faster memory
is installed before slower memory. Run advanced diagnostics to ensure memory
has not failed.  If bad SIMMs are detected, replace.  If none are, suspect
the system board and have it inspected.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> On
8570-A61, -A21, -B61, -B21 or 8580-A21, -A31, -A16, refer to ECA 051 and
ECA 059 respectively.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> If
the system has a non-IBM EGA adapter card, disable the adapter's auto-switch
function.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> If system is
a MCA machine, check to see if there are any applicable ECA's.</B></I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
