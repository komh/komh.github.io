<H1>What exactly is a trap error?</H1><!-- entering slot 1 -->
<P>
   A trap error, which can be caused by either software or hardware, occurs
when the processor<I> "traps"</I> an interrupt or exception and reports
it to the operating system. An interrupt is defined as an event external
to the processor that occurs randomly during system operation.  The only
time an exception can occur is when a special condition is detected by the
processor during the execution of a set of instructions.
<P>
   There are actually 256 possible trap errors, although we will only concern
ourselves with the first 17 (0-16).  These are all exceptions, except for
trap 0002, which is a non-maskable interrupt (more on that later).  Trap
errors 17-31 are exceptions reserved by Intel and 32-255 are user defined
maskable interrupts.
