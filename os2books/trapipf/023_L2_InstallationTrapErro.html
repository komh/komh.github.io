<P>
   TRAP errors received during the installation of OS/2 are often caused
by hardware problems.  If a customer is receiving any kind of TRAP error
during install, try the following:<B><I><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Disable external RAM cache.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Disable
video and ROM shadowing.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Turn

</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>Remove all extra

</UL></B></I>
<P>
   For more information on installation Trap errors, there is an excellent
reference available on VM.  Look for the files INSIN2 (INF version) and
INSINF (ASCII text version) in the OS2PROD directory of TOOLCAT.  Both of
these files contain an extensive listing of problem reports, fixes, and
work-arounds for OS/2 2.1 installation problems.  It also contains copies
of relevent informational APARs and README files.
