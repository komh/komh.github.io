<P>
An erroneous Trap Error may be caused by the occurrence of multiple Non
Maskable Interrupt (NMI) errors.  The first NMI error puts the machine into
its error recovery process.  While the PS/2 is in the error recovery process,
a second NMI error occurs.  The second error happening before the first
error is completely processed, results in an erroneous TRAP error larger
than '00FF' being displayed by the error handler (ie, Trap 0458 or Trap
01FF).
<P>
The servicer should use their Service Aid Diskette to determine the correct
Trap Error located in NVRAM. The last error logged in NVRAM is the TRAP
Error that needs to be addressed. Normal Trap Error guidelines should be
used to determine what action should be taken based on the error listed
in NVRAM.
