   The following should be a guide on how to handle most trap (and IPE)
errors.  Please realize that this will not cover every possible instance
of trap errors, there are over 4200 cases in Retain about them.  This is
to assist in some of the more routine cases that you will encounter.
<P>
   The first step in problem resolution is to run CHKDSK C: /F after booting
to diskette (use the /F:3 parameter if the drive is formatted HPFS). This
may sound like a simplistic answer to a complex problem, but a lot of trap
errors occur because of file corruption,  and CHKDSK should take care of
most of these problems. Make sure to run CHKDSK after booting and not while
in an OS/2 window or full screen.  The system won't allow the /F parameter
on a drive that it is using.
<P>
   It may also be helpful to copy the default CONFIG.SYS from the \OS2\INSTALL
directory to the root directory.  Some Trap errors can be caused by problems
in the CONFIG.SYS file.  In particular, a faulty device driver loading in
CONFIG.SYS could cause the system to trap.
<P>
   The next step is to ensure the most current CSD installed on the system.
 If they're running 1.3, make sure they have the latest CSDs installed (SYSLEVEL
XR05150 for SE, WR05200 for EE).  If they're running 2.0 or 2.1, make sure
the Service Pack (SYSLEVEL XR06100 for OS/2 2.0, XR06200 for OS/2 2.1, XR06300
for OS/2 2.1 for Windows) is installed. Some trap errors that occurred previously
can be corrected by just updating the CSD level.
<P>
   If these steps don't correct the problem, search on RETAIN for similar
cases.  To effectively use RETAIN, it is important to have the register
information from the customer's error, particularly the CS:EIP and CSLIM
registers from a TRAP, as well as any IPE locations.  Many known problems
are specific to the CS:EIP and CSLIM locations, so searching on these values
could greatly reduce the time spent on trouble shooting.  The following
is an example of an OS/2 2.1 32-bit TRAP error, with the most important
registers highlighted:
